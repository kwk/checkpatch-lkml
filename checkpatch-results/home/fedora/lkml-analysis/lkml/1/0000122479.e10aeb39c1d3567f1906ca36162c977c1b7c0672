CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#97: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:48:
+#define SVM_FEATURE_PAUSE_FILTER (1 << 10)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#142: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2286:
+extern void sched_delay_yield(unsigned long ns);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#144: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2288:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#177: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1960:
+	struct task_struct *curr = current;
+	if (curr->sched_class == &fair_sched_class) {

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#177: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1960:
+	if (curr->sched_class == &fair_sched_class) {

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
