WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#48: 
#define C E

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'BlockMap[block] != BLOCK_NIL'
#93: FILE: drivers/mtd/inftlcore.c:284:
+			if ((BlockMap[block] != BLOCK_NIL) ||
+			    BlockDeleted[block])

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#157: FILE: drivers/mtd/nftlcore.c:434:
+	oob.u.a.ReplUnitNum = oob.u.a.SpareReplUnitNum = BLOCK_NIL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
