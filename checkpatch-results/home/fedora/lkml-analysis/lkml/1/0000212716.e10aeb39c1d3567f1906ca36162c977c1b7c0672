WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#72: FILE: include/linux/stop_machine.h:15:
+	int ret;
+	local_irq_disable();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#121: FILE: kernel/stop_machine.c:165:
+	BUG_ON(!stop_machine_wq);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
