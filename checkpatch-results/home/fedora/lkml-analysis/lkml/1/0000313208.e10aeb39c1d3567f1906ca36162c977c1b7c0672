WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#137: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/config.c:1866:
+#if defined(CONFIG_HISAX_SCT_QUADRO)
 	{PCI_VENDOR_ID_ZORAN,    PCI_DEVICE_ID_ZORAN_36120,      PCI_ANY_ID,PCI_ANY_ID},

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#171: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/telespci.c:293:
+	struct pci_dev *dev_tel = (void *) card->para[0];

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#209: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/telespci.c:315:

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
