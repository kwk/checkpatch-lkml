Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#91: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1765:
+	if (wakeup_events) {
[...]
+	} else if (handle->wakeup)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#93: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1767:
+		int events = atomic_inc_return(&handle->data->events);
+		if (events >= wakeup_events) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
