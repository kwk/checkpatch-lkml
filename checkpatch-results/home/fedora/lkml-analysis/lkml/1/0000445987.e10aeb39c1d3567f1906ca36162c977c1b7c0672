Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#381: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:365:
+			 struct seq_operations *seq_ops)

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
