#37: 
Memory may be hot-removed on a per-memory-block basis, particularly on POWER

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#148: FILE: include/linux/memory_hotplug.h:204:
+extern int is_mem_section_removable(unsigned long pfn, unsigned long nr_pages);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#152: FILE: include/linux/memory_hotplug.h:208:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#184: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:531:
+	BUG_ON(page_to_pfn(page) & (pageblock_nr_pages - 1));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
