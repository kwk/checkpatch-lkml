2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

commit 7c6db4e050601f359081fde418ca6dc4fc2d0011 upstream.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#109: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:74:
+#define ACPI_EC_STORM_THRESHOLD 20	/* number of false interrupts
+					   per one transaction */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#202: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:196:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
