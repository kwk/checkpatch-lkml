Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#68: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-top.c:101:
+static int			freq				= 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#88: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-top.c:894:
+		case 'F': freq = 1; default_interval	=   atoi(optarg); break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
