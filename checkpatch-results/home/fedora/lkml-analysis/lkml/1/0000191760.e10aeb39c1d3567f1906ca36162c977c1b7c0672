#30: 
Some apparently left over cruft code was complicating the fault logic.  Testing if uval != -EFAULT doesn't have any meaning, get_user() sets ret to either 0 or -EFAULT, there's no need to compare uval, especially not against EFAULT which it will never be.  This patch removes the superfluous test and clarifies the comment blocks.
