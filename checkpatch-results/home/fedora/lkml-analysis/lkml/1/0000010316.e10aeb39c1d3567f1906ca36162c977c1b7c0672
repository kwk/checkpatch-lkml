Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sk->sk_send_head"
#170: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:2459:
+	    tcp_is_sack(tp) && sk->sk_send_head == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
