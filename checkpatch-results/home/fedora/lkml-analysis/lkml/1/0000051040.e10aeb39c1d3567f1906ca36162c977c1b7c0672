WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct net_device *' should also have an identifier name
#66: FILE: drivers/net/bonding/bond_main.c:694:
+	int (*ioctl)(struct net_device *, struct ifreq *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ifreq *' should also have an identifier name
#66: FILE: drivers/net/bonding/bond_main.c:694:
+	int (*ioctl)(struct net_device *, struct ifreq *, int);
