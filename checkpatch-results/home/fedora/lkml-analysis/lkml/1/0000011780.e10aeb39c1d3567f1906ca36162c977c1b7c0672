Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#130: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-magicmouse.c:190:
+			stepy = (msc->touches[id].scroll_y - y) / accel_profile[msc->scroll_accel_y];

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
