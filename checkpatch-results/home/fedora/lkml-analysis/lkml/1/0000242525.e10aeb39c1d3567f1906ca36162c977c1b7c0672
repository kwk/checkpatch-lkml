CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#263: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:160:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#422: FILE: include/asm-x86/ftrace.h:22:
+extern void arch_ftrace_pre_enable(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#437: FILE: include/asm-x86/thread_info.h:33:
+	unsigned long		**ip;		/* pointer to ip on stackwhen
+						   preempted

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
