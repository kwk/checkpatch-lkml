WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#54: FILE: kernel/kexec.c:1126:
+	buf = (u32*)CPU_PTR(crash_notes, cpu);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#63: FILE: kernel/kexec.c:1140:
+	crash_notes = CPU_ALLOC(note_buf_t, GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_ZERO);
 	                                              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
