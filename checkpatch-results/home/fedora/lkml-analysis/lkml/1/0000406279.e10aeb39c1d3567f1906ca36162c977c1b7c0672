WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#42: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:134:
+extern int FASTCALL(queue_work_cpu(struct workqueue_struct *wq, struct work_struct *work, int cpu));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#59: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:184:
+		BUG_ON(!list_empty(&work->entry));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
