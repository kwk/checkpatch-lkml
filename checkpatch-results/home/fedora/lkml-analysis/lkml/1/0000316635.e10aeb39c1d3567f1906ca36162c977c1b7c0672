CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!uninorth_node"
#85: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/powermac/feature.c:2580:
+	if (uninorth_node == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#115: FILE: drivers/macintosh/smu.c:139:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#176: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/pmac_feature.h:402:
+extern int pmac_get_uninorth_variant(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
