#35: 
Can we only move the struct wacom_features definition to wacom_sys.c and leave the device specific wacom_features in wacom_wac.c?  Also leave the actual wacom_ids [] in wacom_wac.c as well since they are wacom specific stuff.  We'd like to keep wacom specific stuff in wacom_wac.c/h, which hopefully can be shared among kernel releases.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct wacom_features should normally be const

+static struct wacom_features wacom_features[] = {};

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
