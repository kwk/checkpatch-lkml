WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'defualt' may be misspelled - perhaps 'default'?
#29: 
that uses the defualt linker script so section does not get renamed.
              ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'the'
#31: 
The vmlinux.o may later be used as part of the the final link of vmlinux

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'fo' may be misspelled - perhaps 'of'?
#32: 
but for now it is used fo section mismatch only.
                       ^^

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#69: FILE: Makefile:748:
+	$(Q)$(MAKE) -f $(srctree)/scripts/Makefile.modpost $@

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
