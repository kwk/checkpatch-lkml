Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#83: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:3106:
+__ATTR(sync_min, S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR, min_sync_show, min_sync_store);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
