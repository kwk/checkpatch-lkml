WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#37: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#42: FILE: fs/unionfs/rdstate.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#84: FILE: fs/unionfs/rdstate.c:43:
+	return (unionfs_filldir_cachep ? 0 : -ENOMEM);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

WARNING:NEEDLESS_IF: kmem_cache_destroy(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required
#90: FILE: fs/unionfs/rdstate.c:49:

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#132: FILE: fs/unionfs/rdstate.c:91:
+	BUG_ON(sizeof(loff_t) !=

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "rdstate"
#134: FILE: fs/unionfs/rdstate.c:93:
+	BUG_ON(UNIONFS_F(file)->rdstate != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around state->list[i]
#217: FILE: fs/unionfs/rdstate.c:176:
+		struct list_head *head = &(state->list[i]);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
