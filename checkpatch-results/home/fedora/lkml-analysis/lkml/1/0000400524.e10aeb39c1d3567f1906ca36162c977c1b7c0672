      kbuild: fix up printing of Linux C Library version in scripts/ver_linux

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "menu->sym"
#312: FILE: scripts/kconfig/kxgettext.c:173:
+	if (menu->sym != NULL && menu_has_help(menu))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
