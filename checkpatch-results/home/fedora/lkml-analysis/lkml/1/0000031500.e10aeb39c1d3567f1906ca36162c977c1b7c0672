The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#77: FILE: drivers/firmware/memmap.c:127:
+static int add_sysfs_fw_map_entry(struct firmware_map_entry *entry) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
