CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#110: FILE: kernel/fork.c:859:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#141: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1400:
