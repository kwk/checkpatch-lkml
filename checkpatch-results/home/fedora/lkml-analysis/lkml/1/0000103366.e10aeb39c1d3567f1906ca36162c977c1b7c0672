ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#118: FILE: fs/exec.c:1721:
+	struct inode * inode = NULL;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'core_pipe_limit < dump_count'
#137: FILE: fs/exec.c:1805:
+		if (core_pipe_limit && (core_pipe_limit < dump_count)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
