CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#71: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:69:
+#define SWAPFLAG_UNUSED_IOCTL (1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#93: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:288:
+				blkdev_ioctl(p->swap_file->f_mapping->host, p->swap_file, BLKSWAPMARKUNUSED, offset);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
