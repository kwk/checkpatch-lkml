WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#57: FILE: drivers/char/Kconfig:61:
+config VT_CKO
+	bool "Colored kernel message output"
+	depends on VT_CONSOLE
+	---help---
+	This option enables kernel messages to be emitted in
+	colors other than the default.
+	This option enlarges your kernel by approximately 1/2 KB.
+
+	If unsure, say N.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#121: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2398:
+module_param(printk_color, uint, S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
