ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I * Failures after this point use release_tty to clean up, so $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#149: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2140:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
