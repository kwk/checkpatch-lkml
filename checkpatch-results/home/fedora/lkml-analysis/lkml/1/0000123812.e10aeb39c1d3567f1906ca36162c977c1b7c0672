WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#84: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cs.c:341:
+    pr_notice("ide-cs: ide_config failed memory allocation\n");$

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ide_config', this function's name, in a string
#84: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cs.c:341:
+    pr_notice("ide-cs: ide_config failed memory allocation\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#100: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:353:
+		pr_notice(PFX "%s: The disk reports a capacity of %d "
+			  "bytes, but the drive only handles %d\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
