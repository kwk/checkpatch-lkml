WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 136 exceeds 100 columns
#150: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:873:
+		err_printk(dev, NULL, "DMA-API: device driver maps memory from kernel text or rodata [addr=%p] [len=%lu]\n", addr, len);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
