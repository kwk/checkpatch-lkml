CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#71: FILE: kernel/user_namespace.c:53:
+	tsk->uid = tsk->euid = tsk->suid = tsk->fsuid = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#72: FILE: kernel/user_namespace.c:54:

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#76: FILE: kernel/user_namespace.c:58:
+	 * fork only */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
