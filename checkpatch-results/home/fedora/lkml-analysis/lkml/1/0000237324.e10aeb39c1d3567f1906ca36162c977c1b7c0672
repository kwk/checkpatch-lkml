WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#115: FILE: arch/x86/xen/spinlock.c:100:
+		/* check again make sure it didn't become free while
+		   we weren't looking  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "prev"
#123: FILE: arch/x86/xen/spinlock.c:108:
+			if (prev != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#162: FILE: drivers/xen/events.c:174:
+	struct shared_info *s = HYPERVISOR_shared_info;
+	return sync_test_bit(port, &s->evtchn_pending[0]);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
