WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#65: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/Kconfig:292:
+config USB_SERIAL_KEYSPAN_PDA_FIRMWARE
+	bool "Include Keyspan PDA firmware in kernel"
+	help
+	  This option allows you to build the required firmware for the
+	  Keyspan PDA serial port into the kernel. Say 'N' and let it
+	  get loaded by udev instead.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#150: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/keyspan_pda.c:720:
+	if (0) { ; }

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#150: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/keyspan_pda.c:720:
+	if (0) { ; }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <idVendor>
#154: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/keyspan_pda.c:722:
+	else if (le16_to_cpu(serial->dev->descriptor.idVendor) == KEYSPAN_VENDOR_ID)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
