WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#41: FILE: include/linux/wait.h:180:
+void __wake_up_common(wait_queue_head_t *q, unsigned int mode, int nr_exclusive, int sync, void *key);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line

  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
