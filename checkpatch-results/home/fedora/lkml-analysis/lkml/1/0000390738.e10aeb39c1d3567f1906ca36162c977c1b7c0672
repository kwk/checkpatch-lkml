WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#49: FILE: include/linux/seq_file.h:36:
+int seq_open_private(struct file *, struct seq_operations *, void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#49: FILE: include/linux/seq_file.h:36:
+int seq_open_private(struct file *, struct seq_operations *, void *);

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
