Subject: [PATCH 1/2] MMC Agressive clocking framework v5
                         ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'agressively' may be misspelled - perhaps 'aggressively'?
#64: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/Kconfig:21:
+	  This will attempt to agressively gate the clock to the MMC host,
 	                       ^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'intialization' may be misspelled - perhaps 'initialization'?
#126: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:474:
+	 * The clock may however be 0 during intialization,
 	                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#132: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:480:
+		BUG_ON(host->ios.clock);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0600'.
#167: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/debugfs.c:155:
+	if (!debugfs_create_u32("clk_delay", (S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR),

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#214: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/host.c:71:
+		pr_err("%s: frequency set to 0 in disable function, "
+		       "this means the clock is already disabled.\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
