WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct class_device *' should also have an identifier name
#144: FILE: include/linux/device.h:202:
+	struct dentry *(*class_device_dparent)(struct class_device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#145: FILE: include/linux/device.h:203:
+	void *(*class_follow_link)(struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd);
