CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#241: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/cxgb3_main.c:1834:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#2765: FILE: drivers/net/epic100.c:366:
+	ioaddr = (long) pci_ioremap_bar(pdev, 1);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

+	    || !device_can_wakeup(&hw->pdev->dev))
