Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:ONE_SEMICOLON: Statements terminations use 1 semicolon
#116: FILE: kernel/exit.c:874:
+			list_add(&p->ptrace_entry, &dead_list);;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#122: FILE: kernel/exit.c:879:
+	BUG_ON(!list_empty(&father->ptraced));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
