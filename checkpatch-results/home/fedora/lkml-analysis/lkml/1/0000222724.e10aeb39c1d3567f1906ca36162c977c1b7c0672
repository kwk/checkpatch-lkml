CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/mmc/sdio_func.h:116:
+extern int sdio_claim_hard_irq(struct sdio_func *func,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#95: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/sdio_irq.c:36:
+			struct sdio_func *func = card->sdio_func[i - 1];
+			if (func && func->hard_irq_handler) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
