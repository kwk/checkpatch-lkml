ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#154: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/time.c:981:
+        return (cycle_t)get_cycles();$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

+        return (cycle_t)get_cycles();$

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'caluclated' may be misspelled - perhaps 'calculated'?
#162: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/time.c:989:

 	                             ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
