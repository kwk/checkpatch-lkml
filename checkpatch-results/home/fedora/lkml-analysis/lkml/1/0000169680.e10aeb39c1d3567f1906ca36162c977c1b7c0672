Impact: misc udpate
             ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/percpu.h> instead of <asm/percpu.h>
#53: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/stackprotector.h:8:
+#include <asm/percpu.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
