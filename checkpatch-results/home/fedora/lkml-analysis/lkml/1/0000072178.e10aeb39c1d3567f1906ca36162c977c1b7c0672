WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct backlight_ops should normally be const

+					 struct backlight_ops *ops)

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'backlight_alloc', this function's name, in a string
#77: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/backlight.c:234:
+	pr_debug("backlight_alloc: name=%s\n", name);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
