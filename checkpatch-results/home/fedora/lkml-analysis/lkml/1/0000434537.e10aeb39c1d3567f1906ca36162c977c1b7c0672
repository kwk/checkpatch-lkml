         ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#99: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:107:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "BUG: set_wq_data ");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'set_wq_data', this function's name, in a string
#99: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:107:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "BUG: set_wq_data ");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#100: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:108:
+		print_symbol("%s\n", (unsigned long) work->func);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
