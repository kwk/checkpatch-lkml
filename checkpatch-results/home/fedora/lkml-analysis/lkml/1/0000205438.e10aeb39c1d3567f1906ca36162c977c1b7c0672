                                                ^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#216: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:741:
+		if (RB_WARN_ON(cpu_buffer,
+			  cpu_buffer->commit_page == cpu_buffer->tail_page))

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'iter->head_page == cpu_buffer->commit_page'
#302: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:1710:
+	if (RB_WARN_ON(cpu_buffer,
 		       (iter->head_page == cpu_buffer->commit_page) &&
+		       (iter->head + length > rb_commit_index(cpu_buffer))))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
