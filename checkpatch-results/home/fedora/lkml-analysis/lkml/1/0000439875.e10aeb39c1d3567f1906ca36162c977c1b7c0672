WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 122 exceeds 100 columns
#140: FILE: fs/compat.c:94:
+asmlinkage long compat_sys_utimensat(unsigned int dfd, char __user *filename, struct compat_timespec __user *t, int flags)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

#429: FILE: include/linux/time.h:112:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
