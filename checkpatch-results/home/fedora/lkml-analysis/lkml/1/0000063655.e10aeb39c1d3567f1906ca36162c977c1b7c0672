CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:207:
+extern int lru_add_drain_all_async(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#79: FILE: mm/swap.c:325:
+		struct work_struct *work = &per_cpu(lru_drain_work, cpu);
+		schedule_work_on(cpu, work);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
