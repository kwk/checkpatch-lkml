CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#457: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:112:
+extern int irq_set_affinity(unsigned int irq, const struct cpumask *cpumask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
