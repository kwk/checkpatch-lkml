    ->vfs_dq_claim_space()  /*  acquire dqptr_sem here. Possible deadlock */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#237: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1105:
+		BUG_ON(mdb_free < mdb_claim);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
