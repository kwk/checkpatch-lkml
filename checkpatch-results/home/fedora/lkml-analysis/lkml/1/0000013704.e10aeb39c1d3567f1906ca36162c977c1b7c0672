Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/xsave.h:34:
+extern void update_regset_xstate_info(unsigned int size, u64 xstate_mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#204: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/i387.c:305:
+	xsave_hdr->reserved1[0] = xsave_hdr->reserved1[1] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
