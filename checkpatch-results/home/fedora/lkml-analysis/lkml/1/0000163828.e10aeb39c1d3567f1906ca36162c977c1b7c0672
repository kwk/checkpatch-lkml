#30: 
this patch on top of [PATCH][SMACK] convert smack rule list to linux list V2

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!kp->smk_cipso"
#229: FILE: security/smack/smack_access.c:383:
+	if (found == 0 || kp->smk_cipso == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#241: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:2938:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
