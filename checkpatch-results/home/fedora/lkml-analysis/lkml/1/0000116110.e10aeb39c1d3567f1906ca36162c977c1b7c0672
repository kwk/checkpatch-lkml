+config ACERHDF
+	tristate "Acer Aspire One temperature and fan driver"
+	depends on THERMAL && THERMAL_HWMON
+	---help---
+	  This is a driver for Acer Aspire One netbooks. It allows to access
+	  the temperature sensor and to control the fan.
+
+	  After loading this driver the BIOS is still in control of the fan.
+	  To let the kernel handle the fan, do:
+	  echo -n enabled > /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/mode
+
+	  For more information about this driver see
+	  <http://piie.net/files/acerhdf_README.txt>
+
+	  If you have an Acer Aspire One netbook, say Y or M
+	  here.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
