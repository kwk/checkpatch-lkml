WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'namepsace' may be misspelled - perhaps 'namespace'?
#144: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2216:
+	/* The namepsace those pids belong to */
 	       ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#181: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2256:
+			if (cp->tasks_pids[mid] == pid) {
[...]
-			} else if (cgrp->tasks_pids[mid] <= pid)
[...]
 				index = mid + 1;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#235: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2317:
+	BUG_ON(!cp->pids_use_count);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
