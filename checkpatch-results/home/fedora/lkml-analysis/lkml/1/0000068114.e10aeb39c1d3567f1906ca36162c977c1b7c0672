Inform util/module.c::mod_dso__load_module_paths() that relative paths do exist

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dpath"
#119: FILE: tools/perf/util/module.c:427:
+	if (dpath == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!modfile"
#181: FILE: tools/perf/util/module.c:480:
+		if (modfile == NULL)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#188: FILE: tools/perf/util/module.c:487:
+		tmp = name = strtok(name, "/");

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
