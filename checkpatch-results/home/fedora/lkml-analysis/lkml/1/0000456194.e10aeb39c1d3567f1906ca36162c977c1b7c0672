+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#50: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/account.c:15:
+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#150: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/account.c:115:
+	need = ubi->acc.beb_rsvd_max = ubi->acc.beb_rsvd_pebs;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#245: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/account.c:210:
+		if (ubi->acc.avail_pebs < ubi->acc.beb_rsvd_max) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
