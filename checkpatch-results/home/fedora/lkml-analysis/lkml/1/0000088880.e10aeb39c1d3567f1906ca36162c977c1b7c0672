#42: 
Dead keys (for which the key type has been removed) will be garbage collected

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#141: FILE: security/keys/internal.h:136:
+extern void keyring_gc(struct key *keyring, time_t limit);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*new)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct keyring_list)...)
#245: FILE: security/keys/keyring.c:1035:
+	new = kmalloc(sizeof(struct keyring_list) + max * sizeof(struct key *),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
