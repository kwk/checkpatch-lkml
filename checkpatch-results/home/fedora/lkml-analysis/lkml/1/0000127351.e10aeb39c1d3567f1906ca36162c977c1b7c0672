Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*keypad)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct max7359_keypad)...)
#179: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/max7359_keypad.c:220:
+	keypad = kzalloc(sizeof(struct max7359_keypad), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
