WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#82: FILE: drivers/char/n_tty.c:1015:
+	int canon_change = 1;
+	BUG_ON(!tty);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#82: FILE: drivers/char/n_tty.c:1015:
+	BUG_ON(!tty);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SIZEOF_PARENTHESIS: sizeof tty->read_flags should be sizeof(tty->read_flags)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
