WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#61: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:209:
+^Istruct tty_struct ^I*tty;$

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#96: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:477:
+			outsw(base, port->xmit_buf+port->xmit_tail, word_count);
 			                          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (16, 32)
#124: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:661:
+		while (byte_count > 0) {
 				inw(base);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tty"
#135: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:686:
+	if (tty == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#156: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:724:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#192: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:817:
+		unsigned long page  = get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL);
+		if (page == NULL)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!page"
#192: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:817:
+		if (page == NULL)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#210: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:956:
+		error = block_til_ready(tty, filp, port);
 		                             ^^^^
