#32: 
Allow keys for which the key type has been removed to be unlinked.  Currently

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#55: FILE: security/keys/internal.h:127:
+extern key_ref_t lookup_user_key(key_serial_t id, unsigned long flags,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#316: FILE: security/keys/process_keys.c:646:
+	 * the permission checks as it is only concerned with the keyring */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
