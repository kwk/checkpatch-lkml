WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#34: 
 arch/powerpc/kvm/{booke_guest.c => booke.c} |   60 +++++++++++++++++++

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#59: FILE: arch/powerpc/kvm/Kconfig:33:
+config KVM_BOOKE
+	bool "KVM support for Book E PowerPC processors"
 	depends on KVM && 44x
 	---help---
 	  Provides host support for KVM on Book E PowerPC processors. Currently

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/cacheflush.h> instead of <asm/cacheflush.h>
#93: FILE: arch/powerpc/kvm/booke.c:30:
+#include <asm/cacheflush.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#114: FILE: arch/powerpc/kvm/booke.c:591:
+	 * be 16-bit aligned, so we need a 64KB allocation. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
