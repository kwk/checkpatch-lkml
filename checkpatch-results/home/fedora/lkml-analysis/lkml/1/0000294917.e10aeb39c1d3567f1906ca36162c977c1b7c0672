ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#296: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_sched_switch.c:51:
+static struct tracer_switch_ops sched_switch_ops __read_mostly =

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ops"
#317: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_sched_switch.c:71:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
