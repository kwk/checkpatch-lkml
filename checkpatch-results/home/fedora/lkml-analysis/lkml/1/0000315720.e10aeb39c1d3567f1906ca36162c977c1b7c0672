CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2034:
+extern struct task_group *sched_create_group(struct task_group *parent);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#69: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7159:
+static void init_tg_cfs_entry(struct task_group *tg, struct cfs_rq *cfs_rq,
+				struct sched_entity *se, int cpu, int add,

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!parent"
#81: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7174:
+	if (parent == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#95: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7253:
+		init_tg_cfs_entry(&init_task_group, &rq->cfs,
+							NULL, i, 1, NULL);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#114: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7640:
+static int alloc_fair_sched_group(struct task_group *tg,
+					struct task_group *parent)

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#124: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7668:
+		if (!parent) {
[...]
+		} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
