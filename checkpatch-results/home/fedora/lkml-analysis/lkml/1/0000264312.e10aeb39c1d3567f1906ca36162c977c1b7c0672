CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#138: FILE: mm/hugetlb.c:235:
+#define HPAGE_RESV_OWNER    (1UL << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
