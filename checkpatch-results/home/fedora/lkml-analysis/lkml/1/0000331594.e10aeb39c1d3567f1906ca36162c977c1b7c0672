CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buf"
#80: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:76:
+	if (buf == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buf"

+	if (buf == NULL)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#144: FILE: include/linux/dmi.h:81:
+extern int dmi_walk(void (*decode)(const struct dmi_header *));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
