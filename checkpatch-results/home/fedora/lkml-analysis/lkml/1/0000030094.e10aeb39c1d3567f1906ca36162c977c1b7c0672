ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#66: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/wmi.c:719:
+static bool guid_already_parsed(const char *guid_string) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#75: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/wmi.c:728:
+		if (strncmp(gblock->guid, guid_string, 16) == 0) {
+			return true;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
