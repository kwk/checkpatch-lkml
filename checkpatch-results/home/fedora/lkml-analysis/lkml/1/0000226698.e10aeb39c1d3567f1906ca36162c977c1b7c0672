#35: 
This patch supports migrating pages between bio-cgroups with minimum overhead,

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/biocontrol.h:103:
+extern void bio_cgroup_recharge(struct page *page, struct mm_struct *mm);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
