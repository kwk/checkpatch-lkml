WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'alloced' may be misspelled - perhaps 'allocated'?
#101: FILE: drivers/net/atl1/atl1_main.c:493:
+		rfd_ring->buffer_info[rfd_ring->next_to_clean].alloced = 0;

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#102: FILE: drivers/net/atl1/atl1_main.c:494:
+		if (++rfd_ring->next_to_clean == rfd_ring->count) {
+			rfd_ring->next_to_clean = 0;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
