#41: 
Fixes for pdc202xx_old host driver and for Host Protected Area (HPA) support.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#197: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:401:
+		drive->probed_capacity = drive->capacity64 = 1ULL << 28;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct block_device_operations should normally be const
#391: FILE: fs/partitions/check.c:564:
+			struct block_device_operations *bdops = disk->fops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#432: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:1109:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct gendisk *' should also have an identifier name
#432: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:1109:
+	unsigned long long (*set_capacity) (struct gendisk *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
