*dev, pm_message_t state)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#88: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/acerhdf.c:467:
+static struct dev_pm_ops acerhdf_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
