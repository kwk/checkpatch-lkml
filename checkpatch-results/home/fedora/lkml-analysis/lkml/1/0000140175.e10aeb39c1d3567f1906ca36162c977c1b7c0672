WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Non-standard signature: 'Singed-off-by:' - perhaps 'Signed-off-by:'?
#44: 
Singed-off-by: Mike Waychison <mikew@google.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#115: FILE: arch/arm/mm/fault.c:197:
+	if (fsr & (1 << 11)) { /* write? */
[...]
+		fault_flags |= FAULT_FLAG_WRITE;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
