WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#153: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#158: FILE: kernel/ns_container.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment
#170: FILE: kernel/ns_container.c:13:
+	spinlock_t lock;

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#234: FILE: kernel/ns_container.c:77:
+	if (!ns) return -ENOMEM;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#244: FILE: kernel/ns_container.c:87:
+	struct nscont *ns = container_nscont(cont);
+	kfree(ns);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
