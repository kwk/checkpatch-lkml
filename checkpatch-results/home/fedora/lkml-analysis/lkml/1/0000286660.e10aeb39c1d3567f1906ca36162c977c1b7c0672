WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#114: 
# grep bonus_max `grep -l amarokapp /proc/*/task/*/sched`

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#179: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:665:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#181: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:667:
+				unsigned long bonus;
+				bonus = calc_delta_weight(sysctl_sched_latency, se);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
