WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#67: 
    This removes also the ugly lock drop / unqueue inside of fixup_pi_state()

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#331: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1366:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "futex_lock_pi: ret = %d "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'futex_lock_pi', this function's name, in a string
#331: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1366:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "futex_lock_pi: ret = %d "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#332: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1367:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "futex_lock_pi: ret = %d "
+				       "pi-mutex: %p pi-state %p\n", ret,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
