CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#102: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:182:
+extern int queue_work_on(int cpu, struct workqueue_struct *wq,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#103: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:183:
+extern int queue_work_on(int cpu, struct workqueue_struct *wq,
+			struct work_struct *work);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#111: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:193:
+extern int schedule_work_on(int cpu, struct work_struct *work);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#139: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:194:
+		BUG_ON(!list_empty(&work->entry));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
