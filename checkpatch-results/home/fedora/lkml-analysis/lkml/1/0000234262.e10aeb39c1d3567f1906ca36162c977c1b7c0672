CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*p)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct cdev)...)
#88: FILE: fs/char_dev.c:505:
+	struct cdev *p = kmalloc(sizeof(struct cdev), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct cdev *' should also have an identifier name
#114: FILE: include/linux/cdev.h:19:
+	void (*release)(struct cdev *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
