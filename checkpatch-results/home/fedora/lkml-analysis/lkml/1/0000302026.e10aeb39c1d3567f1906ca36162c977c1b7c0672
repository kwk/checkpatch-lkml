CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p"
#69: FILE: arch/powerpc/sysdev/dcr.c:38:
+		if (p == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
