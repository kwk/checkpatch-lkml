WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#53: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1102:
+	void (*fork) (struct task_struct *p);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2459:
+extern void set_task_cpu_locked(struct task_struct *p, int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#207: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2114:
+       ^Irq = old_rq = task_rq(p);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#207: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2114:
+       ^Irq = old_rq = task_rq(p);$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#207: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2114:
+       ^Irq = old_rq = task_rq(p);$

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#207: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2114:
+       	rq = old_rq = task_rq(p);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:WxV)
#283: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2616:
+	struct *rq;
 	       ^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#371: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:1932:
+	struct sched_entity *se = &p->se, *curr = cfs_rq-curr;
 	                                                ^

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
