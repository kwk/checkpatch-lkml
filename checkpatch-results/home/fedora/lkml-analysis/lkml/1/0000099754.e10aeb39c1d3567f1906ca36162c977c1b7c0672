#29: 
iosignalfd is a mechanism to register PIO/MMIO regions to trigger an eventfd

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'asychronously' may be misspelled - perhaps 'asynchronously'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#125: FILE: include/linux/kvm.h:310:
+#define KVM_IOSIGNALFD_FLAG_TRIGGER   (1 << 0) /* trigger is valid */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#126: FILE: include/linux/kvm.h:311:
+#define KVM_IOSIGNALFD_FLAG_PIO       (1 << 1) /* is a pio (otherwise mmio) */

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#127: FILE: include/linux/kvm.h:312:
+#define KVM_IOSIGNALFD_FLAG_DEASSIGN  (1 << 2)

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#191: FILE: include/linux/kvm_host.h:552:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#285: FILE: virt/kvm/eventfd.c:385:
+	BUG_ON(!IS_ALIGNED((unsigned long)val, len));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#468: FILE: virt/kvm/eventfd.c:568:

+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#485: FILE: virt/kvm/eventfd.c:585:
+	list_for_each_entry_safe(p, tmp, &kvm->iosignalfds, list) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
