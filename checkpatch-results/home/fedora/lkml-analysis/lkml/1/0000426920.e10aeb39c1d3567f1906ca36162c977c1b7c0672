WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#91: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#96: FILE: arch/mips/sgi-ip32/ip32-platform.c:1:
+#include <linux/init.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 118 exceeds 100 columns
#138: FILE: drivers/net/chelsio/suni1x10gexp_regs.h:108:
+#define mSUNI1x10GEXP_REG_RXXG_EXACT_MATCH_VID(filterId)      (0x2062 + mSUNI1x10GEXP_MAC_VID_FILTER_OFFSET(filterId))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#396: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/libertas/decl.h:49:
+void libertas_upload_rx_packet(wlan_private * priv, struct sk_buff *skb);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
