#26: 
Make 'perf stat -e syscalls:sys_enter_blah' work with syscall style tracepoints.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#45: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:737:
+extern void perf_tpcounter_event(int event_id, u64 addr, u64 count,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#211: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_syscalls.c:286:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
