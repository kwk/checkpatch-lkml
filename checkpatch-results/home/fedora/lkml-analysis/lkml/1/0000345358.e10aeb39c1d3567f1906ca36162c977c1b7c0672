CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#107: FILE: include/linux/dmar.h:50:
+extern int intel_iommu_gfx_remapping(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#116: FILE: include/linux/dmar.h:86:
 }
+static inline int intel_iommu_gfx_remapping(void)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
