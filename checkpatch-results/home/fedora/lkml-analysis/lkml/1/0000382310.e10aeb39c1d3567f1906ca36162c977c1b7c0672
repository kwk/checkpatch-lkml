CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:188:
+extern void move_tail_pages(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - void move_tail_pages() should probably be void move_tail_pages(void)
#117: FILE: mm/swap.c:127:
+void move_tail_pages()

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)
