ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#83: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:482:
+	static struct kobject *virtual_dir = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!parent"
#113: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:503:
+		if (parent == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#117: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:507:
+			return &parent->kobj;
+		else

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#210: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:92:
+extern struct kobject *kobject_kset_add_dir(struct kset *kset,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct kobject *' should also have an identifier name
#210: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:92:
+extern struct kobject *kobject_kset_add_dir(struct kset *kset,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const char *' should also have an identifier name
#210: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:92:
+extern struct kobject *kobject_kset_add_dir(struct kset *kset,

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'subsytem' may be misspelled - perhaps 'subsystem'?
