that would result in data loss. The changes are also needed to handle ENOSPC

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1070:
+extern int ext4_page_mkwrite(struct vm_area_struct *vma, struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#102: FILE: fs/ext4/file.c:126:
+static struct vm_operations_struct ext4_file_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
