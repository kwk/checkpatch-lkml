CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#126: FILE: include/asm-x86/e820_64.h:26:
+extern void e820_reserve_resources(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#146: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/e820_64.c:248:
+        insert_resource(&iomem_resource, res);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
