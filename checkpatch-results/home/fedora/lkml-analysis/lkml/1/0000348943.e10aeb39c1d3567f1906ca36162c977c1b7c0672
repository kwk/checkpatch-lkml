CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#148: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:307:
+extern int get_pty(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#172: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/sys-i386/task_size.c:1:
+#include <stdio.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#188: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/sys-i386/task_size.c:17:
+	unsigned long *address = (unsigned long *) (page << UM_KERN_PAGE_SHIFT);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#201: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/sys-i386/task_size.c:30:
+	if (setjmp(buf) == 0)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#203: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/sys-i386/task_size.c:32:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "mapped"
#232: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/sys-i386/task_size.c:61:
+	if (mapped != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
