CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: fs/fat/fat.h:311:
+extern void fat_fs_panic(struct super_block *s, const char *fmt, ...)

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __printf(2, 3) over __attribute__((format(printf, 2, 3)))
#59: FILE: fs/fat/fat.h:312:
+	__attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3))) __cold;
