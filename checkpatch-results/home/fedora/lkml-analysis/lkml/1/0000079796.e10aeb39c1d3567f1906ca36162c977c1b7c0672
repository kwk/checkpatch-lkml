WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#49: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#55: FILE: arch/score/Makefile:2:
+# arch/score/Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'apropriate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'appropriate'?
#95: FILE: arch/score/Makefile:42:
+	echo '  These will be default as apropriate for a configured platform.'
 	                                 ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
