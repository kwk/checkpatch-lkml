#33: 
This works on real hw, but not on qemu. It seems to get stuck waiting for one

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/smp.h> instead of <asm/smp.h>
#93: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kmemcheck.c:27:
+#include <asm/smp.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#112: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kmemcheck.c:253:
+static int nmi_notifier(struct notifier_block *self,
+	unsigned long val, void *data)

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#114: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kmemcheck.c:255:
+	struct die_args *args = (struct die_args *) data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#197: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kmemcheck.c:331:
+	BUG_ON(err);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
