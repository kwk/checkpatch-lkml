Here is the patch for your review. The same approach can apply to non-mergable

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#65: FILE: drivers/net/virtio_net.c:17:
  * Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#77: FILE: drivers/net/virtio_net.c:44:
+struct page_list
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*plist)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct page_list)...)
#103: FILE: drivers/net/virtio_net.c:123:
+		plist = kmalloc(sizeof(struct page_list), gfp_mask);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#225: FILE: drivers/net/virtio_net.c:235:
+^I^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#267: FILE: drivers/net/virtio_net.c:386:
+		struct page_list *plist = get_a_free_page(vi, GFP_ATOMIC);
+		if (!plist || !plist->page)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#346: FILE: drivers/net/virtio_net.c:1014:
+		BUG_ON(vi->num != 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
