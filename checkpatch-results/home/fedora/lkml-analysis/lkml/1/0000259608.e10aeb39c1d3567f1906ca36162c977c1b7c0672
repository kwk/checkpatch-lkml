WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#87: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:773:
+	printk("ide_probe_port(%s) noprobe=%d,%d\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ide_probe_port', this function's name, in a string
#87: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:773:
+	printk("ide_probe_port(%s) noprobe=%d,%d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'MB_CD != bay->content_id'
#151: FILE: drivers/macintosh/mediabay.c:452:
+			if ((MB_CD != bay->content_id) || bay->state != mb_wait_ide_init) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#151: FILE: drivers/macintosh/mediabay.c:452:
+			if ((MB_CD != bay->content_id) || bay->state != mb_wait_ide_init) {

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.
