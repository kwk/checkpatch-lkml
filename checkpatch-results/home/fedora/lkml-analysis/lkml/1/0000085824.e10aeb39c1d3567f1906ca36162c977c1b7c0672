Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#85: FILE: include/linux/syscalls.h:124:
+			return -ENOSYS;					\

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
