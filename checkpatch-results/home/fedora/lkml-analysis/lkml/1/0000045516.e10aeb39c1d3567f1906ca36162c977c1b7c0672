WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#152: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#157: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-kmem.c:1:
+#include "builtin.h"

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!thread"
#231: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-kmem.c:75:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#432: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-kmem.c:276:

+			"without -R?");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#466: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-kmem.c:310:
+	printf("\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around root->rb_node
#523: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-kmem.c:367:
+	struct rb_node **new = &(root->rb_node);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#583: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-kmem.c:427:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#743: FILE: tools/perf/builtin.h:31:
+extern int cmd_kmem(int argc, const char **argv, const char *prefix);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
