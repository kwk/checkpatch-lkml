WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#215: FILE: kernel/time/ntp.c:407:
+	ntp_tick_adj = simple_strtol(str, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
