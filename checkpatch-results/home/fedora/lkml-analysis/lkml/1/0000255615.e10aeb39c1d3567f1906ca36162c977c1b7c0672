> And Dmitry, _please_ also explain what was going on. Why did things break 

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:820:
+extern void detach_sched_domains(int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#134: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7318:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
