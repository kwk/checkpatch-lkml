Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#61: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c:57:
+			DBG(host, "MMCI: divide cclk to %u Hz (divide %u by %u)\n", host->cclk, host->mclk, clk);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
