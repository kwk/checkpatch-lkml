Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!shost->free_list.next"
#108: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi.c:484:
+	if (shost->free_list.next == NULL && shost->free_list.prev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!shost->free_list.prev"
#108: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi.c:484:
+	if (shost->free_list.next == NULL && shost->free_list.prev == NULL)
