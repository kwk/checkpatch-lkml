WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#40: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .2
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'q->next_ordered == QUEUE_ORDERED_NONE'
#323: FILE: block/blk-core.c:1161:
+	if (bio_barrier(bio) && bio_has_data(bio) &&
+	    (q->next_ordered == QUEUE_ORDERED_NONE)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mddev->pers"
#368: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:3592:
+	if (mddev->pers == NULL ||

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mddev->pers->quiesce"
#369: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:3593:
+	    mddev->pers->quiesce == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mddev->pers"
#378: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:3621:
+	if (mddev->pers == NULL ||

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mddev->pers->quiesce"
#379: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:3622:
+	    mddev->pers->quiesce == NULL)

CHECK:INVALID_UTF8: Invalid UTF-8, patch and commit message should be encoded in UTF-8

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#446: FILE: drivers/pci/iova.c:14:
+ * this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#461: FILE: drivers/pci/iova.c:139:
+		/* If we have 'prev', it's a valid place to start the
+		   insertion. Otherwise, start from the root. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
