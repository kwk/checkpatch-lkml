####TESTCASE_BEGIN

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#93: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2089:
+	BUG_ON(!S_ISBLK(inode->i_mode) &&

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#94: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2090:
+	BUG_ON(!S_ISBLK(inode->i_mode) &&
+			!mutex_is_locked(&inode->i_mutex));

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#109: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2132:
+			loff_t isize = i_size_read(inode);
+			if (pos + count > isize)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
