The attached would be my preffered approach to this.
                         ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#156: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-pca-isa.c:110:
+static int __devinit pca_isa_match(struct device *dev, unsigned int id)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#160: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-pca-isa.c:114:
+	if (match) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
