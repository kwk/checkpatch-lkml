#1. Define 3 bits(18,19,20) in Transmit Descriptor 1

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)

#131: FILE: drivers/net/via-rhine.c:1276:
+           (skb->ip_summed == CHECKSUM_PARTIAL)) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
