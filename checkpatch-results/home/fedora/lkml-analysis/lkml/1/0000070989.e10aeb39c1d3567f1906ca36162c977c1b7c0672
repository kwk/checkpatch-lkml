ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#172: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:4762:
+         * the in-core orphan list manually.$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#182: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:4772:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
