WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#49: FILE: drivers/power/power_supply_core.c:97:
+		if (psy->get_property(psy,
+				       POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_ONLINE, &ret))

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - int power_supply_is_system_supplied() should probably be int power_supply_is_system_supplied(void)
#57: FILE: drivers/power/power_supply_core.c:105:
+int power_supply_is_system_supplied()

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#92: FILE: include/linux/power_supply.h:172:
+extern int power_supply_is_system_supplied(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#94: FILE: include/linux/power_supply.h:174:
+static int power_supply_is_system_supplied(void) { return -ENOSYS; }

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
