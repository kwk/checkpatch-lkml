WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#213: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:904:
+	if (create) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#326: FILE: include/linux/ext4_fs.h:1110:
+extern int ext4_get_blocks_wrap(handle_t *handle, struct inode *inode,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
