CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <NeedsValidate>
#116: FILE: fs/ocfs2/buffer_head_io.c:53:
+BUFFER_FNS(NeedsValidate, needs_validate);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#149: FILE: fs/ocfs2/buffer_head_io.c:352:
+				 * that better not have changed */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#150: FILE: fs/ocfs2/buffer_head_io.c:353:
+				BUG_ON(buffer_jbd(bh));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#369: FILE: fs/ocfs2/suballoc.c:187:
+		do_error("Group descriptor #%llu has bit count %u but "
+			 "claims that %u are free",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#378: FILE: fs/ocfs2/suballoc.c:196:
+		do_error("Group descriptor #%llu has bit count %u but "
+			 "max bitmap bits of %u",

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#555: FILE: fs/ocfs2/xattr.c:2840:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
