WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#17: 
Subject: [PATCH] acpi: sparse fix, replace macro with static function

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#72: FILE: drivers/acpi/utils.c:45:
+	struct acpi_buffer buffer = {sizeof(prefix), prefix};
+	acpi_get_name(h, ACPI_FULL_PATHNAME, &buffer);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#74: FILE: drivers/acpi/utils.c:47:
+	ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT((ACPI_DB_INFO, "Evaluate [%s.%s]: %s\n",
+		(char *) prefix, p, acpi_format_exception(s)));

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#74: FILE: drivers/acpi/utils.c:47:
+		(char *) prefix, p, acpi_format_exception(s)));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
