Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'sie' may be misspelled - perhaps 'size'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#537: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/kvm_ppc.h:60:
+extern int kvmppc_emulate_mmio(struct kvm_run *run, struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#574: FILE: virt/kvm/ioapic.c:93:
+		int injected = ioapic_deliver(ioapic, idx);
+		if (injected && pent->fields.trig_mode == IOAPIC_LEVEL_TRIG)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
