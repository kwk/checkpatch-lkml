#32: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/13/58 (thanks to Jim Keniston and Srinivasa for their review comments). This provides support to add an optional user defined callback to be run at function entry of a kretprobe'd function. It also modifies the kprobe smoke tests to include an entry-handler during the kretprobe sanity test.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*inst)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct kretprobe_instance)...)
#224: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:754:
+		inst = kmalloc(sizeof(struct kretprobe_instance) +

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#251: FILE: kernel/test_kprobes.c:155:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "Kprobe smoke test failed: "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#252: FILE: kernel/test_kprobes.c:156:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "Kprobe smoke test failed: "
+				"call to kretprobe entry handler failed\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
