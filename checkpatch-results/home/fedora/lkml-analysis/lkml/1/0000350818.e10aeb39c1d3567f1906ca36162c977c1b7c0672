WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+		int onstack = sas_ss_flags(esp);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#67: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/signal_32.c:301:
+		if (onstack == 0)
[...]
+		else if(onstack == SS_ONSTACK){
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
