#33: 
The rdev_for_each_list defined in <linux/raid/md_k.h> is really a reinvented

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#105: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:310:
+	mdk_rdev_t * rdev, *tmp;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
