CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#166: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/svcauth.h:130:
+extern int svcauth_unix_set_client(struct svc_rqst *rqstp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#178: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/svc.h:252:
+	struct auth_domain *	rq_gssclient;	/* "gss/"-style peer info */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
