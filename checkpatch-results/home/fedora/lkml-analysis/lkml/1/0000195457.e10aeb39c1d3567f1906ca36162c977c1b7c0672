ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#61: FILE: net/socket.c:179:
+void net_printk(char *level, char *fmt, ...) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#63: FILE: net/socket.c:181:
+	va_list	ap;
+	va_start(ap, fmt);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#65: FILE: net/socket.c:183:
+	printk("%sNET: %v\n", level, fmt, ap);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'sock_release', this function's name, in a string
#77: FILE: net/socket.c:551:
+		net_printk(KERN_ERR, "sock_release: fasync list not empty!");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'sock_close', this function's name, in a string
