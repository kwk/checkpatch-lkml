CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#78: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1406:
+		ret = tsk->exit_signal = -1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
