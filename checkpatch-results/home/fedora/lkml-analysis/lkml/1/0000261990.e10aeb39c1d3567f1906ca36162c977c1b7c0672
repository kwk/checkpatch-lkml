WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#66: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_mc_sysfs.c:55:
+	ret = strict_strtol(val, 0, &l);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
