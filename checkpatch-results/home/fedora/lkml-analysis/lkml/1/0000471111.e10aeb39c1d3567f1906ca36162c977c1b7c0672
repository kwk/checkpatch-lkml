WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#93: FILE: fs/gfs2/glock.c:1359:
+	BUG_ON(gh_a->gh_gl->gl_ops->go_type == gh_b->gh_gl->gl_ops->go_type);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
