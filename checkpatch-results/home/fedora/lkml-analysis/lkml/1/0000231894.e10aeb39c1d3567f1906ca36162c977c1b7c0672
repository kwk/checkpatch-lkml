CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*de)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct dir_entry)...)
#73: FILE: init/initramfs.c:97:
+	struct dir_entry *de = kmalloc(sizeof(struct dir_entry), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#74: FILE: init/initramfs.c:98:
+	struct dir_entry *de = kmalloc(sizeof(struct dir_entry), GFP_KERNEL);
+	if (!de)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:OOM_MESSAGE: Possible unnecessary 'out of memory' message
#75: FILE: init/initramfs.c:99:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after mtime
#93: FILE: init/initramfs.c:117:
+static __initdata time_t mtime;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
