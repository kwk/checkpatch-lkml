 - When I-cache misses, I-cache will access just the lower layer cache(memory).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#156: FILE: include/asm-ia64/pgtable.h:491:
+extern void __sync_icache_dcache(pte_t pte);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#312: FILE: arch/ia64/mm/init.c:62:
+	BUG_ON(!pte_exec(pte));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
