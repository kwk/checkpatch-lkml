CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "new_page"
#65: FILE: drivers/serial/icom.c:507:
+	if (new_page != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#101: FILE: drivers/serial/icom.c:1520:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
