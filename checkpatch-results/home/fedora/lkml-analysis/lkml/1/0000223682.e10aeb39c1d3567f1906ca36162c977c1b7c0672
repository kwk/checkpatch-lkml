Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#112: FILE: fs/notify/info_user.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#127: FILE: fs/notify/info_user.c:16:
+ *  the Free Software Foundation, 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#155: FILE: fs/notify/info_user.c:44:
+	BUG_ON(!group);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#171: FILE: fs/notify/info_user.c:60:
+static struct file_operations info_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#189: FILE: fs/notify/info_user.c:78:
+	info_file = securityfs_create_file("info", S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR, group->subdir, group, &info_fops);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#189: FILE: fs/notify/info_user.c:78:
+	info_file = securityfs_create_file("info", S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR, group->subdir, group, &info_fops);
 	                                                  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0600'.
#189: FILE: fs/notify/info_user.c:78:
+	info_file = securityfs_create_file("info", S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR, group->subdir, group, &info_fops);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
