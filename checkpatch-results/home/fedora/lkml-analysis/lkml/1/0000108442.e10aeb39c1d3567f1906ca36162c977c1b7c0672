Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#174: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-report.c:652:
+static int sort__has_call = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#192: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-report.c:688:
+			int ret = regcomp(&call_regex, call, REG_EXTENDED);
+			if (ret) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "map"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
