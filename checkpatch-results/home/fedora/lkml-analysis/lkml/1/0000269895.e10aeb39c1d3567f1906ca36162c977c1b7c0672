#27: 
o Use $(hdr-inst)= ... to make Make invocations simpler

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#61: FILE: Makefile:1007:
+hdr-inst := -rR -f $(srctree)/scripts/Makefile.headersinst obj

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
