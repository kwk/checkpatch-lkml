WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#175: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#377: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c:3264:
+	bool uninitialized_var(gmode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'gmode' should also have an identifier name
#377: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c:3264:
+	bool uninitialized_var(gmode);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'up_dev' should also have an identifier name
#390: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43legacy/main.c:2468:
+	struct b43legacy_wldev *uninitialized_var(up_dev);

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#460: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco/orinoco.c:1620:
+	 * case just abort. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
