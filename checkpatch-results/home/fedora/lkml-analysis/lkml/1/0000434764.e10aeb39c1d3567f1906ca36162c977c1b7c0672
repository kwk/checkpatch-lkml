This patch introduces a new flag, I_SYNC and seperates out all sync()

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#125: 
--- a/fs/fs-writeback.c

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#162: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:170:
+	BUG_ON(inode->i_state & I_SYNC);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_ALL'
#195: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:262:
+	if ((wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_ALL) && (inode->i_state & I_SYNC)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#255: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1188:
+#define I_SYNC			(1 << __I_SYNC) /* Currently being synced */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#266: FILE: include/linux/writeback.h:80:
 }
+static inline void inode_sync_wait(struct inode *inode)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#270: FILE: include/linux/writeback.h:84:
+	wait_on_bit(&inode->i_state, __I_SYNC, inode_wait,
+							TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
