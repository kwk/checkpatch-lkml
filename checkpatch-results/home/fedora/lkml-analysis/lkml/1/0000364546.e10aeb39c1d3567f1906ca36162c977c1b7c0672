#30: 
This new routine requires filesystems to implement bmap64 if they want to support > 2^31 blocks in a logical file.  We do this to give time for filesystems to be properly audited.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct address_space *' should also have an identifier name
#47: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:47:
+	sector_t (*bmap)(struct address_space *, sector_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'sector_t' should also have an identifier name
#47: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:47:
+	sector_t (*bmap)(struct address_space *, sector_t);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#59: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:58:
+		 * 64bit and the filesystem has only been audited for 32bit. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#79: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:117:
+			if ((error = get_user(block, p)) != 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
