ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#73: 
--- a/fs/proc/base.c~oom-fix-oom_adjust_write-input-sanity-check-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#81: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1036:
+	oom_adjust = simple_strtol(strstrip(buffer), &end, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
