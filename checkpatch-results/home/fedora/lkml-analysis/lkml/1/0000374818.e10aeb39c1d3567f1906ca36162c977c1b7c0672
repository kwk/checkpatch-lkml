Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ace_setup', this function's name, in a string
#60: FILE: drivers/block/xsysace.c:939:

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as

"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#76: FILE: drivers/block/xsysace.c:1122:
 static int __devinit ace_probe(struct platform_device *dev)
