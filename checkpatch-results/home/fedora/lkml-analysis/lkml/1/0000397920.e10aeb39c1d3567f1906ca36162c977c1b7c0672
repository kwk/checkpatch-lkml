#30: 
Is this a bug? In original verison memset cleared sizeof(state) bytes
                           ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#31: 
instead of sizeof(*state). If it was intentional then this patch is invalid.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*state)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct icside_state)...)
#48: FILE: drivers/ide/arm/icside.c:685:
+	state = kzalloc(sizeof(struct icside_state), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
