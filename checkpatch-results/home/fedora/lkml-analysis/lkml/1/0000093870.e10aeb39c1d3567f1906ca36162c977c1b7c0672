CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!file"
#162: FILE: tools/perf/perf.c:406:
+	if (file == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#348: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.h:21:
+extern int valid_debugfs_mount(const char *debugfs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
