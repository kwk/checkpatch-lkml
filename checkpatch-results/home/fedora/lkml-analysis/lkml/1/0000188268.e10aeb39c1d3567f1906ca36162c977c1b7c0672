CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#44: FILE: include/linux/audit.h:451:
+extern void __audit_mq_open(int oflag, mode_t mode, struct mq_attr *attr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#53: FILE: include/linux/audit.h:472:
 }
+static inline void audit_mq_open(int oflag, mode_t mode, struct mq_attr *attr)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
