CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#152: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:2622:
+			update_p = update_q = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <R5_Wantwrite>
#188: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:2633:
+		set_bit(R5_Wantwrite, &dev->flags);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
