#53: 
Rework the FIFO logic so that we disable the FIFO then selectively re-enable

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#113: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_amd.c:186:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#166: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_amd.c:449:
+	/* Disable the FIFO, the FIFO logic will re-enable it as
+	   appropriate */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
