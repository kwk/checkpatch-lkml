CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Qdisc>
#99: FILE: net/sched/sch_api.c:575:
+	struct Qdisc *oqdisc = dev_queue->qdisc_sleeping;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!qdisc"
#142: FILE: net/sched/sch_api.c:586:
+	if (qdisc == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
