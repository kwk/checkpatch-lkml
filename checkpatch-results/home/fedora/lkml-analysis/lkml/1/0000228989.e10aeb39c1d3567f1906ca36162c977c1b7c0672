WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#77: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/traps_32.c:1241:
+		BUG_ON(ret == false);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BOOL_COMPARISON: Using comparison to false is error prone
#77: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/traps_32.c:1241:
+		BUG_ON(ret == false);

Comparisons of A to true and false are better written
as A and !A.
