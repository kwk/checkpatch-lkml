WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#198: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_hpt37x.c:849:
+	if (PCI_FUNC(pdev->devfn) & 1) {
[...]
+	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pdev_0"
#201: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_hpt37x.c:852:
+		if (pdev_0 == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#207: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_hpt37x.c:858:
+	}
+	else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#239: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_hpt37x.c:1067:
+	   from FN 0 on the HPT374 */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
