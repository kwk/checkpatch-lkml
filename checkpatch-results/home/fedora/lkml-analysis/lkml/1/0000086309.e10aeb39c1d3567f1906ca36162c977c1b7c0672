WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#88: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#93: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-wm831x.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#119: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-wm831x.c:27:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:MSLEEP: msleep < 20ms can sleep for up to 20ms; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#276: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-wm831x.c:184:
+		msleep(1);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!wm831x_rtc"
#527: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-wm831x.c:435:
+	if (wm831x_rtc == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devexit is unnecessary
#581: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-wm831x.c:489:
+static int __devexit wm831x_rtc_remove(struct platform_device *pdev)

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#595: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-wm831x.c:503:
+static struct dev_pm_ops wm831x_rtc_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
