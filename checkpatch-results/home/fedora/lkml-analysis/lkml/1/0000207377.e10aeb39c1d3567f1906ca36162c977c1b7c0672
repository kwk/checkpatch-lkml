CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <deviceID>
#58: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_pci.c:748:
+	unsigned long deviceID;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p"
#67: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_pci.c:757:
+	if (p == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
