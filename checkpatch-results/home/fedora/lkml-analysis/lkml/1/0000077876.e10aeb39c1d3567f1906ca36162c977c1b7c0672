ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#145: FILE: arch/sparc/include/asm/spinlock_64.h:95:
+static void inline arch_read_lock(raw_rwlock_t *lock)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
