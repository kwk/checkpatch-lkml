Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:30:
+extern int  cgroup_fork(struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#243: FILE: kernel/cgroup_task.c:56:
+	if ((max_tasks > INT_MAX) ||
+	    (max_tasks < INT_MIN))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'max_tasks < INT_MIN'
#243: FILE: kernel/cgroup_task.c:56:

+	    (max_tasks < INT_MIN))

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*taskcg)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct task_cgroup)...)
#299: FILE: kernel/cgroup_task.c:112:
+	taskcg = kzalloc(sizeof(struct task_cgroup), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
