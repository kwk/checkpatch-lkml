CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/hpet.h:72:
+extern unsigned int hpet_readl(unsigned int a);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#147: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/hpet.c:326:
+		cmp = now + (unsigned int) delta;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
