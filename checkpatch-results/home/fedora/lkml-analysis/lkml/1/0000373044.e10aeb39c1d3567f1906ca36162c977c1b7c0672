Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#246: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:303:
+	rcu_preempt_tasks = kzalloc(nrealpreempthogs * sizeof(rcu_preempt_tasks[0]),
+				GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rcu_preempt_tasks"
#248: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:305:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#280: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:328:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#298: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:871:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#298: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:871:
 		"--- %s: nreaders=%d nfakewriters=%d "
+	        "npreempthogs=%d "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

#333: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:1030:
+		fakewriter_tasks[i] = kthread_run(rcu_torture_fakewriter, (void*)i,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
