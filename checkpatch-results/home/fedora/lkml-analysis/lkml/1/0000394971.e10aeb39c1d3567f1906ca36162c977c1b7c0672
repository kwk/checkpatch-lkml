(cherry picked from commit f885969196da6ae905162c0d1c5f0553de12cb40)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#86: FILE: drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-streams.c:450:
+	/* Big serialization lock to ensure no two streams are started
+	   simultaneously: that can give all sorts of weird results. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#155: FILE: drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-streams.c:856:
+		ivtv_vapi(itv, CX2341X_ENC_SET_EVENT_NOTIFICATION, 4, 0, 0, IVTV_IRQ_ENC_VIM_RST, -1);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
