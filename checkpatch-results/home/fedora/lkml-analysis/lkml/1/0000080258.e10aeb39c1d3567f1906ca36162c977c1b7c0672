WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'wakup' may be misspelled - perhaps 'wakeup'?
#41: 
wait_queue wakup, which can be O(n), so defer all wakeups to the softirq
           ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:709:
+extern void perf_counter_do_pending_softirq(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#129: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:2433:
+^I^I^I         void (*func)(struct perf_pending_entry *))$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#148: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:2449:
+       $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
