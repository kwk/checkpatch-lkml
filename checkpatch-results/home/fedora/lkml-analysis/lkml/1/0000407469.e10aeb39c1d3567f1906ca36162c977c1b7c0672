ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo			* bar" should be "foo			*bar"
#109: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:56:
+	char			* page;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#110: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:57:
+	struct sysfs_ops	* ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
