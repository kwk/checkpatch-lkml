#49: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/atomic_32.h:9:
+#include <asm/bug.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
