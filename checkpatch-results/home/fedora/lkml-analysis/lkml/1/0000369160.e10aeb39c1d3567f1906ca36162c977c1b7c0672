Subject: [PATCH try #4] Input/Joystick Driver: add support AD7142 joystick driver

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#78: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/Kconfig:285:
+config JOYSTICK_AD7142
+	tristate "Analog Devices AD7142 Joystick support"

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
