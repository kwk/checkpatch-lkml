In commit 5a6fe1259506 an extra parameter was added to hugetlb_file_setup(),

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#52: FILE: include/linux/hugetlb.h:163:
+#define set_file_hugepages(file)		BUG()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#53: FILE: include/linux/hugetlb.h:164:
+#define hugetlb_file_setup(name,size,int)	ERR_PTR(-ENOSYS)

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
