ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#147: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_hpc.c:615:
+	static int nr_power_faults = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#157: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_hpc.c:670:
+		u16 reg16;
+		pciehp_readw(ctrl, PCI_EXP_SLTCTL, &reg16);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
