WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: include/linux/stacktrace.h:12:
+extern void save_stack_address(struct stack_trace *trace, unsigned long addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'couldnt' may be misspelled - perhaps 'couldn't'?
#92: FILE: kernel/latency_trace.c:2063:
+			 * If we couldnt get our trace, the first entry will
 			         ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'trace->nr_entries == 1'
#96: FILE: kernel/latency_trace.c:2067:
+			if ((trace->nr_entries == 1)
+			    && (trace->entries[0] == ULONG_MAX)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'trace->entries[0] == ULONG_MAX'
#96: FILE: kernel/latency_trace.c:2067:
+			if ((trace->nr_entries == 1)
+			    && (trace->entries[0] == ULONG_MAX)) {

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#97: FILE: kernel/latency_trace.c:2068:
+			if ((trace->nr_entries == 1)
+			    && (trace->entries[0] == ULONG_MAX)) {
