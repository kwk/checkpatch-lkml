WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 133 exceeds 100 columns
#85: FILE: drivers/staging/android/lowmemorykiller.c:75:
+		lowmem_print(3, "lowmem_shrink %d, %x, ofree %d %d, ma %d\n", nr_to_scan, gfp_mask, other_free, other_file, min_adj);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'lowmem_shrink', this function's name, in a string
#85: FILE: drivers/staging/android/lowmemorykiller.c:75:
+		lowmem_print(3, "lowmem_shrink %d, %x, ofree %d %d, ma %d\n", nr_to_scan, gfp_mask, other_free, other_file, min_adj);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
