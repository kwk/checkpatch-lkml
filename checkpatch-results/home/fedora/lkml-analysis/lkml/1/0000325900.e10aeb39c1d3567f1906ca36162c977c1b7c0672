#31: 
* arch/um/os-Linux/mem.c (make_tempfile): Don't deref NULL upon failed malloc.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tempname"
#66: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/mem.c:173:
+	if (tempname == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'tempdir == NULL'
#70: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/mem.c:177:
+	if ((tempdir == NULL) || (strlen(tempdir) >= MAXPATHLEN))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tempdir"
#70: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/mem.c:177:
+	if ((tempdir == NULL) || (strlen(tempdir) >= MAXPATHLEN))

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#81: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/mem.c:197:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
