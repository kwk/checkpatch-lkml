CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dslot)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dummy_slot)...)
#127: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/fakephp.c:116:
+	dslot = kzalloc(sizeof(struct dummy_slot), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
