WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#80: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma.c:78:
+	BUG_ON(type < DMA_OPS_TYPE_PV || type >= DMA_OPS_TYPE_MAX);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#111: FILE: include/asm-x86/dma-mapping.h:83:
+extern void x86_register_dma_ops(struct dma_mapping_ops *ops,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
