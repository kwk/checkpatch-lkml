Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#158: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/early-quirks.c:48:
+	if (!addr) {
+		return;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
