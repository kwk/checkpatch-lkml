CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "m"

+	for (m = mnt->mnt_master; m != NULL; m = m->mnt_master) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#109: FILE: fs/pnode.c:113:
+		struct vfsmount *d = get_peer_in_ns(m, mnt->mnt_ns);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct vfsmount *' should also have an identifier name
#130: FILE: fs/pnode.h:36:
+int get_dominator_id_same_ns(struct vfsmount *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
