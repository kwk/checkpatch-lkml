non-pinned scheduling. Instead we interate through two distinct lists.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*child_ctx)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct perf_event_context)...)
#354: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:5162:
+		child_ctx = kzalloc(sizeof(struct perf_event_context),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#374: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:5181:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
