CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#261: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/asus-laptop.c:689:
+			asus->ledd_status = (u32) value;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*asus)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct asus_laptop)...)
#558: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/asus-laptop.c:1411:
+	asus = kzalloc(sizeof(struct asus_laptop), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
