CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#172: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1274:
+extern void sched_privileged_task(struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#219: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3333:
+	sysctl_sched_privileged_nice_level = simple_strtol(str, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#222: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3336:
+__setup("privileged_nice_level=", privileged_nice_level_setup);

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#249: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3363:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(sched_privileged_task);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
