CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#118: FILE: drivers/spi/atmel_spi.c:132:
+				spi_writel(as, CSR0 + 4 * i,

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*asd)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct atmel_spi_device)...)
#168: FILE: drivers/spi/atmel_spi.c:622:
+		asd = kzalloc(sizeof(struct atmel_spi_device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
