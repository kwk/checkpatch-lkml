WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#158: FILE: fs/ext4/extents.c:1235:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
