WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#64: FILE: arch/sh/cchips/hd6446x/hd64461.c:119:
+			if (hd64461_demux[i].func != NULL) {
 				irq = hd64461_demux[i].func(irq, hd64461_demux[i].dev);
 			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
