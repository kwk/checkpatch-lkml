CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#57: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-picolcd.c:844:
+	data->lcd_power = data->backlight->props.power = bl_power;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#66: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-picolcd.c:853:
+	int ret;
+	ret = picolcd_set_brightness(data->backlight);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#78: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-picolcd.c:865:
+	int ret;
+	ret = picolcd_reset(hdev);
