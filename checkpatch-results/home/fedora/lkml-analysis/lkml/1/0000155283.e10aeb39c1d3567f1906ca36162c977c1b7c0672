#90: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/ftrace.c:460:
+extern unsigned long __stop_syscalls_metadata[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
