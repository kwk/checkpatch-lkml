#35: 
This patch converts the m68k architecture to use the generic read_persistent_clock and update_persistent_clock interfaces, reducing the amount of arch specific code we have to maintain, and allowing for further cleanups in the future.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#70: FILE: arch/m68k/kernel/time.c:88:
+		ts->tv_sec = mktime(time.tm_year, time.tm_mon, time.tm_mday,
 				      time.tm_hour, time.tm_min, time.tm_sec);
