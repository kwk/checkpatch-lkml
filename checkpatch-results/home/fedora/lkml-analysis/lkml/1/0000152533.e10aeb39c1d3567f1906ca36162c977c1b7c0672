Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#81: FILE: fs/buffer.c:764:
+static void __set_page_dirty(struct page *page,
 		struct address_space *mapping, int warn)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#131: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1263:
+		struct page *page = bh->b_page;
+		if (!TestSetPageDirty(page))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
