Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#128: FILE: drivers/char/mxser.c:1019:
+		}
+		else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
