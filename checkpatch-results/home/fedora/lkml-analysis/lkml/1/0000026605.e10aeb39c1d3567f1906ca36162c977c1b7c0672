#106: FILE: kernel/resource.c:309:
+int __attribute__((weak)) page_is_ram(unsigned long pagenr)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#124: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:191:
+extern int page_is_ram(unsigned long pagenr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
