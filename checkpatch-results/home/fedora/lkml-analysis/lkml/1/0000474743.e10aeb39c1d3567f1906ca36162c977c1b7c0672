WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#113: FILE: drivers/base/power/suspend.c:82:
+	if (!error && dev->bus && dev->bus->suspend && !dev->power.power_state.event && !power_filter(dev)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#125: FILE: include/linux/resume-trace.h:12:
+extern int power_filter(struct device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#172: FILE: kernel/power/main.c:325:

                                        ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#185: FILE: kernel/power/main.c:338:
+static ssize_t filter_show(struct subsystem * subsys, char * buf)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
