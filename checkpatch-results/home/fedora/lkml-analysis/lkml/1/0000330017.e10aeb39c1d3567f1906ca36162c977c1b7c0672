#32: 
This patch adds a new IPC_SETID command to the System V IPCs set of commands,

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#117: FILE: ipc/msg.c:333:
+	/* msg_chid_nolock may return -EAGAIN if there is no more free idr
+	   entry, just go and retry by filling again de idr cache */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
