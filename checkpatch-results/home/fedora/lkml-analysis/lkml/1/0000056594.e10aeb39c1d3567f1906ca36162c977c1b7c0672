CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#61: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/swiotlb.h:12:
+extern void pci_swiotlb_alloc(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#126: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-swiotlb.c:69:
+	if (iommu_detected && !dma_ops) {
[...]
-	}
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
