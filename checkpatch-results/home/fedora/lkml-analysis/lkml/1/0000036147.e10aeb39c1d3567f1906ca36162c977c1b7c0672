CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#78: FILE: drivers/scsi/hosts.c:195:
+int scsi_add_host_with_dma(struct Scsi_Host *shost, struct device *dev,

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#163: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_host.h:729:
+extern int __must_check scsi_add_host_with_dma(struct Scsi_Host *,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct Scsi_Host *' should also have an identifier name
#163: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_host.h:729:
+extern int __must_check scsi_add_host_with_dma(struct Scsi_Host *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct device *' should also have an identifier name
