Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#277: FILE: include/linux/namei.h:94:
+extern int lookup_create(struct nameidata *, int, struct path *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
