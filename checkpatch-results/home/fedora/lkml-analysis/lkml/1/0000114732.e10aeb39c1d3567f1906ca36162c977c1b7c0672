generic_sync_sb_inodes() shall not try to step in and create possible races:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#99: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:521:
+		BUG_ON(inode->i_state & (I_FREEING | I_CLEAR));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
