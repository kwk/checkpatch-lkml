   was a public interface and slighly confusing.  Give it a proper

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#141: FILE: block/blk-core.c:1908:
+		req->nr_sectors = req->hard_nr_sectors = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#322: FILE: block/blk-core.c:1989:
+	if (!locked) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#394: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:834:
+extern bool blk_update_request(struct request *rq, int error,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
