WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#62: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#1164: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/Kconfig:463:
+config MACH_XCEP
+	bool "Iskratel Electronics XCEP"
+	select PXA25x
+	select MTD_PHYSMAP
+	select PXA_SSP
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#1191: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/xcep.c:1:
+/*  linux/arch/arm/mach-pxa/xcep.c

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#1191: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/xcep.c:1:
+/*  linux/arch/arm/mach-pxa/xcep.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#1240: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/xcep.c:50:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#1352: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/xcep.c:162:
+ * See also Documentation/i2c/porting-clients. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
