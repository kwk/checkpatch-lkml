Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#51: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c:1423:
+	uint32_t max_oobsize = ops->mode == MTD_OOB_AUTO ?

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#61: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c:1476:
 			if (unlikely(oob)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
