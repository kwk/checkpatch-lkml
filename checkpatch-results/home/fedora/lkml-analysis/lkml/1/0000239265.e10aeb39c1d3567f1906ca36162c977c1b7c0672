Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...

+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "nv_probe: set workarund bit for reversed mac addr\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'nv_probe', this function's name, in a string
#67: FILE: drivers/net/forcedeth.c:5646:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "nv_probe: set workarund bit for reversed mac addr\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devexit is unnecessary
#93: FILE: drivers/net/forcedeth.c:5909:
+static void __devexit nv_remove(struct pci_dev *pci_dev)
