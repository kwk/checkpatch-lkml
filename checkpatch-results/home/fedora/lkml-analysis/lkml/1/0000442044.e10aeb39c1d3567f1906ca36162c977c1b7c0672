CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: include/linux/vmalloc.h:72:
+extern struct vm_struct *alloc_vm_area(unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#55: FILE: include/linux/vmalloc.h:73:
+extern void free_vm_area(struct vm_struct *area);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!area"
#89: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:782:
+	if (area == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#103: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:796:
+	/* Make sure the pagetables are constructed in process kernel
+	   mappings */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#103: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:796:
+	   mappings */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#113: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:806:
+	struct vm_struct *ret;
+	ret = remove_vm_area(area->addr);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#114: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:807:
+	BUG_ON(ret != area);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
