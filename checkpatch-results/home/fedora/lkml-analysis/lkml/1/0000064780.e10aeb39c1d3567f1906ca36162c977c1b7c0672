WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+	depends on CPU_SUP_AMD && X86_MCE
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  Enable this option if you want to decode Machine Check Exceptions

+	  You should definitely say Y here in case you want to decode MCEs
+	  which occur really early upon boot, before the module infrastructure
+	  has been initialized.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
