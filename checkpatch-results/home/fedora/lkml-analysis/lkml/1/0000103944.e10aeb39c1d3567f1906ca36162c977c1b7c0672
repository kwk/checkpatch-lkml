WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct regulator_ops should normally be const
#349: FILE: drivers/regulator/pcap-regulator.c:257:
+static struct regulator_ops pcap_regulator_ops =3D {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
