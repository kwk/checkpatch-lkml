Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#111: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1299:
+		if (rt_mutex_trylock(&q->pi_state->pi_mutex))
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'finish_futex_lock_pi', this function's name, in a string
#140: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1328:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "finish_futex_lock_pi: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#141: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1329:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "finish_futex_lock_pi: "
+					"ret = %d pi-mutex: %p "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
