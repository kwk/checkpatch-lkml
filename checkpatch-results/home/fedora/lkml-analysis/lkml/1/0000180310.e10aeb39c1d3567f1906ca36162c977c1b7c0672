WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'childs' may be misspelled - perhaps 'children'?
#54: 
i[xds]rss values and i[xds]rss of childs. These are filled up in the
                                  ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'tsk' - possible side-effects?
#116: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1407:
+#define get_task_idrss(tsk) jiffies_to_clock_t( \
+			(tsk)->acct_total_vm_mem1 - \

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#165: FILE: kernel/fork.c:861:
+	sig->ixrss = sig->idrss = sig->isrss = sig->cixrss = sig->cidrss = sig->cisrss = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
