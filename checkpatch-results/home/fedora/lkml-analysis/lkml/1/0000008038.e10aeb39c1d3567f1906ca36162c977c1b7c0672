Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

#110: FILE: include/linux/pps_kernel.h:93:
+extern void pps_event(int source, struct pps_event_time *ts, int event,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
