+	  This tracer tracks the latency of the highest priority task
+	  to be scheduled in, starting from the point it has woken up.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo __read_mostly	bar" should be "foo __read_mostly bar"

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
