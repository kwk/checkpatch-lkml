Subject: [PATCH 1/14] score - New architecure port to SunplusCT S+CORE
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#48: FILE: arch/score/boot/Makefile:2:
+# arch/score/boot/Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#50: FILE: arch/score/boot/Makefile:4:
+# This file is subject to the terms and conditions of the GNU General $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
