WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#47: FILE: drivers/mfd/Kconfig:30:
+config MFD_JANZ_CMODIO
+	tristate "Support for Janz CMOD-IO PCI MODULbus Carrier Board"
+	---help---
+	  This is the core driver for the Janz CMOD-IO PCI MODULbus
+	  carrier board. This device is a PCI to MODULbus bridge which may
+	  host many different types of MODULbus daughterboards, including
+	  CAN and GPIO controllers.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#76: FILE: drivers/mfd/janz-cmodio.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#116: FILE: drivers/mfd/janz-cmodio.c:41:
+module_param_array(modules, charp, &num_modules, S_IRUGO);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

#272: FILE: drivers/mfd/janz-cmodio.c:197:
+}

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.
