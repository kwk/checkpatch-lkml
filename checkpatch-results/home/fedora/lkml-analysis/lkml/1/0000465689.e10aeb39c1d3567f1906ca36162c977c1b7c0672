ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:DATE_TIME: Use of the '__TIME__' macro makes the build non-deterministic
#62: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/ftdi-elan.c:2908:
+	       __TIME__, __DATE__);

It is generally desirable that building the same source code with
the same set of tools is reproducible, i.e. the output is always
exactly the same.

The kernel does *not* use the ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros,
and enables warnings if they are used as they can lead to
non-deterministic builds.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/kbuild/reproducible-builds.html#timestamps
