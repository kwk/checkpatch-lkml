WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#72: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#77: FILE: arch/s390/kvm/intercept.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/kvm_host.h> instead of <asm/kvm_host.h>
#94: FILE: arch/s390/kvm/intercept.c:18:
+#include <asm/kvm_host.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:ENOTSUPP: ENOTSUPP is not a SUSV4 error code, prefer EOPNOTSUPP
#118: FILE: arch/s390/kvm/intercept.c:42:
+	return -ENOTSUPP;

ENOTSUPP is not a standard error code and should be avoided in new patches.
EOPNOTSUPP should be used instead.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20200510182252.GA411829@lunn.ch/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#124: FILE: arch/s390/kvm/intercept.c:48:

+	vcpu->stat.exit_validity++;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#201: FILE: arch/s390/kvm/kvm-s390.c:407:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

#228: FILE: arch/s390/kvm/kvm-s390.c:434:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
