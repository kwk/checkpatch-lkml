CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ds)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dock_station)...)
#57: FILE: drivers/acpi/dock.c:954:
+	ds = kzalloc(sizeof(struct dock_station), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#92: FILE: drivers/acpi/dock.c:977:
+	platform_device_add_data(dock_device, &ds,
 		sizeof(struct dock_station *));
