ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#115: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/mmc_spi.c:751:
By the way, the indentation needs fixing here.

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

#123: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/mmc_spi.c:1093:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
