The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

+int blkif_getgeo(struct block_device *bd, struct hd_geometry *hg)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#66: FILE: drivers/block/xen-blkfront.c:141:
+	/* We don't have real geometry info, but let's at least return
+	   values consistent with the size of the device */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
