WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct hv_ops should normally be const
#57: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_lguest.c:62:
+static struct hv_ops lguest_cons = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
