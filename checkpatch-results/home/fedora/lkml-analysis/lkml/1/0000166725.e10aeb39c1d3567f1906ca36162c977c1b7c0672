The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/acpi.h> instead of <asm/acpi.h>
#70: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/fixmap.h:19:
+#include <asm/acpi.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#200: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/fixmap.h:147:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
