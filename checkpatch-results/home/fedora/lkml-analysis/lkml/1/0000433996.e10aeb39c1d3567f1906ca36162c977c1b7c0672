Signed-Off-By: KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#61: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:4426:
+	unsigned long last_pfn = info->end_pfn - 1;
+	pfn = info->start_pfn;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'zone != page_zone(pfn_to_page(pfn))'
#65: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:4430:
+	if ((zone != page_zone(pfn_to_page(pfn))) ||
+	    (zone != page_zone(pfn_to_page(last_pfn))))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'zone != page_zone(pfn_to_page(last_pfn))'
#65: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:4430:
+	if ((zone != page_zone(pfn_to_page(pfn))) ||
+	    (zone != page_zone(pfn_to_page(last_pfn))))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#105: FILE: include/linux/page_isolation.h:43:
+extern int capture_isolate_freed_pages(struct isolation_info *info);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
