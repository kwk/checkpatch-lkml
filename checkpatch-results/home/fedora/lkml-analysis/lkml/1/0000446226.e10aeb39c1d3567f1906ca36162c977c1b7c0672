#34: 
Make the AF_RXRPC module use its own workqueues with their own per-CPU threads.

Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#608: FILE: net/rxrpc/ar-internal.h:505:
+extern void rxrpc_reject_packet(struct rxrpc_local *, struct sk_buff *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct rxrpc_local *' should also have an identifier name
#608: FILE: net/rxrpc/ar-internal.h:505:
+extern void rxrpc_reject_packet(struct rxrpc_local *, struct sk_buff *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct sk_buff *' should also have an identifier name
