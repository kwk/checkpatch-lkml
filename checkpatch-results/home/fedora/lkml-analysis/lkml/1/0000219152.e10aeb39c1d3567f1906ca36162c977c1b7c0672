#70: FILE: mm/migrate.c:844:
+	struct radix_tree_root *root = (struct radix_tree_root *) private;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#71: FILE: mm/migrate.c:845:
+	struct page_to_node *pm = (struct page_to_node *) radix_tree_lookup(root, (unsigned long) p);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
