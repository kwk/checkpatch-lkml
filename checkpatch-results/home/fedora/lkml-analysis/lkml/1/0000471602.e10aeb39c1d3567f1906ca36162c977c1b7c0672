WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#132: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-dma.c:489:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ide_dma_host_on);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#265: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/sgiioc4.c:310:
+static void sgiioc4_dma_host_on(ide_drive_t * drive)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#326: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1293:
+void ide_dma_host_on(ide_drive_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
