In a unixbench run, these patches had a performance impact of 2% (slowdown).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#183: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:263:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#238: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:307:
+	if (pc) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#542: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:30:
+extern void page_reset_bad_cgroup(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
