WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#45: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: include/linux/compaction.h:15:
+extern int compaction_register_node(struct node *node);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#88: FILE: include/linux/compaction.h:16:
+extern void compaction_unregister_node(struct node *node);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#122: FILE: mm/compaction.c:419:
+ssize_t sysfs_compact_node(struct sys_device *dev,
+			struct sysdev_attribute *attr,

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0200'.
#129: FILE: mm/compaction.c:426:
+static SYSDEV_ATTR(compact, S_IWUSR, NULL, sysfs_compact_node);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
