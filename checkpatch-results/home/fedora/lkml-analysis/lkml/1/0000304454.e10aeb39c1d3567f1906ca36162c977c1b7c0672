#16: 
Subject: [PATCH 108/148] include/asm-x86/semaphore_64.h: checkpatch cleanups - formatting only

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '__down_failed_interruptible', this function's name, in a string
#133: FILE: include/asm-x86/semaphore_64.h:130:
+		     "call __down_failed_interruptible\n"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
