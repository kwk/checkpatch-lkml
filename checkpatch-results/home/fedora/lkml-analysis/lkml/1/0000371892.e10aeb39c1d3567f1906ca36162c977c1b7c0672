#35: 
> > Most of these fixes were already submitted for old kernel versions, and were approved, but for some reason they never made it into the releases.  I've updated the changes for the 2.6.23 kernel and attached the resulting patch.  Because this is a consolidation of a couple old missed patches, it touches both Kconfigs and documentation texts.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#49: 
--- a/arch/arm/Kconfig	2007-10-09 16:31:38.000000000 -0400

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
