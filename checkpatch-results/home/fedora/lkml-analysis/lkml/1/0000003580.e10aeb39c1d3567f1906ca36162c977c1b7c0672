WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#72: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:20:
+extern char **environ;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: char * array declaration might be better as static const
#122: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:481:
+			char *newargv[] = { cmdline, path, NULL };

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "slv"
#141: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:500:
+			if (slv != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
