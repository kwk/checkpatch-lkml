CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1052:
+extern int early_pfn_to_solid(unsigned long pfn);

files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+int early_pfn_to_nid(unsigned long pfn)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
