#25: 
numa.c is the only user of the {in,out}*_quad functions. And it has only a few call

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#50: FILE: arch/x86/pci/numa.c:18:
+extern void *xquad_portio;    /* Where the IO area was mapped */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
