WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#41: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:2769:
+	if (EXT3_SB(sb)->s_uid && inode->i_uid == 0) {
+		inode->i_uid = EXT3_SB(sb)->s_uid;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
