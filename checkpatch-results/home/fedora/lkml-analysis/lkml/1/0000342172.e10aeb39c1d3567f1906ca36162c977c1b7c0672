WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#41: FILE: arch/cris/arch-v10/boot/Makefile:2:
+# arch/cris/arch-v10/boot/Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
