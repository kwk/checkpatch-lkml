The old struct mce had a limitation to 256 CPUs. But x86 Linux supports more than

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#133: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c:111:
+	m->cpu = m->extcpu = smp_processor_id();

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
