CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#98: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2612:
+	p->prio = p->normal_prio = normal_prio(current);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
