CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment
#98: FILE: mm/memory.c:1499:
+	spinlock_t *ptl;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#102: FILE: mm/memory.c:1503:
+	BUG_ON(PageAnon(newpage));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
