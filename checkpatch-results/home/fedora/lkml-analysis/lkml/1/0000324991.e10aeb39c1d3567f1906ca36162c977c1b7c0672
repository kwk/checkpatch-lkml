Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#761: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/acpi/realmode/Makefile:2:
+# arch/x86/kernel/acpi/realmode/Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
