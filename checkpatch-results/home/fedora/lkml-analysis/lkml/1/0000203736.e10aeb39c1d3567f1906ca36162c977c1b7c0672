Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'nr[LRU_INACTIVE_FILE] > nr[LRU_ACTIVE_FILE]'
#101: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1453:
+	if (priority == PRIO_CACHE_ONLY &&
+			(nr[LRU_INACTIVE_FILE] > nr[LRU_ACTIVE_FILE]))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#102: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1454:
+	if (priority == PRIO_CACHE_ONLY &&
+			(nr[LRU_INACTIVE_FILE] > nr[LRU_ACTIVE_FILE]))
