CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: include/linux/list.h:728:
+extern void hlist_check(struct hlist_node *n);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#130: FILE: lib/list_debug.c:88:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "n->next"
#132: FILE: lib/list_debug.c:90:
+	if (unlikely(n->next != NULL && n->next->pprev != &n->next)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
