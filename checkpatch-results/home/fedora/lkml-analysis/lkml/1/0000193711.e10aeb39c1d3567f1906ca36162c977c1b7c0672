#31: 
Remove BTS bits from the hw-branch-tracer (renamed from bts-tracer) and use the ds interface.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#322: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_hw_branches.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#339: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_hw_branches.c:18:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#340: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_hw_branches.c:19:
+#define SIZEOF_BTS (1 << 13)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#478: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_hw_branches.c:157:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#511: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_hw_branches.c:190:
+struct tracer bts_tracer __read_mostly =

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
