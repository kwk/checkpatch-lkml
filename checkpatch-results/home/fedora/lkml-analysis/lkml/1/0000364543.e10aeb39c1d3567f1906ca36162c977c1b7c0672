The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#50: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_pnp.c:347:
+       /* LG C1 EXPRESS DUAL (C1-PB11A3) touch screen (actually a FUJ02E6
+       {       "LTS0001",              0       },

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
