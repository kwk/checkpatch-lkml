Atleast until 2.6.25-rc8-mm2, I would expect the marker registration to

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#97: FILE: kernel/marker.c:378:
+	for (iter = __start___markers;
[...]
+			iter++);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#152: FILE: kernel/marker.c:636:
+int marker_probe_register(const char *name, marker_probe_func *probe,
+							void *probe_private)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#175: FILE: include/linux/marker.h:122:
+extern int marker_probe_register(const char *name, marker_probe_func *probe,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
