#26: 
A patch is coming that requires earlier detection of system type (UV or non-UV)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: include/asm-x86/genapic_64.h:43:
+extern int acpi_early_madt_oem_check(struct acpi_table_header *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct acpi_table_header *' should also have an identifier name
#96: FILE: include/asm-x86/genapic_64.h:43:
+extern int acpi_early_madt_oem_check(struct acpi_table_header *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
