Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#492: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/traps.c:37:
+	kstack_depth_to_print = strict_strtoul(s, 0, NULL);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
