WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#54: FILE: fs/mpage.c:465:
+	unsigned use_writepage;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#169: FILE: fs/mpage.c:709:
+	if (!get_block)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#280: FILE: fs/mpage.c:737:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
