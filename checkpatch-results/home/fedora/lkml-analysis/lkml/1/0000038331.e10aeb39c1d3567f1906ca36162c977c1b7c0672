WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#35: 
This patch fixes it by extending mincore() system call to support hugepages.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'creat' may be misspelled - perhaps 'create'?
#40: 
 - creat() and mmap() a file on hugetlbfs (file size is 200MB == 100 hugepages,)
   ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#129: FILE: mm/mincore.c:80:
+		unsigned char present;
+		i = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#138: FILE: mm/mincore.c:89:
+			 * but generally it needs to be check */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
