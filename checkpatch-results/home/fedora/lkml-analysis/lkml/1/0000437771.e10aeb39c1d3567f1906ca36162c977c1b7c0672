The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'munge_demoted', this function's name, in a string
#94: FILE: fs/dlm/lock.c:1215:

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#121: FILE: fs/dlm/lock.c:1242:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
