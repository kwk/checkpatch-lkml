Subject: [PATCH 3/10] x86: microcode_amd: fix checkpatch warnings/errors

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#62: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode_amd.c:229:
+static void *get_next_ucode(u8 *buf, unsigned int size,
 			int (*get_ucode_data)(void *, const void *, size_t),

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#90: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode_amd.c:347:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

+			pr_debug("microcode: CPU%d found a matching microcode "
+				 "update with version 0x%x (current=0x%x)\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
