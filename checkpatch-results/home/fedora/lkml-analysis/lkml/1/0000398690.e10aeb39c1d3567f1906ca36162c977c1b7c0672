CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'newnd->dentry == new->dentry->d_parent'
#97: FILE: fs/namei.c:3532:
+	if ((newnd->dentry == new->dentry->d_parent) && new->dentry->d_inode) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#127: FILE: fs/namei.c:3562:
+/*
+	if (!error) {

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
