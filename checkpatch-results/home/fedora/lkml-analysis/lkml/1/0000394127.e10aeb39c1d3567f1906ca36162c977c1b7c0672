Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

I think this condition checks are much easier to understand than considering

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#101: FILE: arch/ia64/mm/init.c:63:
+	BUG_ON(!pte_exec(pte));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#142: FILE: include/asm-ia64/pgtable.h:321:
+extern void __ia64_sync_icache_dcache(pte_t pteval);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
