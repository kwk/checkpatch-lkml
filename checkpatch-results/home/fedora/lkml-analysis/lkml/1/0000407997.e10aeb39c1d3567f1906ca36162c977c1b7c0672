CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:81:
+extern void hibernation_add_image_ops(struct hibernation_image_ops *ops);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#174: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:475:
+	return buf-start;
 	          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#222: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:342:
+static struct hibernation_image_ops uswsusp_hibernation_image_ops =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
