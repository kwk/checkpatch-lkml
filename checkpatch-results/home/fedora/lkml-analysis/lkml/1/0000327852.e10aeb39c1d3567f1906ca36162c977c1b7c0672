WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#159: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:825:
+	ide_end_drive_cmd(drive, ide_read_status(drive),
 			hwif->INB(IDE_ERROR_REG));

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#288: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-iops.c:870:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#332: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:279:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "%s: probing with STATUS(0x%02x) "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#333: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:280:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "%s: probing with STATUS(0x%02x) "
+					 "instead of ALTSTATUS(0x%02x)\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
