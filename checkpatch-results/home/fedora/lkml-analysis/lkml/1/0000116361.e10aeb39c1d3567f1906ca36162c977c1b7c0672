Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct hist_entry *' should also have an identifier name
#101: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:308:
+	int64_t (*collapse)(struct hist_entry *, struct hist_entry *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#159: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:449:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
