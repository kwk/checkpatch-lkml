WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#114: FILE: mm/sparse.c:414:
+		struct page *memmap_page;
+		memmap_page = virt_to_page(memmap);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#147: FILE: mm/internal.h:37:
+extern void __free_pages_bootmem(struct page *page, unsigned int order);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
