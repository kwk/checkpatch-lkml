Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#402: FILE: checkpoint/restart.c:569:
+			root = task = next_thread(task);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#642: FILE: checkpoint/sys.c:192:
+	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&ctx->refcount));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#755: FILE: include/linux/checkpoint.h:37:
+#define CKPT_CTX_SUCCESS	(1 << CKPT_CTX_SUCCESS_BIT)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#756: FILE: include/linux/checkpoint.h:38:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#771: FILE: include/linux/checkpoint.h:44:
+extern void exit_checkpoint(struct task_struct *tsk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
