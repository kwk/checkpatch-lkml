CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!data"
#117: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c:369:
+	if (data == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#121: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c:373:
+	BUG_ON(data->blksz * data->blocks > 524288);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#122: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c:374:
+	BUG_ON(data->blksz > host->mmc->max_blk_size);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#123: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c:375:
+	BUG_ON(data->blocks > 65535);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#141: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.h:182:
+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_TIMEOUT_VAL			(1<<10)
                                       			  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#141: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.h:182:
+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_TIMEOUT_VAL			(1<<10)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
