WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#39: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pgtable.c:3:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgtable.h:302:
+extern int ptep_set_access_flags(struct vm_area_struct *vma,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
