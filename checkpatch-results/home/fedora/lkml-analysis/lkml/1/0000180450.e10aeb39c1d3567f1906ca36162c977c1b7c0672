CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: struct mutex definition without comment
#83: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_stat.c:29:
+	struct mutex		stat_mutex;

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*session)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct tracer_stat_session)...)
#218: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_stat.c:282:
+	session = kmalloc(sizeof(struct tracer_stat_session), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
