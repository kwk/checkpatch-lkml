WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#130: FILE: drivers/net/phy/phy_device.c:53:
+extern int mdio_bus_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#131: FILE: drivers/net/phy/phy_device.c:54:
+extern void mdio_bus_exit(void);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "bus->irq"
#142: FILE: drivers/net/phy/phy_device.c:171:
+	dev->irq = bus->irq != NULL ? bus->irq[addr] : PHY_POLL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#159: FILE: drivers/net/phy/phy_device.c:252:
+	 * address */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
