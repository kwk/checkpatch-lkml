Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#123: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mpspec.h:160:
+extern void numaq_mps_oem_check(struct mpc_table *, char *, char *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct mpc_table *' should also have an identifier name
#123: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mpspec.h:160:
+extern void numaq_mps_oem_check(struct mpc_table *, char *, char *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char *' should also have an identifier name
