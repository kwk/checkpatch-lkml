Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#227: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:101:
+		struct kobject *dup_slot;
+		dup_slot = kset_find_obj(pci_slots_kset, new_name);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#342: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:204:
+	if (slot && rename) {
[...]
-		}
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#344: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:206:
+		if (err) {

[...]

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#348: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:210:
+		} else
