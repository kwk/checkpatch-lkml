ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['

+static const unsigned char real_mode_switch [] =

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#81: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c:249:
 };
+static const unsigned char jump_to_bios [] =

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
