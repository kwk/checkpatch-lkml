CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pages"
#147: FILE: arch/um/kernel/skas/mmu.c:121:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'arch_dup_mmap', this function's name, in a string
#148: FILE: arch/um/kernel/skas/mmu.c:122:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "arch_dup_mmap failed to allocate 2 page "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
