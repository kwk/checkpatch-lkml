WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#106: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:170:
+	BUG_ON(inode->i_state & I_SYNC);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_ALL'
#139: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:262:
+	if ((wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_ALL) && (inode->i_state & I_SYNC)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'seperate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'separate'?
#243: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1218:
+ *			of inode dirty data.  Having a seperate lock for this
   			                               ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#267: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1238:
+#define I_SYNC			(1 << __I_SYNC)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#277: FILE: include/linux/writeback.h:80:
 }
+static inline void inode_sync_wait(struct inode *inode)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#281: FILE: include/linux/writeback.h:84:
+	wait_on_bit(&inode->i_state, __I_SYNC, inode_wait,
+							TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#294: FILE: fs/inode.c:231:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
