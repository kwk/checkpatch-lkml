Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#185: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:1233:
+	BUG_ON((unsigned)irq >= NR_IRQS);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#185: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:1233:
+	BUG_ON((unsigned)irq >= NR_IRQS);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
