WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#57: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#62: FILE: arch/i386/boot/a20.c:1:
+/* -*- linux-c -*- ------------------------------------------------------- *

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#70: FILE: arch/i386/boot/a20.c:9:
+ * ----------------------------------------------------------------------- */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#73: FILE: arch/i386/boot/a20.c:12:
+ * arch/i386/boot/a20.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#105: FILE: arch/i386/boot/a20.c:44:
+/* Returns nonzero if the A20 line is enabled.  The memory address
+   used as a test is the int $0x80 vector, which should be safe. */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#105: FILE: arch/i386/boot/a20.c:44:
+   used as a test is the int $0x80 vector, which should be safe. */

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#107: FILE: arch/i386/boot/a20.c:46:
+#define A20_TEST_ADDR	(4*0x80)
                      	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#119: FILE: arch/i386/boot/a20.c:58:
+	saved = ctr = rdfs32(A20_TEST_ADDR);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#124: FILE: arch/i386/boot/a20.c:63:
+		ok = rdgs32(A20_TEST_ADDR+0x10) ^ ctr;
 		                         ^

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#140: FILE: arch/i386/boot/a20.c:79:
