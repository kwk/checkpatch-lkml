CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "kdb_poll_funcs[i]"
#146: FILE: kernel/debug/gdbstub.c:74:
+		for (i = 0; kdb_poll_funcs[i] != NULL; i++) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#157: FILE: kernel/debug/gdbstub.c:85:
+	int ret = dbg_io_ops->read_char();
+	while (ret == NO_POLL_CHAR)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
