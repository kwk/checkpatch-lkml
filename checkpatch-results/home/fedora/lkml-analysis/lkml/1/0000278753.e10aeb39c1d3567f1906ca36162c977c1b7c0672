WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#118: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_core.c:53:
+#define uart_users(state)	((state)->count + ((state)->info ? (state)->info->port.blocked_open : 0))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!info->port.tty"
#306: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_core.c:1474:
+		if (tty_hung_up_p(filp) || info->port.tty == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
