WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#44: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/vpe.c:473:
 				printk(KERN_DEBUG "VPE loader: "
+				       "apply_r_mips_lo16/hi16: \t"

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'apply_r_mips_lo16', this function's name, in a string
#44: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/vpe.c:473:
+				       "apply_r_mips_lo16/hi16: \t"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#53: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/vpe.c:632:
