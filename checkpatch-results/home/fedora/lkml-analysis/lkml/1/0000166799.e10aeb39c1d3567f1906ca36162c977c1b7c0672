WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#92: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:1485:
+    u64 uninitialized_var(native_sectors);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'native_sectors' should also have an identifier name
#92: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:1485:
+    u64 uninitialized_var(native_sectors);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#243: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_atiixp.c:143:
+    else panic("atiixp_set_dmamode: unknown DMA mode!");

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'atiixp_set_dmamode', this function's name, in a string
#243: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_atiixp.c:143:
+    else panic("atiixp_set_dmamode: unknown DMA mode!");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
