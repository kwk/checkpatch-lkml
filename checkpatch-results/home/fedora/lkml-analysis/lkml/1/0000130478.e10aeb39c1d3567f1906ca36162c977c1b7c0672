#33: 
Replace a combination call of kmalloc() and copy_from_user() with memdup_user().

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#51: FILE: drivers/usb/class/cdc-wdm.c:327:
+       desc->outbuf = buf = memdup_user(buffer, count);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#53: FILE: drivers/usb/class/cdc-wdm.c:329:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
