> Can we use the CPU hotplug for that, like in the suspend/hibernation case?

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#60: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/reboot.c:398:
+	extern int cpu_down(unsigned int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'kill_cpu1', this function's name, in a string

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
