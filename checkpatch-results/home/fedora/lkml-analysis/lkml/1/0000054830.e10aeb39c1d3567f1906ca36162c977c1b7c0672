WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '&' (ctx:VxV)
#77: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:641:
+	if (lsr&UART_LSR_BRK_ERROR_BITS) {
 	       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'urb->actual_length == 4'
#110: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:674:
+		if ((urb->actual_length == 4) && (data[0] == 0xe8)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'data[0] == 0xe8'
#110: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:674:
+		if ((urb->actual_length == 4) && (data[0] == 0xe8)) {

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '&' (ctx:VxV)
#111: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:675:
+			const __u8 id = data[1]&UART_IIR_ID;
 			                       ^

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#112: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:676:
+			const __u8 id = data[1]&UART_IIR_ID;
+			dbg("%s: iir=%02x", __func__, data[1]);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#140: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:704:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'erors' may be misspelled - perhaps 'errors'?
#141: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:705:
+/* Data comes in via the bulk (data) URB, erors/interrupts via the int URB.
                                           ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#163: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:727:
+		int i;
+		for (i = 0; i < size; ++i)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#223: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:787:
+		if (port->throttled) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#226: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:790:
+			return;
+		} else

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#226: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:790:
+		} else

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#233: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:797:
+		dev_err(&urb->dev->dev, "%s - failed resubmitting"
+			" read urb, error %d\n", __func__, result);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
