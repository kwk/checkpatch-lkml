WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#150: FILE: fs/buffer.c:633:
+ * fsync_buffers_list() from removing the buffer we are just adding. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#255: FILE: fs/buffer.c:777:
+			BUG_ON(list_empty(&bh->b_assoc_buffers));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
