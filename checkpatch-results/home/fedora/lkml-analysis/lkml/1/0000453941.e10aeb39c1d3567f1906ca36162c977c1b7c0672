WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#49: FILE: fs/anon_inodes.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#50: FILE: fs/anon_inodes.c:2:
+ *  fs/anon_inodes.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>

+#include <asm/uaccess.h>

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#71: FILE: fs/anon_inodes.c:23:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#88: FILE: fs/anon_inodes.c:40:
+static struct dentry_operations ainofs_dentry_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#172: FILE: fs/anon_inodes.c:124:
+	iput(inode);
 	^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0600'.
#209: FILE: fs/anon_inodes.c:161:
+	inode->i_mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR;

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#212: FILE: fs/anon_inodes.c:164:
+	inode->i_atime = inode->i_mtime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#247: FILE: fs/anon_inodes.c:199:
+	printk(KERN_ERR "aino_init() failed (%d)\n", error);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'aino_init', this function's name, in a string
#247: FILE: fs/anon_inodes.c:199:
+	printk(KERN_ERR "aino_init() failed (%d)\n", error);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
