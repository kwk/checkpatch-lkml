WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#102: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#107: FILE: fs/fincore.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#108: FILE: fs/fincore.c:2:
+ *	fs/fincore.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#127: FILE: fs/fincore.c:21:
+	struct page *page = find_get_page(mapping, pgoff);
+	if (page) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#164: FILE: fs/fincore.c:58:
+	struct file *filp;
 	             ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#170: FILE: fs/fincore.c:64:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#213: FILE: fs/fincore.c:107:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
