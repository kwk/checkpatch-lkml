CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#50: FILE: fs/ocfs2/blockcheck.c:42:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#62: FILE: fs/ocfs2/blockcheck.c:54:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <MultiplyDeBruijnBitPosition>
#63: FILE: fs/ocfs2/blockcheck.c:55:
+	static const int MultiplyDeBruijnBitPosition[32] =

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#64: FILE: fs/ocfs2/blockcheck.c:56:
+	static const int MultiplyDeBruijnBitPosition[32] =
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#89: FILE: fs/ocfs2/blockcheck.c:99:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
