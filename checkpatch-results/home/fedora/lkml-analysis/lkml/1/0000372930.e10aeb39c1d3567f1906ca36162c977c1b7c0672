In order to free objects we need to touch the page struct of the page that the

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#186: FILE: mm/slub.c:1736:
+static void __always_inline slab_free(struct kmem_cache *s, void *x,

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
