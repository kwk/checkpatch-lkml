WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#51: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#56: FILE: include/asm-generic/dma-coherent.h:1:
+#ifndef DMA_COHERENT_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_DMA_DECLARE_COHERENT_MEMORY' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#71: FILE: include/asm-generic/dma-coherent.h:16:
+#define ARCH_HAS_DMA_DECLARE_COHERENT_MEMORY

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dev->dma_mem)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dma_coherent_mem)...)
#156: FILE: kernel/dma-coherent.c:36:
+	dev->dma_mem = kzalloc(sizeof(struct dma_coherent_mem), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+int dma_alloc_from_coherent(struct device *dev, ssize_t size,

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "mem"
#232: FILE: kernel/dma-coherent.c:112:
+	return (mem != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
