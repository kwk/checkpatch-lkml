ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#62: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:256:
+extern struct page * read_cache_page_gfp(struct address_space *mapping,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:256:
+extern struct page * read_cache_page_gfp(struct address_space *mapping,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
