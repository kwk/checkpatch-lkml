+	config TOI_REPLACE_SWSUSP
+		bool "Replace swsusp by default"
+		default y
+		depends on TOI_CORE
+		---help---
+		  TuxOnIce can replace swsusp. This option makes that the default state,
+		  requiring you to echo 0 > /sys/power/tuxonice/replace_swsusp if you want
+		  to use the vanilla kernel functionality. Note that your initrd/ramfs will
+		  need to do this before trying to resume, too.
+		  With overriding swsusp enabled, echoing disk  to /sys/power/state will
+		  start a TuxOnIce cycle. If resume= doesn't specify an allocator and both
+		  the swap and file allocators are compiled in, the swap allocator will be
+		  used by default.
+
 	config TOI_IGNORE_LATE_INITCALL
 		bool "Wait for initrd/ramfs to run, by default"
 		default n

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
