CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#196: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:239:
+extern int task_on_rq(int cpu, struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#197: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:240:
+extern struct task_struct *get_task_on_rq(int cpu);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#233: FILE: kernel/lock_stat.c:2:
+ * kernel/lock_stat.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#588: FILE: kernel/lock_stat.c:296:
+static struct lock_stat * lock_stat_lookup_object(LOCK_STAT_NOTE_PARAM_DECL)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#810: FILE: kernel/lock_stat.c:532:
+static struct file_operations lock_stat_procfs_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!lock_stat_procfs_dir"
#821: FILE: kernel/lock_stat.c:543:
+	if (lock_stat_procfs_dir == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!lock_stat_procfs_entry"
#826: FILE: kernel/lock_stat.c:548:
+	if (lock_stat_procfs_entry == NULL)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#834: FILE: kernel/lock_stat.c:556:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
