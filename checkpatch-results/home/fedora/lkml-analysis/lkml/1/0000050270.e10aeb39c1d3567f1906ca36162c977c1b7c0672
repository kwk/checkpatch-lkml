#29: 
The driver is at staging/iio/light/tsl2563.c for now since the IIO subsystem

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after rx51_peripherals_i2c_board_info_2[]
#71: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-rx51-peripherals.c:443:
+static struct i2c_board_info __initdata rx51_peripherals_i2c_board_info_2[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
