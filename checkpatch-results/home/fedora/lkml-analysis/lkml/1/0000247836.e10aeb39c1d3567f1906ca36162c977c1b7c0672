WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'u3_insert_memory', this function's name, in a string
#849: FILE: drivers/char/agp/uninorth-agp.c:201:
+				 "u3_insert_memory: entry 0x%x occupied (%x)\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
