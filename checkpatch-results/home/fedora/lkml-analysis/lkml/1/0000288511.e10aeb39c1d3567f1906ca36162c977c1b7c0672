auditing for BKL dependancies
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#45: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:817:
+		unsigned long page  = get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL);
+		if (page == 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#55: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:822:
+			port->xmit_buf = (unsigned char *) page;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
