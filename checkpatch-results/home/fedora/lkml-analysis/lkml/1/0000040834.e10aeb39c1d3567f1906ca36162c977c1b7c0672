> > > > This test case fails in 2.6.23-2.6.25, because of the bug fixed in 864f24395c72b6a6c48d13f409f986dc71a5cf4a, and now again in at least 2.6.31 and 2.6.32pre8 because of a *different* bug. This test *does not* fail 2.6.26. I have not tested anything between 2.6.26 and 2.6.31.

ONLY THEN is the file corrupted. That is, I won't hesitate to say *incredibly evil* behavior: it took me quite some time to figure out WTH was going wrong with my program before determining it was a kernel bug.
