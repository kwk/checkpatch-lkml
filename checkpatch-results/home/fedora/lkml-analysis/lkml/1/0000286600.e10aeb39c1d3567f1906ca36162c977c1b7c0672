#32: 
With commit "3f1b0e1f287547903f11fa1e6de7d2765597766e" Linus's current git tree starts to ignore any "*.rej" files. So "git status" no longer shows these files, but the ones who works with quilt patchsets, this not makes life easier as expected. Because sometimes a work flow (at least for me) requires "quilt push -f" followed by "git status" to see unresolved merge conflicts, work on these conflicts to correct them and finalize the patch with "quilt refresh".

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
