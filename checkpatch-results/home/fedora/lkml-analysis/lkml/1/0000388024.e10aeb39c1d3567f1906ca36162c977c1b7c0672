Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rcu_torture_preempt', this function's name, in a string
#87: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:279:
+		printk(KERN_ALERT "rcu_torture_preempt() priority err: %d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "rcu_preeempt_task"
#120: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:312:
+	if (rcu_preeempt_task != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#127: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:319:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be

#224: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:906:

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
