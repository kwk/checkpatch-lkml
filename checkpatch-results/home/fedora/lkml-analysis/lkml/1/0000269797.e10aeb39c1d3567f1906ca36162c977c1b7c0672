Subject: [PATCH] Alchemy: register mmc platform device for db1200/pb1200 boards

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#87: FILE: arch/mips/au1000/common/platform.c:235:
+extern struct au1xmmc_platform_data au1xmmc_platdata[2];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#152: FILE: arch/mips/au1000/common/platform.c:296:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#194: FILE: arch/mips/au1000/pb1200/platform.c:28:
+static int mmc_activity = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#217: FILE: arch/mips/au1000/pb1200/platform.c:51:
+static void pb1200_mmcled_set(struct led_classdev *led,
+			enum led_brightness brightness)
