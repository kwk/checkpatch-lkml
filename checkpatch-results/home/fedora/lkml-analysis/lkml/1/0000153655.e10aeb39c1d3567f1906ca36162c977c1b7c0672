Changeset bc9b83dd1f66402b870301c3c7117b9c1484abb4 "cpumask: convert c1e_mask

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/processor.h:736:
+extern void init_c1e_mask(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "c1e_mask"
#99: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/process.c:482:
+	if (c1e_mask != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
