Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#795: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:145:

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'irq_desc', this function's name, in a string
#834: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:193:
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG "irq_desc ==> [%#lx - %#lx]\n", phys, phys + total_bytes);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#882: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:456:
+	struct irq_desc *desc = irq_desc(irq);
+	return desc->kstat_irqs[cpu];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
