WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#175: FILE: fs/fat/namei_vfat.c:169:
+static struct dentry_operations vfat_ci_dentry_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
