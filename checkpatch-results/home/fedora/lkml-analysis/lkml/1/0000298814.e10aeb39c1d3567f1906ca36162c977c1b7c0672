#37: 
As per our current requirements, we have decided to keep the stats tick based as opposed to using CFS precise accounting.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#69: FILE: kernel/sched.c:185:
+static void __cpu_cgroup_stat_add(struct cpu_cgroup_stat *stat,
+		enum cpu_cgroup_stat_index idx, int val)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#73: FILE: kernel/sched.c:189:
+	BUG_ON(!irqs_disabled());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#95: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3769:
+	struct task_group *tg;
+	tg = task_group(p);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
