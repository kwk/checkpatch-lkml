ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#73: FILE: kernel/stop_machine.c:44:
+unsigned long stopmachine_timeout = 0; /* msecs, 0 = "never timeout" */

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'stucked' may be misspelled - perhaps 'stuck'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
