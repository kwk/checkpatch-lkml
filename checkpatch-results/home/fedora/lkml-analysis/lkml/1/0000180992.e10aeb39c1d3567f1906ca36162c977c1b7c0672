WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'wont't' may be misspelled - perhaps 'won't'?
#47: 
wont't work on marvel. Actually I think that we should just disable
^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct rtc_time *' should also have an identifier name
#80: FILE: arch/alpha/include/asm/machvec.h:98:
+	unsigned int (*rtc_get_time)(struct rtc_time *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct rtc_time *' should also have an identifier name

+	int (*rtc_set_time)(struct rtc_time *);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#155: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/proto.h:148:
+extern unsigned int common_get_rtc_time(struct rtc_time *time);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
