WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .7
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'fpr' may be misspelled - perhaps 'for'?
#77: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/signal_64.c:182:
+	 * This has to be done before copying stuff into current->thread.fpr/vr
 	                                                                 ^^^

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (15, 24)
#102: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:74:
                for (i = 0; i < pgdat->node_spanned_pages; ++i) {
+			if (!pfn_valid(pgdat->node_start_pfn + i))

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#115: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c		Version 1.04	Jun 4, 2007

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinitdata is unnecessary
#139: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:451:
 static struct hpt_info hpt374 __devinitdata = {

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#256: FILE: drivers/md/dm-crypt.c:631:
+		 * before we kick off the request */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#263: FILE: drivers/md/dm-crypt.c:638:
+		 * may be gone already. */

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#268: FILE: drivers/md/dm-crypt.c:642:
+			congestion_wait(WRITE, HZ/100);
 			                         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#307: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1249:
+				if (test_bit(BIO_UPTODATE, &sbio->bi_flags)) {
[...]
+				} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#310: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1252:
+						struct page *p, *s;
+						p = pbio->bi_io_vec[j].bv_page;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#312: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1254:
+						if (memcmp(page_address(p),

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1328311239.21255.24.camel@joe2Laptop/

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#317: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1259:
+				} else

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#413: FILE: drivers/media/video/cx88/cx88-blackbird.c:1037:
+	if (0 != t->index)

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'current->euid != p->euid'
#633: FILE: kernel/futex.c:394:
+	if (!p || ((current->euid != p->euid) && (current->euid != p->uid)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'current->euid != p->uid'
#633: FILE: kernel/futex.c:394:
+	if (!p || ((current->euid != p->euid) && (current->euid != p->uid)))

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#873: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1364:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "futex_lock_pi: ret = %d "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'futex_lock_pi', this function's name, in a string
#873: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1364:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "futex_lock_pi: ret = %d "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#874: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1365:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "futex_lock_pi: ret = %d "
+				       "pi-mutex: %p pi-state %p\n", ret,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
