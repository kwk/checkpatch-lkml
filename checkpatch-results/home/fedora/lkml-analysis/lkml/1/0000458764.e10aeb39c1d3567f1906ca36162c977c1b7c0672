#45: 
1) Introduces a new method in 'struct dentry_operations'. This method called 

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dentry *' should also have an identifier name
#94: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:136:
+	char *(*d_dname)(struct dentry *, char *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char *' should also have an identifier name
#94: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:136:
