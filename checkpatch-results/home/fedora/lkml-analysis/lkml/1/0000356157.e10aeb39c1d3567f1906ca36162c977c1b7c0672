WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#56: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/mct_u232.c:210:
+		/* FIXME: Can we use any divider - should we do
+		   divider = 115200/value;

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#76: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/mct_u232.c:238:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#76: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/mct_u232.c:238:
+        speed_t speed;$

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#108: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/mct_u232.c:679:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
