Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#170: FILE: include/asm-generic/semaphore.h:28:
+extern void down_timeout_interruptible(struct semaphore *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct semaphore *' should also have an identifier name
#170: FILE: include/asm-generic/semaphore.h:28:
+extern void down_timeout_interruptible(struct semaphore *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
