WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#140: FILE: net/sunrpc/svc_xprt.c:318:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'svc_xprt_enqueue', this function's name, in a string
#141: FILE: net/sunrpc/svc_xprt.c:319:
+		       "svc_xprt_enqueue: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#142: FILE: net/sunrpc/svc_xprt.c:320:
+		       "svc_xprt_enqueue: "
+		       "threads and transports both waiting??\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
