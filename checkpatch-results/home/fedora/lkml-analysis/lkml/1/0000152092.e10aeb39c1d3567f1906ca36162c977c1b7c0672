WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'shrink_slab', this function's name, in a string
#91: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:217:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "shrink_slab: %pF negative objects to "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:VSPRINTF_POINTER_EXTENSION: Invalid vsprintf pointer extension '%pF' - use %pS instead

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
