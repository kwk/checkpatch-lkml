WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'do_state_action', this function's name, in a string
#75: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nandsim.c:1428:
+			NS_ERR("do_state_action: BUG! can't skip half of page for non-512 "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
