WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#246: FILE: kernel/kallsyms.c:122:
+ * beginning of the symbol name */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.
