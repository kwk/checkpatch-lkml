CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "p"
#174: FILE: block/blk-cgroup.c:260:
+	if (p != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#183: FILE: block/blk-cgroup.c:269:
+	ret = strict_strtoul(major_s, 10, &major);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
