WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#95: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#100: FILE: arch/avr32/oprofile/backtrace.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#104: FILE: arch/avr32/oprofile/backtrace.c:5:
+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#117: FILE: arch/avr32/oprofile/backtrace.c:18:
+#include <asm/uaccess.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#120: FILE: arch/avr32/oprofile/backtrace.c:21:
+ * frame pointers */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#130: FILE: arch/avr32/oprofile/backtrace.c:31:
+	return (p > (unsigned long)tinfo)
+		&& (p < (unsigned long)tinfo + THREAD_SIZE - 3);

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#134: FILE: arch/avr32/oprofile/backtrace.c:35:
+static struct frame_head * dump_user_backtrace(struct frame_head *head)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#180: FILE: arch/avr32/oprofile/backtrace.c:81:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#189: FILE: arch/avr32/oprofile/op_model_avr32.c:25:
+void avr32_backtrace(struct pt_regs * const regs, unsigned int depth);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
