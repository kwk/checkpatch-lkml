#29: 
Add a new taskstats command to register for notification, whenever a new task

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/taskstats_kern.h:29:
+extern void taskstats_fork(struct task_struct *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+static DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct listener_list, fork_listener_array);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#122: FILE: kernel/taskstats.c:302:

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#144: FILE: kernel/taskstats.c:336:
 	for_each_cpu(cpu, mask) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
