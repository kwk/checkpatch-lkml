WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#809: FILE: tools/perf/scripts/perl/workqueue-stats.pl:13:
+#   perf trace -p -s tools/perf/scripts/perl/workqueue-stats.pl

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
