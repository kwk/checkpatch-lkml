CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#106: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:293:
+extern irqreturn_t oneshot_irq_primary_handler(int irq, void *dev_id);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
