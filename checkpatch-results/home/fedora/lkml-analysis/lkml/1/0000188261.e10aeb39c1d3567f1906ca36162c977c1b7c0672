+extern void audit_filter_inodes(struct task_struct *, struct audit_context *);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: kernel/audit.h:162:
+extern void audit_filter_inodes(struct task_struct *, struct audit_context *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
