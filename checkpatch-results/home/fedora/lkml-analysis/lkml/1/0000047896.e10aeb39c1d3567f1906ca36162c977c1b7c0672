WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dma_map_ops should normally be const
#45: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma.c:18:
+struct dma_map_ops *dma_ops = &nommu_dma_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
