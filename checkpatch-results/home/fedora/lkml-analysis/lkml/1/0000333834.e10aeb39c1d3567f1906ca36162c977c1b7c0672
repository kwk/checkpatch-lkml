WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config CONTEXT_SWITCH_TRACER

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#113: FILE: lib/tracing/trace_sched_switch.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#139: FILE: lib/tracing/trace_sched_switch.c:27:
+	trace_nr_entries = simple_strtoul(str, &str, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
