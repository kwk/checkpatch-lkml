CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#85: FILE: kernel/compat.c:1108:
+		res |= __put_user((unsigned long) tmp, &uctxs[i]);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#114: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/unistd.h:673:
+extern long compat_call_syscall(unsigned int nr, const unsigned long *params);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
