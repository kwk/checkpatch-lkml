#32: 
The ehea busmap must be allocated only once in the first of many calls of the

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ehea_bmap)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ehea_bmap)...)
#47: FILE: drivers/net/ehea/ehea_qmr.c:599:
+		ehea_bmap = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ehea_bmap), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
