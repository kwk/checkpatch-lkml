#29: 
While it annoys even me to keep posting fixes for SD, it is nice that fixing

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#97: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1672:
+	if (current->time_slice > 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
