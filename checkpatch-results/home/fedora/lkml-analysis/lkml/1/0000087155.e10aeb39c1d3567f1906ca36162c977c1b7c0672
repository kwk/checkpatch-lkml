CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'hint < mmap_min_addr'
#49: FILE: include/linux/security.h:131:
+	if (((void *)hint != NULL) &&
+	    (hint < mmap_min_addr))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "hint"
#49: FILE: include/linux/security.h:131:
+	if (((void *)hint != NULL) &&

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: include/linux/security.h:136:
+extern int mmap_min_addr_handler(struct ctl_table *table, int write, struct file *filp,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
