CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sym"
#139: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:454:
+	if (sym == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#157: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:472:
+	struct process_kallsyms_args args = { .map = map, .dso = self, };
+	return kallsyms__parse(&args, map__process_kallsym_symbol);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
