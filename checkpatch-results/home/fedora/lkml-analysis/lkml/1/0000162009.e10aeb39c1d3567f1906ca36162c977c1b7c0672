CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:275:
+extern irqreturn_t handle_IRQ_event(unsigned int irq, struct irqaction *action);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:NEW_TYPEDEFS: do not add new typedefs
#99: FILE: include/linux/irqreturn.h:14:
+typedef enum irqreturn irqreturn_t;
