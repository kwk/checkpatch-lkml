raid10_make_request bug: can't convert block across chunks or bigger than 64k 209265151 1

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#81: FILE: drivers/md/dm-table.c:531:
+		 * bio_split() would not succeed, because bi_vcnt is 8. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
