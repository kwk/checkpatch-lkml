WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#108: FILE: drivers/pci/intr_remapping.c:29:
+extern void *__alloc_bootmem_nopanic(unsigned long size,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <irq_2_iommuX>
#137: FILE: drivers/pci/intr_remapping.c:58:
+	iommu = &irq_2_iommuX[irq_2_iommu_index];

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#148: FILE: drivers/pci/intr_remapping.c:69:
+	BUG_ON(!desc);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "valid_irq_2_iommu"
#218: FILE: drivers/pci/intr_remapping.c:132:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
