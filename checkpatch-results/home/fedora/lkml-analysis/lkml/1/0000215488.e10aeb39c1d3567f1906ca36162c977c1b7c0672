WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#44: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#49: FILE: checkpoint/Kconfig:1:
+config CHECKPOINT
+	tristate "Checkpoint & restart for containers"
+	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
+	default n
+	help
+	  This option adds module "cptrst", which allow to save a running
+	  container to a file and restart it later using this image file.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#72: FILE: checkpoint/checkpoint.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#85: FILE: checkpoint/checkpoint.h:14:
+struct cpt_operations
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#86: FILE: checkpoint/checkpoint.h:15:
+	struct module * owner;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+};
+extern struct cpt_operations cpt_ops;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#121: FILE: checkpoint/sys.c:25:
+^Ireturn -ENOSYS; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#121: FILE: checkpoint/sys.c:25:
+	return -ENOSYS; 

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/
