Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#699: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta_socket.c:1281:
+static struct dev_pm_ops yenta_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#972: FILE: include/pcmcia/ss.h:282:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

NOTE: Whitespace errors detected.
