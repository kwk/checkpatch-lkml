CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#112: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:2273:
+		rchar = wchar = syscr = syscw = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (16, 16)
#115: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:2276:
+		if (lock_task_sighand(task, &flags)) {
+		struct signal_struct *sig = task->signal;

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#192: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:2411:
+	INF("io",	S_IRUGO, tgid_io_accounting),

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
