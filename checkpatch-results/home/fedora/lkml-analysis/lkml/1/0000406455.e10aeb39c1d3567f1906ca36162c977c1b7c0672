following compiliation warning;
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#55: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/w6692.c:1015:
+		dev_w6692 = pci_get_device(id_list[id_idx].vendor_id,
 					    id_list[id_idx].device_id,

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#63: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/w6692.c:1034:
+				(W6692_SD_USR == dev_w6692->subsystem_device)) {

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#99: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/w6692.c:1097:
+	return (0);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
