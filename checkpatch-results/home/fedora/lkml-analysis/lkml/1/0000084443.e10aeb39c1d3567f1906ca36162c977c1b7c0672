CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#139: FILE: kernel/time/clocksource.c:369:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:WEAK_DECLARATION: Using weak declarations can have unintended link defects
#313: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:326:
+extern struct clocksource * __init __weak clocksource_default_clock(void);

Using weak declarations like __attribute__((weak)) or __weak
can have unintended link defects.  Avoid using them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#313: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:326:
+extern struct clocksource * __init __weak clocksource_default_clock(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
