ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#59: FILE: include/net/neighbour.h:130:
+	int			(* const output)(struct sk_buff*);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
