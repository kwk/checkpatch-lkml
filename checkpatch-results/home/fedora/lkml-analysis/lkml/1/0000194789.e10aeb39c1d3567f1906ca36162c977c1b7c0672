WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Use a single space after Tested-by:

Tested-by:  Andreas Herrmann <andreas.herrmann3@amd.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __cpuinitdata should be placed after resync_lock
#101: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tsc_sync.c:40:
+static __cpuinitdata raw_spinlock_t resync_lock = __RAW_SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#186: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tsc_sync.c:191:
+		if (cpu_can_resync() && !atomic_read(&resync_ran)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'check_tsc_sync_source', this function's name, in a string
#200: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tsc_sync.c:205:
+			mark_tsc_unstable("check_tsc_sync_source failed");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
