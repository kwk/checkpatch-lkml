CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#98: FILE: include/asm-i386/smp.h:98:
+extern int hard_smp_processor_id(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#104: FILE: include/asm-i386/smp.h:104:
+	return GET_APIC_ID(*(unsigned long *)(APIC_BASE+APIC_ID));
 	                                               ^
