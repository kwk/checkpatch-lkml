#47: 
Driver will update the OS devices after adding and deleting the device from FW.  When driver receive add or delete AEN from FW, driver will send the DCMD cmd to get the System PD list from FW.  Then driver will check if this device already in the OS: If add event and OS don't have the device (but it is in the list), driver add the device to OS, otherwise driver will not add.  If remove event, driver will check the list, if is not in the list, but OS have the device, driver will remove the device.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'megasas_service_aen', this function's name, in a string
#78: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c:1561:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "megasas_service_aen: out of memory\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#174: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c:3975:
+	if (instance->evt_detail) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
