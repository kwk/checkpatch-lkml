CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*data)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ad7142_data)...)
#411: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/ad7142.c:336:
+	data = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ad7142_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#421: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/ad7142.c:346:
+	if (client->irq > 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
