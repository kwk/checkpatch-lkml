ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#132: 
--- a/drivers/scsi/dpt_i2o.c~revert-dpt_i2o-convert-to-scsi-hotplug-model

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

#141: FILE: drivers/scsi/dpt_i2o.c:176:
+static int adpt_detect(struct scsi_host_template* sht)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
