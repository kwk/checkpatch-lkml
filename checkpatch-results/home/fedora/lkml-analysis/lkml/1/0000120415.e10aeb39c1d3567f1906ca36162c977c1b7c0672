Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u64' over 'uint64_t'
#203: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:685:
+		uint64_t ip = event->ip.ip;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#214: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:701:
+			struct map *map = thread__find_map(thread, ip);
+			if (map != NULL) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "map"
#214: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:701:
+			if (map != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
