ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#83: FILE: arch/powerpc/oprofile/cell/spu_task_sync.c:37:
+int per_cpu_buffers_exist=0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#325: FILE: drivers/oprofile/cpu_buffer.c:239:
+void oprofile_add_value(unsigned long value, int cpu) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

#326: FILE: drivers/oprofile/cpu_buffer.c:240:
+	struct oprofile_cpu_buffer * cpu_buf = &cpu_buffer[cpu];

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Do not use assignments in if condition.

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
