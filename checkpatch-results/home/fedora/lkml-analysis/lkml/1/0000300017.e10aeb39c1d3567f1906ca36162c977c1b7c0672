WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#105: FILE: fs/ocfs2/stackglue.c:229:
+	BUG_ON(lproto == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!lproto"
#105: FILE: fs/ocfs2/stackglue.c:229:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*priv)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct o2dlm_private)...)
#200: FILE: fs/ocfs2/stackglue.c:326:
+	priv = kzalloc(sizeof(struct o2dlm_private), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
