CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:65:
+extern int __freeze_processes(int sync_filesystems);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#85: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:137:
+static inline int __freeze_processes(int s) { BUG(); return 0; }

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
