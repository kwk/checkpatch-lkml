WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#68: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/early.c:170:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
