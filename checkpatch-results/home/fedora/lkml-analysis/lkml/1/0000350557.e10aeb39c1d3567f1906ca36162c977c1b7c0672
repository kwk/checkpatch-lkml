Remove the temporarily embedded task security record from task_struct.  Instead

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'appopriate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'appropriate'?
#53: 
security struct directly rather than going via the task_struct as appopriate.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#266: FILE: include/linux/key-ui.h:52:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#395: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:634:
+extern struct task_security *dup_task_security(struct task_security *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#568:

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#573: FILE: kernel/cred.c:1:
+/* Tasks security and credentials management

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#680: FILE: kernel/cred.c:108:
+	p->act_as = p->sec = sec;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#1468: FILE: security/keys/process_keys.c:266:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

#2210: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:176:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
