#42: 
I've replaced the QUIRK_COMPOSITE by a QUIRK_MIDI_FIXED_ENDPOINT, the module also probes (and fails) the USB interface 4 (I don't know what this interface is for on this device) which results in the printing of an error in the kernel log. How can I inform the snd-usb-audio driver that the USB interface 4 should be left alone?

Please find an updated (and shrinked!) patch below.
