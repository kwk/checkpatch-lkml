CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pps"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#102: FILE: drivers/pps/kapi.c:102:
+        BUG_ON(atomic_read(&pps->usage) == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#232: FILE: include/linux/pps.h:192:
+extern void pps_put_source(struct pps_device *pps);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
