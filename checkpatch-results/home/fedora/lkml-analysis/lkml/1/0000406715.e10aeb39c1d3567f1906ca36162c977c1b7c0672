WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#138: FILE: fs/ext4/extents.c:1208:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#573: FILE: include/linux/ext4_fs.h:992:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
