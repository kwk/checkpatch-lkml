Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*desc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct coh901318_desc)...)
#125: FILE: drivers/dma/coh901318.c:336:
+		desc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct coh901318_desc), GFP_NOWAIT);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
