WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#125: FILE: drivers/bluetooth/hci_ll.c:180:
+void msm_serial_clock_request_off(struct uart_port *port);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#127: FILE: drivers/bluetooth/hci_ll.c:182:
+static void __ll_msm_serial_clock_on(struct tty_struct *tty) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
