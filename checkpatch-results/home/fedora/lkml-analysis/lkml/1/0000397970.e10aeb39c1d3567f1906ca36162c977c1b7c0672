WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+    if (!p->scb_data)
     {
       scbq_init (&p->scb_data->free_scbs);
     }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#58: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx_old.c:9198:
+        else if ( (temp_p = kzalloc(sizeof(struct aic7xxx_host),$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#58: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx_old.c:9198:
+        else if ( (temp_p = kzalloc(sizeof(struct aic7xxx_host),

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#58: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx_old.c:9198:
         }
+        else if ( (temp_p = kzalloc(sizeof(struct aic7xxx_host),

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*temp_p)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct aic7xxx_host)...)
#58: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx_old.c:9198:
+        else if ( (temp_p = kzalloc(sizeof(struct aic7xxx_host),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
