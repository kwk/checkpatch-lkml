CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#101: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd.c:2166:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#103: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd.c:2168:
+		struct dasd_device *device = dasd_device_from_cdev(cdev);
+		wait_event(dasd_init_waitq, _wait_for_device(device));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
