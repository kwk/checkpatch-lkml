CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#55: FILE: linux/sched.h:1585:
+extern int pid_in_egroup_p(gid_t, pid_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'gid_t' should also have an identifier name
#55: FILE: linux/sched.h:1585:
+extern int pid_in_egroup_p(gid_t, pid_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'pid_t' should also have an identifier name
#55: FILE: linux/sched.h:1585:
+extern int pid_in_egroup_p(gid_t, pid_t);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#75: FILE: sys.c:1351:
+	if (p) {
[...]
+	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#81: FILE: sys.c:1357:
+	}
+	else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
