WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#44: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#49: FILE: mm/tlsf_int.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#77: FILE: mm/tlsf_int.h:29:
+#define NOP	do { } while(0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#86: FILE: mm/tlsf_int.h:38:
+	BUG_ON(*stat == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Messsage' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Message'?
#107: FILE: mm/tlsf_int.h:59:
+/* Messsage prefix */
    ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#121: FILE: mm/tlsf_int.h:73:
+#define MAX_SLI		(1 << MAX_LOG2_SLI)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#134: FILE: mm/tlsf_int.h:86:
+				((char *) (addr) + (r)))

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#164: FILE: mm/tlsf_int.h:116:
+^I * ^Ibit 0: block is free, if set$

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#165: FILE: mm/tlsf_int.h:117:
+^I * ^Ibit 1: previous block is free, if set$

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: struct mutex definition without comment
#185: FILE: mm/tlsf_int.h:137:
+	struct mutex lock;

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#225: FILE: mm/tlsf_int.h:177:
+};
+/*-- TLSF structures end */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
