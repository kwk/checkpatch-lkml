Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#102: FILE: net/netfilter/xt_cluster.c:64:
+	__be32 st = addr->s6_addr32[0];
+	return ((st & htonl(0xFF000000)) == htonl(0xFF000000)); 

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
