CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#88: FILE: fs/proc/stat.c:39:
+	guest = guest_nice = cputime64_zero;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#97: FILE: fs/proc/stat.c:55:
+		guest_nice = cputime64_add(guest_nice,
+			kstat_cpu(i).cpustat.guest_nice);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
