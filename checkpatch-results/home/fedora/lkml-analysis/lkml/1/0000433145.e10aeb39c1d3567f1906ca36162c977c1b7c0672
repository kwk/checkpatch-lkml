The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#171: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-landisk.c:90:
+	for (i = ret = 0; ret >= 0 && i < nr_leds; i++) {
+		ret = led_classdev_register(&pdev->dev, &landisk_leds[i]);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
