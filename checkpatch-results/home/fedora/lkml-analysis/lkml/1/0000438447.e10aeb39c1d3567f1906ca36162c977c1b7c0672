Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#178: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/kprobes.h:108:
+extern int kprobe_fault_handler(struct pt_regs *regs, int trapnr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
