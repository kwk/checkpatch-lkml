CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#42: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:25:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev"
#62: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:42:
+	no_devices = (dev == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
