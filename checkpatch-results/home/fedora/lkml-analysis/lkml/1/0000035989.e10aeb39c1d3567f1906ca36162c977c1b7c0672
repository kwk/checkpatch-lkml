WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#69: FILE: include/linux/hw_breakpoint.h:96:
+			  struct perf_event_attr *attr)	{ return -ENOSYS; }

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
