ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#94: FILE: drivers/acpi/video.c:2333:
return acpi_video_register();

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void' should also have an identifier name
#98: FILE: drivers/acpi/video.c:2335:
+void acpi_video_exit(void)

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
