CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#139: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:395:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#456: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:1235:
+static struct file_operations ftrace_notrace_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
