commit 081a5bcb39b455405d58f79bb3c9398a9d4477ed upstream

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#75: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptspi.c:1274:
+	 * if we get an ioc fault on bringup, ioc->sh will be NULL */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
