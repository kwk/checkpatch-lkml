CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <serverDomain>
#130: FILE: fs/cifs/sess.c:262:
+	ses->serverDomain = kzalloc((4 * len) + 2, GFP_KERNEL);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ses->serverDomain"
#131: FILE: fs/cifs/sess.c:263:
+	if (ses->serverDomain != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Flags2>
#145: FILE: fs/cifs/sess.c:615:
+	if (smb_buf->Flags2 & SMBFLG2_UNICODE) {

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#147: FILE: fs/cifs/sess.c:617:
+		if (((unsigned long) bcc_ptr - (unsigned long) smb_buf) % 2) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
