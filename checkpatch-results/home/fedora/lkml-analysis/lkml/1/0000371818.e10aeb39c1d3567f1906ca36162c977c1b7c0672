WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .10
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#52: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:65:
+/* Disable local APIC timer from the kernel commandline or via dmi quirk
+   or using CPU MSR check */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#52: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:65:
+   or using CPU MSR check */

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#181: FILE: drivers/i2c/algos/i2c-algo-bit.c:382:
+	const unsigned flags = msg->flags;

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'readbytes', this function's name, in a string
#222: FILE: drivers/i2c/algos/i2c-algo-bit.c:413:
+		bit_dbg(2, &i2c_adap->dev, "readbytes: 0x%02x %s\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#245: FILE: drivers/net/ppp_mppe.c:139:
+static void get_new_key_from_sha(struct ppp_mppe_state * state)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#308: FILE: drivers/net/sky2.c:838:
+	sky2->tx_prod = sky2->tx_cons = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#424: FILE: drivers/net/sky2.c:3732:
+	setup_timer(&hw->watchdog_timer, sky2_watchdog, (unsigned long) hw);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#519: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_spi.c:819:
+			 * for a transfer period that requires it */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#558: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_spi.c:878:
+	 * parameters down to required values */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!host"
#606: FILE: fs/lockd/svclock.c:378:
+	if (host == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#617: FILE: fs/lockd/svclock.c:389:
+		block = nlmsvc_create_block(rqstp, nlm_get_host(host), file,
+				lock, cookie);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!host"
#640: FILE: fs/lockd/svclock.c:488:

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
