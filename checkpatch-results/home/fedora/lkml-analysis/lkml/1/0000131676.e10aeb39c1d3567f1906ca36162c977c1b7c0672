#40: 
2.6.28-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Sg_device>
#124: FILE: drivers/scsi/sg.c:206:
+static Sg_device *sg_lookup_dev(int dev);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sfp"
#239: FILE: drivers/scsi/sg.c:1266:
+	if (WARN_ON(sfp == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#245: FILE: drivers/scsi/sg.c:1271:

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#284: FILE: drivers/scsi/sg.c:1320:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#361: FILE: drivers/scsi/sg.c:1509:

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
