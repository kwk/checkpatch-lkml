CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*th)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct thermostat)...)
#46: FILE: drivers/macintosh/therm_adt746x.c:382:
+	th = kzalloc(sizeof(struct thermostat), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
