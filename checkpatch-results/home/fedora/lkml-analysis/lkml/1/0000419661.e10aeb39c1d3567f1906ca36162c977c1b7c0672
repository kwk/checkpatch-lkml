CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#87: FILE: drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c:2776:
+	next_port = ((unsigned int) next_port %

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#114: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx4/qp.c:204:
+		qp->rq.max = qp->rq.max_gs = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#125: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx4/qp.c:212:
+		qp->rq.wqe_shift = ilog2(qp->rq.max_gs * sizeof (struct mlx4_wqe_data_seg));

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#206: FILE: drivers/net/mlx4/eq.c:500:
 static int __devinit mlx4_map_clr_int(struct mlx4_dev *dev)

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#250: FILE: drivers/net/mlx4/fw.c:496:
+		mlx4_err(dev, "Installed FW has unsupported "
+			 "command interface revision %d.\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
