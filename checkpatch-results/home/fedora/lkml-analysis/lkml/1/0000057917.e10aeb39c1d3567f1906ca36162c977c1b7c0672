CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#199: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_reg.h:1800:
+#define   DSPFW_HPLL_SR_EN	(1<<31)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+static struct intel_watermark_params g4x_wm_info = {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#259: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_display.c:2453:
+	planea_params = planeb_params = g4x_wm_info;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
