triggers because GCC does not recognize the (complex but correct) error flow

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#118: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/af9005-fe.c:223:
+	u16 uninitialized_var(loc_abort_count);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'loc_abort_count' should also have an identifier name
#118: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/af9005-fe.c:223:
+	u16 uninitialized_var(loc_abort_count);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
