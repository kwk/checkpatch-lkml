ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#122: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:80:
(c), (count))

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#147: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:82:
+extern void *__memset(void *s, char c, size_t count);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#247: FILE: arch/x86/lib/memcpy_32.c:36:
+	int d0, d1;
+	asm volatile("rep\n\t"

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
