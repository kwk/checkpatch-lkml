CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#49: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot_32.c:74:
+u16 x86_bios_cpu_apicid_init[NR_CPUS] __initdata

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
