#28: 
So we can improve the patch "http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/27/101" as following. 

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#51: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/signal_32.c:306:
+		if (onstack == 0)
[...]
+		else if (onstack == SS_ONSTACK) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#60: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/signal_32.c:315:
+				return (void __user *) -1L;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
