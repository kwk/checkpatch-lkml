CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <port_Board>
#46: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:799:
+	struct riscom_board *bp = port_Board(rp);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#66: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:809:
+	rp->xmit_cnt = rp->xmit_head = rp->xmit_tail = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <port_No>
#112: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:885:
+	bp->DTR &= ~(1u << port_No(p));

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#134: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:912:
+	return tty_port_open(&port->port, tty, filp);
