CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: include/linux/time.h:148:
+extern s64 timekeeping_max_deferment(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#167: FILE: kernel/time/tick-sched.c:281:
+		if (cpu == tick_do_timer_cpu ||
+				tick_do_timer_cpu == TICK_DO_TIMER_NONE)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#191: FILE: kernel/time/tick-sched.c:312:
+		if (likely(delta_jiffies < NEXT_TIMER_MAX_DELTA)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
