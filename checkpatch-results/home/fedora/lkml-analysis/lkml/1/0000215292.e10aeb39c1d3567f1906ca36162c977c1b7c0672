commit 5fde244d39b88625ac578d83e6625138714de031 upstream

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#80: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c:400:
+		printk(KERN_INFO"ACPI FADT declares the system doesn't support PCIe ASPM, so disable it\n");

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#80: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c:400:
+		printk(KERN_INFO"ACPI FADT declares the system doesn't support PCIe ASPM, so disable it\n");

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#117: FILE: include/linux/pci-aspm.h:30:
+extern void pcie_no_aspm(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
