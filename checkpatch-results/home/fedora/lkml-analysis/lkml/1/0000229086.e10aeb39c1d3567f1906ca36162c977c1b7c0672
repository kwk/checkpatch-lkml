WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#80: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:159:
+	pages = kmalloc(sizeof(*pages) * n_pages, GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#105: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:184:
+	if (huge->page_count) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#107: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:186:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
