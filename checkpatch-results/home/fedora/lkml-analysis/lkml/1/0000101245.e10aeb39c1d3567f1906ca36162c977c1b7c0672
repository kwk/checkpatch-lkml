WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#63: FILE: drivers/iio/accel/Kconfig:7:
+config KXSD9
+	tristate "Kionix KXSD9 Accelerometer Driver"
+	depends on IIO && SPI
+	help
+	  Say yes here to build support for the Kionix KXSD9 accelerometer.
+	  Currently this only supports the device via an SPI interface.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#86: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#91: FILE: drivers/iio/accel/kxsd9.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#236: FILE: drivers/iio/accel/kxsd9.c:146:
+	ret = strict_strtol(buf, 10, &readin);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

ERROR:NON_OCTAL_PERMISSIONS: Use 4 digit octal (0777) not decimal permissions
#318: FILE: drivers/iio/accel/kxsd9.c:228:
+static IIO_DEV_ATTR_ADC(0, kxsd9_read_accel, KXSD9_REG_AUX);
Permission bits should use 4 digit octal permissions (like 0700 or 0444).
Avoid using any other base like decimal.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#319: FILE: drivers/iio/accel/kxsd9.c:229:
+static IIO_DEV_ATTR_ACCEL_SET_RANGE(S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#386: FILE: drivers/iio/accel/kxsd9.c:296:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
