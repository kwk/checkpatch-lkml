WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#113: FILE: fs/inode.c:129:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#195: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:50:
+extern int get_nr_inodes(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
