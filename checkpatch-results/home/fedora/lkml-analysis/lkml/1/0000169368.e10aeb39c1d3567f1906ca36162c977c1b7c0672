Subject: [PATCH] ide: keep track of number of bytes instead of sectors in struct ide_cmd

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#104: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:246:
+	cmd->nbytes = cmd->nleft = nr_bytes;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ide_cmd *' should also have an identifier name
#229: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1409:
+void ide_init_sg_cmd(struct ide_cmd *, unsigned int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name
#229: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1409:
+void ide_init_sg_cmd(struct ide_cmd *, unsigned int);
