WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'cas_change_mtu', this function's name, in a string
#689: FILE: drivers/net/cassini.c:3905:
+	pr_err("reset called in cas_change_mtu\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

 		dev_err(&pdev->dev, "Cannot find proper PCI device "
+		       "base address, aborting\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
