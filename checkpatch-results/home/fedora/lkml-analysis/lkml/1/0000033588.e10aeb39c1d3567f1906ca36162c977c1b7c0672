^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)

requested by "ondemand". The "conservative" governor already has this check: 

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#81: 
# diff -bur ./drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c.orig ./drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.
