CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#81: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:2837:
+	uint32_t old_write_domain, old_read_domains;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!obj_priv->gtt_space"
#85: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:2841:
+	if (obj_priv->gtt_space == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#94: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:2850:
+		DRM_INFO("%s: object %p wait for seqno %08x\n",
+			  __func__, obj, obj_priv->last_rendering_seqno);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#111: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:2867:
+	BUG_ON((obj->write_domain & ~I915_GEM_DOMAIN_GTT) != 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
