Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#109: FILE: arch/x86/pci/common.c:177:
+static void __devinit pcibios_fixup_bus_resources(struct pci_bus *bus)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#192: FILE: arch/x86/pci/pci.h:121:
+extern int pcibios_resource_needs_fixup(struct pci_dev *dev, int resno);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
