CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#79: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:44:
+			desc->a = desc->b = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#107: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:150:
+	int n = GDT_ENTRY_TLS_ENTRIES;
+	while (n > 0 && desc_empty(&t->tls_array[n - 1]))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
