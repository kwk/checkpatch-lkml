this on the upstream kernel, but since the issue occurs very rarelly

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#128: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp.c:345:
+	/* Get in sync with tcp_data_queue, tcp_urg
+	   and tcp_rcv_established function. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#169: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:5326:
+			else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
