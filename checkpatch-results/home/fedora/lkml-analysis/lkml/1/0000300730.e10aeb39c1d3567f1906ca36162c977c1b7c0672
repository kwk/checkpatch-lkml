ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo** bar" should be "foo **bar"
#50: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/main.c:116:
+static char** dup_argv(int argc, char **argv)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#72: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/main.c:140:
+	int i;
+	for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#72: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/main.c:140:
+	for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
+		free(argv[i]);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
