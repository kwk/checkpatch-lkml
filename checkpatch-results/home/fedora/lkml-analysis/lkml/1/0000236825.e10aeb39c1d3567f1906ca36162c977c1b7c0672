WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#70: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:471:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL    (pv_hotplug_ops);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+#ifdef CONFIG_PARAVIRT

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name
#187: FILE: include/asm-x86/paravirt.h:338:
+	void (*cpu_die)(unsigned int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
