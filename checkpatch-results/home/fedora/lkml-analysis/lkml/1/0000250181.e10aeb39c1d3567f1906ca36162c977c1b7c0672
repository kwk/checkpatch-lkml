WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#82: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#87: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/debugfs.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: static const char * array should probably be static const char * const
#108: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/debugfs.c:22:

WARNING:PREFER_SEQ_PUTS: Prefer seq_puts to seq_printf
#134: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/debugfs.c:48:
+		seq_printf(s, "(1.65 - 1.95 V)\n");

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#136: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/debugfs.c:50:

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#138: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/debugfs.c:52:

WARNING:PREFER_SEQ_PUTS: Prefer seq_puts to seq_printf
#140: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/debugfs.c:54:

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#230: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/debugfs.c:144:
+		 * create the directory. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0400'.
#235: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/debugfs.c:149:
+	if (!debugfs_create_file("ios", S_IRUSR, root, host, &mmc_ios_fops))

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
