CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: include/linux/dma-debug.h:79:
+extern void debug_dma_dump_mappings(struct device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTF_L: %Lx is non-standard C, use %llx
