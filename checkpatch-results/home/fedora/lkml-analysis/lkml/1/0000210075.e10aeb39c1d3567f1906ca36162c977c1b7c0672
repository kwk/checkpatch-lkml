Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#155: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/ftrace.h:22:
+extern void ftrace_nmi_enter(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#225: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/ftrace.c:105:

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#283: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/ftrace.c:163:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
