Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#118: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:133:
+			list_add_tail(&child->node,
+						&dev->bus->children);

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#133: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:148:
+			dev_err(&dev->dev, "Error registering pci_bus,"
+				" continuing...\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#134: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:149:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
