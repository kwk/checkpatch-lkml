ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#76: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:200:
+struct printk_ratelimit_state
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#85: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:209:
+extern int __printk_ratelimit(int ratelimit_jiffies,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ratelimit_burst);

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'state->limit_jiffies != ratelimit_jiffies'
#157: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1255:
+	if ((state->limit_jiffies != ratelimit_jiffies) ||

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#168: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1266:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
