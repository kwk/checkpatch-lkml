WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#68: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#73: FILE: include/asm-microblaze/delay.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#74: FILE: include/asm-microblaze/delay.h:2:
+ * include/asm-microblaze/delay.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '__delay', this function's name, in a string
#90: FILE: include/asm-microblaze/delay.h:18:
+	asm volatile ("# __delay		\n\t"		\

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:QUOTED_WHITESPACE_BEFORE_NEWLINE: unnecessary whitespace before a quoted newline
#90: FILE: include/asm-microblaze/delay.h:18:
+	asm volatile ("# __delay		\n\t"		\

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
