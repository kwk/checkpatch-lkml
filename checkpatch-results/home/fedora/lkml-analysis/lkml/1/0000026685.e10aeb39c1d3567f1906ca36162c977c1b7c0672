#42: 
The VM_IOREMAP check is introduced in commit d0107eb07320b for per-cpu

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#201: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:1684:
+	BUG_ON(count > PAGE_SIZE - offset);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'calles' may be misspelled - perhaps 'calls'?
