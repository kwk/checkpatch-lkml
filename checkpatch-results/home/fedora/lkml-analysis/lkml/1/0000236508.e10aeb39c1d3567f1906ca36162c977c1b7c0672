#31: 
Add the new play_dead into smpboot.c, as it fits more cleanly in there alongside other CONFIG_HOTPLUG functions.

WARNING:MEMORY_BARRIER: memory barrier without comment
#136: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:1409:
+	mb();

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#162: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:1439:
+	BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
