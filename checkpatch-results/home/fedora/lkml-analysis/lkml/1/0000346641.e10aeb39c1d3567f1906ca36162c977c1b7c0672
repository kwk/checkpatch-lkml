WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#45: FILE: fs/udf/dir.c:68:
+	fibh.soffset = fibh.eoffset =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#64: FILE: fs/udf/dir.c:83:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#69: FILE: fs/udf/dir.c:86:
+		fibh.sbh = fibh.ebh = udf_tread(dir->i_sb, block);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#84: FILE: fs/udf/dir.c:101:
+				if (tmp && !buffer_uptodate(tmp) &&
+					!buffer_locked(tmp))

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#96: FILE: fs/udf/dir.c:135:
+		else {

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <fileIdentDesc>
#100: FILE: fs/udf/dir.c:138:
+			poffset = fibh.soffset + sizeof(struct fileIdentDesc) +

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
