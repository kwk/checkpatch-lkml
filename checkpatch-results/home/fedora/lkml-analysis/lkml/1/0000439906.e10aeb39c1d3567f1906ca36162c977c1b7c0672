CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#73: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/chp.c:504:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#442: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/chsc.h:39:
+extern void chsc_process_crw(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#683: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.h:149:
+extern void css_process_crw(int, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#729: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/idset.c:2:
+ *  drivers/s390/cio/idset.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/bitops.h> instead of <asm/bitops.h>

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*set)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct idset)...)
#755: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/idset.c:28:
+	set = kzalloc(sizeof(struct idset) + bitmap_size(num_ssid, num_id),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
