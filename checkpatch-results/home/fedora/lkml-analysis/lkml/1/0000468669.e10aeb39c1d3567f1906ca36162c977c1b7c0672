#30: 
> Remove this parameter, and rename the function to cancel_rearming_delayed_work().

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:205:
+extern void cancel_rearming_delayed_work(struct delayed_work *work);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#73: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:210:
+void cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue(struct workqueue_struct *wq,
+					struct delayed_work *work)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cwq"
#107: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:569:
+	if (cwq != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
