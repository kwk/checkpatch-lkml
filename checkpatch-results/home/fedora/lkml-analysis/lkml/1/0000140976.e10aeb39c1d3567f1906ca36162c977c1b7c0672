WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#119: FILE: arch/arm/mm/fault.c:211:
+	fault = handle_mm_fault(mm, vma, addr & PAGE_MASK, (fsr & (1 << 11)) ? FAULT_FLAG_WRITE : 0);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
