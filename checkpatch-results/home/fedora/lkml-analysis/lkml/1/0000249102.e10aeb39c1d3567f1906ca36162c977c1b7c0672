CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: include/net/ipv6.h:611:
+extern int ipv6_static_sysctl_register(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#184: FILE: net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c:159:
+	static struct ctl_table empty[1];
+	ip6_base = register_net_sysctl_rotable(net_ipv6_ctl_path, empty);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ip6_base"
#185: FILE: net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c:160:
+	if (ip6_base == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
