CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!fd"
#76: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:220:
+	if (fd == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!fgets"
#104: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:231:
+		if (fgets(bf, sizeof(bf), fp) == NULL)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#109: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:236:
+			char *name = bf + 5;
+			while (*name && isspace(*name))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#115: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:242:
+			char *tgids = bf + 5;
+			while (*tgids && isspace(*tgids))

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#117: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:244:
+			tgid = comm_ev.pid = atoi(tgids);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#188: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:576:
+		pid_t tgid = pid_synthesize_comm_event(pid, 0);
