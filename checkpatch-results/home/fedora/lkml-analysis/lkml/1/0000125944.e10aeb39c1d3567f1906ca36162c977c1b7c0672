CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/tlbflush.h:136:
+extern void init_smp_flush(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!f->flush_mm"
#103: FILE: arch/x86/mm/tlb.c:150:
+	if (f->flush_mm == NULL ||

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#112: FILE: arch/x86/mm/tlb.c:159:
+		if (f->flush_mm == NULL)
[...]
+		else if (tlbstate == TLBSTATE_OK) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
