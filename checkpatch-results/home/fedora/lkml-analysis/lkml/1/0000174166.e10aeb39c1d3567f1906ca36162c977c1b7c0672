Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
