CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#61: FILE: include/linux/ftrace.h:77:
+extern int skip_trace(unsigned long ip);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#94: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:201:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
