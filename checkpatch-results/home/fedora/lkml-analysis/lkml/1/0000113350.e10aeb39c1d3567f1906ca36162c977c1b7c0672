CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1120:
+extern int ext4_alloc_da_blocks(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'becuase' may be misspelled - perhaps 'because'?
#116: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:2850:
+	 * simplifying them becuase we wouldn't actually intend to
 	                    ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#139: FILE: fs/ext4/ioctl.c:268:
+		int err;
+		if (!is_owner_or_cap(inode))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
