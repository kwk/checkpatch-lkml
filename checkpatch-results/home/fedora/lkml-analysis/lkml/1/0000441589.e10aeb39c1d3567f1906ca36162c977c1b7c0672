#171: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:822:
+extern void sched_setup_account(struct sched_account *account, u64 price);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#318: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:24:
+unsigned int sysctl_sched_economy = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
