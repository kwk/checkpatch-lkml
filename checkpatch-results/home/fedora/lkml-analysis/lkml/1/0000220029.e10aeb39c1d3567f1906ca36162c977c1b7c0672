CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!nlh"
#101: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c:2487:
+	if (nlh == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#105: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c:2491:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!skb"
#131: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c:2517:
+	if (skb == NULL)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#135: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c:2521:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
