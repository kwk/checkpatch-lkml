I would rather see the text in Documentation/spinlocks give an explaination

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#56: 
--- a/Documentation/spinlocks.txt	2009-11-10 17:47:03.801984416 -0800

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
