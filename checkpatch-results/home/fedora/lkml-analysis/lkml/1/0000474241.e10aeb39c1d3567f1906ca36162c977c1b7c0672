Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#93: FILE: drivers/input/input.c:499:
+static struct seq_operations input_activity_seq_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
