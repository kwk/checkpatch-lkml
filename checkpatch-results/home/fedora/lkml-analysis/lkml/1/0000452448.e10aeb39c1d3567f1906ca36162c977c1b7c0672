Subject: [patch 3/3] update ctime and mtime for mmaped write
                                                ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#143: FILE: mm/memory.c:1526:
+		struct address_space *mapping = page_mapping(page);
+		if (mapping)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#275: FILE: mm/rmap.c:521:
+	BUG_ON(!mapping);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#286: FILE: mm/rmap.c:532:
+			if (addr != -EFAULT &&

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#433: FILE: mm/msync.c:61:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
