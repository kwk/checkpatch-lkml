CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: include/linux/skbuff.h:908:
+extern unsigned char *skb_push(struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '<' (ctx:VxV)
