Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+#undef K

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
