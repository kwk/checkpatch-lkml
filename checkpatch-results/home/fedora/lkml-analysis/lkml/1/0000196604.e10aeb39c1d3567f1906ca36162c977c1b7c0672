CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: include/net/af_unix.h:12:
+extern void wait_for_unix_gc(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to false
#121: FILE: net/unix/garbage.c:271:
+static bool gc_in_progress = false;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:BOOL_COMPARISON: Using comparison to false is error prone
#127: FILE: net/unix/garbage.c:275:
+	wait_event(unix_gc_wait, gc_in_progress == false);

Comparisons of A to true and false are better written
as A and !A.
