WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#121: FILE: include/net/net_namespace.h:110:
+extern struct net *net_create(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#306: FILE: net/core/net_namespace.c:1:
+/* Copyright (C) 2000-2009 Parallels Holdings, Ltd. */

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#360: FILE: net/core/net_namespace.c:536:
+			pr_err("net_ns %p has external references %lu:%u\n", net_ns, obj->o_count, cnt);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 123 exceeds 100 columns

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#418: FILE: net/core/net_namespace.c:594:
+	pr_debug("restore net_ns %p: ref {%llu, %u}, rv %d\n", net_ns, (unsigned long long)ref->pos, ref->id, rv);

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#423: FILE: net/core/net_namespace.c:599:
