Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct perf_pending_entry *' should also have an identifier name
#70: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:326:
+	void (*func)(struct perf_pending_entry *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cmpxchg"
#123: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1612:
+	if (cmpxchg(&entry->next, NULL, PENDING_TAIL) != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct perf_pending_entry *' should also have an identifier name
#155: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1635:
+		void (*func)(struct perf_pending_entry *);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!counter->pending.next"
#180: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1671:
+	return counter->pending.next == NULL;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#191: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1708:
+	if (handle->nmi) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
