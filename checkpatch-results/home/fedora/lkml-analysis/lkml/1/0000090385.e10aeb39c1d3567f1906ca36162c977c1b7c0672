#36: 
Adds a read-only "procs" file similar to "tasks" that shows only unique tgids

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#98: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:194:
+	 * and one for tgids (the procs file). */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around cgrp->tasks.mutex
#112: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:963:
+	init_rwsem(&(cgrp->tasks.mutex));

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#222: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2188:
+	array = kmalloc(length * sizeof(pid_t), GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#302: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2300:
+			if (l->list[mid] == pid) {
[...]
-			} else if (cgrp->tasks_pids[mid] <= pid)
[...]
 				index = mid + 1;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#329: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2321:
+	struct cgroup_pidlist *l = s->private;
+	up_read(&l->mutex);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#381: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2361:
+	BUG_ON(!l->use_count);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#517: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2467:
+		.mode = S_IRUGO,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
