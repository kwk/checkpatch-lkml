Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
