CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#108: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:715:
+	hwif->data_phase = task.data_phase = TASKFILE_NO_DATA;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#175: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#180: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-park.c:1:
+#include <linux/kernel.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'reenabled' may be misspelled - perhaps 're-enabled'?
#224: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-park.c:45:
+	 * timeout has expired, so power management will be reenabled.
 	                                                    ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_INT: Prefer 'long' over 'long int' as the int is unnecessary
#264: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-park.c:85:
+	long int input;

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#267: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-park.c:88:
+	rc = strict_strtol(buf, 10, &input);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#332: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:157:
+		if (tf->lbal != 0xc4) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#333: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:158:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "%s: head unload failed!\n",

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
