CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#83: FILE: include/linux/mempolicy.h:28:
+#define MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES	(1 << 14)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#109: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:146:
+	nodemask_t tmp;
+	nodes_fold(tmp, *orig, nodes_weight(*rel));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
