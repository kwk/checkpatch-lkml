#33: 
Pass the buffer size for (most) ptrace commands that pass user-allocated buffers and check that size before accessing the buffer. Unfortunately, PTRACE_BTS_GET already uses all 4 parameters.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#139: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/ptrace.c:978:
+			(child, data, (struct bts_struct __user *) addr);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#162: FILE: include/asm-x86/ptrace-abi.h:109:
+/* Return the current configuration in a struct ptrace_bts_config
+   pointed to by ADDR; DATA gives the size of that buffer.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
