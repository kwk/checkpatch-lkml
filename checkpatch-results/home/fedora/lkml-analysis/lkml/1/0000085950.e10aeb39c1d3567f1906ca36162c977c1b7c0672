Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
