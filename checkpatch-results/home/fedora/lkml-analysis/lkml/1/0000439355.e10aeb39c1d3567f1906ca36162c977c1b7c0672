WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments

### race 1

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)

### race 2

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#291: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:250:
+	dir->i_ctime = dir->i_mtime = curtime;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'bye'
#306: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:265:
+	/* bye bye */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#341: FILE: fs/sysfs/sysfs.h:79:
+extern void sysfs_drop_dentry(struct sysfs_dirent *sd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
