# tracer: function_graph

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'threshhold' may be misspelled - perhaps 'threshold'?
#114: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:384:

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#114: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:384:
+	ret = strict_strtoul(str, 0, &threshhold);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo __read_mostly	bar" should be "foo __read_mostly bar"
#129: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:597:
+unsigned long __read_mostly	tracing_thresh;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
