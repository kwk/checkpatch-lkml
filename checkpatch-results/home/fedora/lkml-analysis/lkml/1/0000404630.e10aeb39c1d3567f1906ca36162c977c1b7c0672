CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "p"
#249: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_mc.c:363:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
