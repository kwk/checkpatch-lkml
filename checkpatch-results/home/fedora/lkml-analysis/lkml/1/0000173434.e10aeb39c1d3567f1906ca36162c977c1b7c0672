WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#86: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:243:
+	BUG_ON(!net);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#141: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:1466:

+					int fd, u16 tunnel_id, int *error)

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#214: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:2418:
+	if (list_is_last(&curr->list, &pn->pppol2tp_tunnel_list)) {
 		goto out;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#242: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:2443:
+			pd->tunnel = list_entry(pn->pppol2tp_tunnel_list.next, struct pppol2tp_tunnel, list);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#317: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:2659:
+	pde = proc_net_fops_create(net, "pppol2tp", S_IRUGO, &pppol2tp_proc_fops);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __net_initdata should be placed after pppol2tp_net_ops
#346: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:2688:
+static __net_initdata struct pernet_operations pppol2tp_net_ops = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
