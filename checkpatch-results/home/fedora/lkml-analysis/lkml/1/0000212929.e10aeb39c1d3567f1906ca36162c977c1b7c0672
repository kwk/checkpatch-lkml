WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after bad_bios_dmi_table[]
#70: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup.c:773:
+static struct dmi_system_id __initdata bad_bios_dmi_table[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
