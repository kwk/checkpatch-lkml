Although slighly different, the tss_struct is very similar in x86_64 and
         ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#96: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup64.c:261:
+		orig_ist->ist[v] = t->x86_tss.ist[v] = (unsigned long)estacks;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
