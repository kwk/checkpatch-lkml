WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#30: 
#echo "major:minor weight" > blkio.policy

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "p"
#134: FILE: block/blk-cgroup.c:255:
+	if (p != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#144: FILE: block/blk-cgroup.c:265:
+	ret = strict_strtoul(major_s, 10, &major);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'deleteing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'deleting'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#380: FILE: block/blk-cgroup.h:55:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
