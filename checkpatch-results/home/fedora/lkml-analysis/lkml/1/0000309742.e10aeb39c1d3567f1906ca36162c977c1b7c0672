#27: 
Move the unchanged definition of __group_complete_signal() so that send_signal

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#71: FILE: kernel/signal.c:688:
+	if (wants_signal(sig, p))
[...]
+	else if (thread_group_empty(p))
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
