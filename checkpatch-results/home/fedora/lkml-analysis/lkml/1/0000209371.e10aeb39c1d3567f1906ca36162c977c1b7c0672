CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#46: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/fixmap_64.h:75:
+extern void reserve_top_address(unsigned long reserve);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#69: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pgtable.c:326:
+	BUG_ON(fixmaps_set > 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
