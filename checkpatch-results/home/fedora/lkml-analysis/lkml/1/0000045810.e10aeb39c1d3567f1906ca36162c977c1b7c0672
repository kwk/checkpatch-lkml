#35: 
unregistering that module as a user of the facility.  This prevents the put_ref

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#200: FILE: include/linux/slow-work.h:91:
+extern int slow_work_register_user(struct module *owner);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#319: FILE: kernel/slow-work.c:421:
+	BUG_ON(id < 0 || id >= SLOW_WORK_THREAD_LIMIT);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
