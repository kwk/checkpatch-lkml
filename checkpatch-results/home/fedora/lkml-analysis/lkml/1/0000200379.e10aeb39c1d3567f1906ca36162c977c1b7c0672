Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#215: FILE: mount/lomount.c:1006:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#249: FILE: mount/lomount.c:1056:
+	assoc = offset = sizelimit = encryption = passfd = grow = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#276: FILE: mount/lomount.c:1126:
+		if (all || assoc || find
+		    || (argc != 4 && argc != 5))

WARNING:SSCANF_TO_KSTRTO: Prefer kstrto<type> to single variable sscanf
#285: FILE: mount/lomount.c:1139:
+	if (grow && sscanf(grow, "%llu", &new_size) != 1)
+		usage();
