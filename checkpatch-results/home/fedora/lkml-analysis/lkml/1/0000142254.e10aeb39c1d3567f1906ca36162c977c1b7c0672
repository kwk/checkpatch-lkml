CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#159: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:552:
+extern void perf_swcounter_event(u32, u64, int, struct pt_regs *, u64);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
