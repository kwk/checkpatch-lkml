CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#130: FILE: include/asm-generic/bitops/le.h:47:
+extern unsigned long generic_find_next_le_bit(const unsigned long *addr,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#131: FILE: include/asm-generic/bitops/le.h:48:
+extern unsigned long generic_find_next_le_bit(const unsigned long *addr,
+		unsigned long size, unsigned long offset);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#143: FILE: include/asm-m68k/bitops.h:413:
 }
+#define ext2_find_next_bit(addr, size, off) \

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
