WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#314: FILE: drivers/staging/rtl8192su/ieee80211/ieee80211_softmac.c:519:
       			if (!channel_map[ieee->current_network.channel]);
 				ieee->current_network.channel = 6;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
