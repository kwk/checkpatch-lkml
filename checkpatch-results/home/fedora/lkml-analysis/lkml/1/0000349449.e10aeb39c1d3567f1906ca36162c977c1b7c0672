Subject: [PATCH] rawmidi: let sparse know what is going on _for real_

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

#108: FILE: sound/core/rawmidi.c:1145:
+	snd_assert(kernelbuf != NULL || userbuf != NULL, return -EINVAL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
