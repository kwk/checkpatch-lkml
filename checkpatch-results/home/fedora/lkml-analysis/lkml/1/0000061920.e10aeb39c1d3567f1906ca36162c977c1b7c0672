CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#96: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2322:
+	rq = orig_rq = task_rq_lock(p, &flags);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
