CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'nr_reclaimable > background_thresh'
#236: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:532:
+	if (!laptop_mode && (nr_reclaimable > background_thresh))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#264: FILE: include/linux/backing-dev.h:108:
+#define DIRTY_THROTTLE_PAGES_STOP	(1 << 22)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "tt"
#381: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:351:
+	return tt != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
