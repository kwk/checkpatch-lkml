CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'free_blocks < windowsz'
#85: FILE: fs/ext4/balloc.c:1814:
+		if (my_rsv && (free_blocks < windowsz)
+			&& (rsv_is_empty(&my_rsv->rsv_window)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#86: FILE: fs/ext4/balloc.c:1815:

+			&& (rsv_is_empty(&my_rsv->rsv_window)))

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
