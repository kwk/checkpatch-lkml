#34: 
procfs_read_inode() into procfs_get_inode(), and have that call iget_locked()

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#93: FILE: fs/proc/inode.c:409:
+		inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#109: FILE: fs/proc/inode.c:425:
+				if (S_ISREG(inode->i_mode)) {
[...]
+					else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#123: FILE: fs/proc/inode.c:434:
+				}
+				else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
