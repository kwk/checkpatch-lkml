ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#45: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:211:
+int i8042_command(unsigned char *param, int command)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
