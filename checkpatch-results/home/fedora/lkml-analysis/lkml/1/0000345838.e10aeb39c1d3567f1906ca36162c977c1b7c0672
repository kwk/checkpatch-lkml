CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#229: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-acpi.c:389:
+	out_obj = dev->gtf_cache = output.pointer;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
