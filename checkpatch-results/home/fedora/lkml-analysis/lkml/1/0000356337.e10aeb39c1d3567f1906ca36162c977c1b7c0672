WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'initalization' may be misspelled - perhaps 'initialization'?

The current PLL initalization has a number of deficiencies:
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#141: FILE: drivers/crypto/hifn_795x.c:924:
+	if (hifn_pll_ref[3] != '\0')
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#142: FILE: drivers/crypto/hifn_795x.c:925:
+		freq = simple_strtoul(hifn_pll_ref + 3, NULL, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
