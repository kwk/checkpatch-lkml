WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#33: 
o For io scheduler noop, deadline and AS, we maintain only one ioq per group.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#74: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:913:
+		queue_charge = group_charge = allocated_slice;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#181: FILE: block/elevator-fq.h:246:
+					   * time slice length */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
