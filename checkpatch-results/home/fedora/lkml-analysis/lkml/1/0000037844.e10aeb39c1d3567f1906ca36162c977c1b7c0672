CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#163: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:286:
+		if (len < res)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#165: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:288:
+		else {

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#171: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:293:
+							buffer+res, len, 0);
 							      ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#193: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:832:
+extern int access_process_vm_locked(struct task_struct *tsk, struct mm_struct *mm,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
