The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of

constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Exporting world writable sysfs/debugfs files is usually a bad thing.
When done arbitrarily they can introduce serious security bugs.
In the past, some of the debugfs vulnerabilities would seemingly allow
any local user to write arbitrary values into device registers - a
situation from which little good can be expected to emerge.
