Subject: [PATCH] Create 'slot' sysfs attribute in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/topology/

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
#172: FILE: drivers/base/topology.c:63:
+#define ref_slot_attr			&attr_slot.attr,

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#196: FILE: include/asm-ia64/cpu.h:17:
+extern void arch_set_topology_slot(int num, u32 slot);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
#247: FILE: include/asm-ia64/topology.h:120:
+#define arch_set_topology_slot(num, slot)	ia64_set_topology_slot(num,slot)
                                          	                          ^
