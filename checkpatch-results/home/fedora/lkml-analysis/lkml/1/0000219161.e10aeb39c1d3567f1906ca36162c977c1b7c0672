WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#87: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3212:
+	int group_capacity = gl->group->__cpu_power / SCHED_LOAD_SCALE;
+	sdl->max_load = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#89: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3214:
+	if (gl->local_group)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
