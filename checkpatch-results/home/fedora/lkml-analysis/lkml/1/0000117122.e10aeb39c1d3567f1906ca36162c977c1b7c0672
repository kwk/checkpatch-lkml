CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#50: FILE: security/tomoyo/common.c:924:
+		const struct tomoyo_path_info *new_comment
+			= tomoyo_get_name(cp + 1);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#52: FILE: security/tomoyo/common.c:926:
+		const struct tomoyo_path_info *old_comment;
+		old_comment = profile->comment;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
