WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'platfrom' may be misspelled - perhaps 'platform'?
#42: 
	all platform devices pass its platfrom data from
	                              ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#95: FILE: include/linux/device.h:388:
+	void		*platform_data;	/* Platform specific data, device

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
