ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#114: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1328:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#184: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1431:
+	disk = lo->lo_disk = alloc_disk(1);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#238: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1474:
+	if ((lo = loop_find_dev(number)) == NULL) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#274: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1490:
+	blk_register_region(MKDEV(LOOP_MAJOR, 0), 1UL << MINORBITS,
+				  THIS_MODULE, loop_probe, NULL, NULL);
