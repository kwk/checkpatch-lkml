CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#69: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:3332:
+	old = val = atomic64_read(&hwc->period_left);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#249: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:3576:
+	if ((counter->attr.exclude_kernel || !data.regs) &&
+			!counter->attr.exclude_user)
