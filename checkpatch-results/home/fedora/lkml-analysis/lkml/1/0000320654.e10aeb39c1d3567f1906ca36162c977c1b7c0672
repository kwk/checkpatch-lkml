#30: 
hw.c:3754:10: warning: cast truncates bits from constant value (ffffffea becomes 0)

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ath5k_hw *' should also have an identifier name
#51: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ath5k/ath5k.h:1038:
+	int (*ah_setup_xtx_desc)(struct ath5k_hw *, struct ath5k_desc *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
