CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!acard->mpu"
#154: FILE: sound/isa/cmi8330.c:341:
+	if (acard->mpu == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#200: FILE: sound/oss/mpu401.c:939:
+	if ((tmp = mpu_cmd(n, 0xAD, 0)) < 0) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#533: FILE: sound/pci/hda/patch_analog.c:814:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
