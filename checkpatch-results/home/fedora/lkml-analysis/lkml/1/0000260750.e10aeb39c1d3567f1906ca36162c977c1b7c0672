#38: 
kva ram already mapped right after away, so don't need to get that for low ram.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#60: FILE: arch/x86/mm/discontig_32.c:161:
+	if (node_has_online_mem(nid) && node_remap_start_vaddr[nid])
[...]
 	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#66: FILE: arch/x86/mm/discontig_32.c:166:

 				               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
