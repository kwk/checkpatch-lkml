Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#89: FILE: char/tty_io.c:2525:
+        /* in case of resize ioctl on slave */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'tty == real_tty'
#90: FILE: char/tty_io.c:2526:
+	if ((tty == real_tty) && (tty->driver->type == TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_PTY))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#92: FILE: char/tty_io.c:2528:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open brace '{'
#117: FILE: char/tty_io.c:2534:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#119: FILE: char/tty_io.c:2536:

+		 avoid holding the tty ctrl lock while sending signals */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
