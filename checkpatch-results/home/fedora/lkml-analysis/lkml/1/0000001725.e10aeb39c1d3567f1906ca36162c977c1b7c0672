So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#46: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/xen/cpuid.h:1:
+/******************************************************************************

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#111: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/xen/cpuid.h:66:
+#define XEN_CPUID_FEAT1_MMU_PT_UPDATE_PRESERVE_AD  (1u<<0)
                                                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#111: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/xen/cpuid.h:66:
+#define XEN_CPUID_FEAT1_MMU_PT_UPDATE_PRESERVE_AD  (1u<<0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
