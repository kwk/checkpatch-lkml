CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/i387.h:175:
+extern void finit_task(struct task_struct *tsk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#88: FILE: arch/x86/math-emu/fpu_aux.c:37:
+	struct address *oaddr, *iaddr;
+	soft->cwd = 0x037f;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
