WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#73: FILE: arch/powerpc/mm/pgtable_32.c:68:
+extern phys_addr_t v_mapped_by_tlbcam(unsigned long va);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns
#259: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/systbls.S:59:
+/*190*/	.word sys32_init_module, sys_sparc64_personality, sys_remap_file_pages, sys32_epoll_create, sys32_epoll_ctl

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#592: FILE: drivers/net/tun.c:161:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#986: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:1357:
+	if (linear) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#990: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:1361:
+	} else

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!np->cork.opt"
#1296: FILE: net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1148:
+			if (unlikely(np->cork.opt == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:WxV)
#1366: FILE: net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_icmpv6.c:53:
+	[ICMPV6_NI_REPLY - 128]		= ICMPV6_NI_QUERY +1

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: struct mutex definition without comment
#1412: FILE: net/packet/af_packet.c:179:
+	struct mutex		pg_vec_lock;

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#1484: FILE: net/sctp/output.c:327:
+		if (SCTP_XMIT_OK != retval)

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.
