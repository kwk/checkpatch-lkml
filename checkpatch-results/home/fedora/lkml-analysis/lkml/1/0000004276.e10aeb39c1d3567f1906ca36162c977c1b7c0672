CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cohd"
#90: FILE: drivers/dma/coh901318.c:576:
+	if (cohd != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#137: FILE: drivers/dma/coh901318.c:676:
+		dev_err(COHC_2_DEV(cohc), "spurious interrupt from "
+			"unallocated channel\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#152: FILE: drivers/dma/coh901318.c:691:
+	BUG_ON(list_empty(&cohc->active));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
