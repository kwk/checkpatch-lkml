ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to false
#114: FILE: arch/arm/mach-mx3/devices.c:224:
+static bool ipu_registered = false;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#144: FILE: arch/arm/mach-mx3/devices.c:254:
+		int ret = platform_device_register(&mx3_ipu);
+		if (ret < 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
