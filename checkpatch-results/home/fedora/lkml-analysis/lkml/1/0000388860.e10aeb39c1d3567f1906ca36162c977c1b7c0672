ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#96: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:166:
+static ATOMIC_NOTIFIER_HEAD(keyboard_notifier_list); $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#127: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:1229:
+	param.shift = shift_final = (shift_state | kbd->slockstate) ^ kbd->lockstate;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#131: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:1232:
+	if (atomic_notifier_call_chain(&keyboard_notifier_list, KBD_KEYCODE, &param) == NOTIFY_STOP || !key_map) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#198: FILE: include/linux/keyboard.h:39:
+extern int register_keyboard_notifier(struct notifier_block *nb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#212: FILE: include/linux/notifier.h:236:
+ * KBD_KEYSYM. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
