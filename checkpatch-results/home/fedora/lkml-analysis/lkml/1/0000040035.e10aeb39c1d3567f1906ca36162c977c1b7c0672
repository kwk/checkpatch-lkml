CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#64: FILE: fs/notify/fsnotify.h:28:
+extern int fsnotify_add_vfsmount_mark(struct fsnotify_mark *mark,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#75: FILE: fs/notify/fsnotify.h:40:
+extern void fsnotify_destroy_vfsmount_mark(struct fsnotify_mark *mark);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#105: FILE: fs/notify/mark.c:135:
+	if (mark->flags & FSNOTIFY_MARK_FLAG_INODE) {
[...]
+	} else if (mark->flags & FSNOTIFY_MARK_FLAG_VFSMOUNT)
[...]
 	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#144:

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#149: FILE: fs/notify/vfsmount_mark.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#164: FILE: fs/notify/vfsmount_mark.c:16:
+ *  the Free Software Foundation, 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
