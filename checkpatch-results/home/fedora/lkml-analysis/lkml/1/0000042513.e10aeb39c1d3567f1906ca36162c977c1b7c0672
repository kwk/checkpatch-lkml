The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.
