CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "rcu_dereference_raw"
#53: FILE: fs/file.c:481:
+	if (rcu_dereference_raw(fdt->fd[fd]) != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'files' - possible side-effects?
#98: FILE: include/linux/fdtable.h:60:
+#define files_fdtable(files) \
+	(rcu_dereference_check((files)->fdt, \
+			       rcu_read_lock_held() || \
+			       lockdep_is_held(&(files)->file_lock) || \
+			       atomic_read(&files->count) == 1))

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 153 exceeds 100 columns
#111: FILE: include/linux/fdtable.h:85:
+		file = rcu_dereference_check(fdt->fd[fd], rcu_read_lock_held() || lockdep_is_held(&files->file_lock) || atomic_read(&files->count) == 1);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
