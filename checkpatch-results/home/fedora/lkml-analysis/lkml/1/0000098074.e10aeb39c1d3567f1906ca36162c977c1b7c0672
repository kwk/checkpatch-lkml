Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#370: FILE: block/elevator-fq.h:390:
+extern unsigned short get_group_requests(struct request_queue *q,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
