WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#168: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init_32.c:184:
+		BUG_ON(bootmem_state != BEFORE_BOOTMEM);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#279: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init_64.c:513:
+		if (bootmem_state != AFTER_BOOTMEM &&
 				!e820_any_mapped(addr, addr+PUD_SIZE, 0)) {

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#316: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1076:
+};
+extern enum bootmem_state_t bootmem_state;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
