WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#29: 
the kernel command line.  The serial console specification is enhanced to be:

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#83: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:2635:
+		uart_parse_options(options, &baud, &parity, &bits, &flow, &port->iobase, &port->uartclk);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns

+uart_parse_options(char *options, int *baud, int *parity, int *bits, int *flow, int *ioport, int *clk)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#125: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_core.c:1893:
+		if (*s == '0' && (*(s + 1) == 'x' || *(s + 1) == 'X')) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#130: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_core.c:1898:
+		*ioport = simple_strtoul(s, NULL, b);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
