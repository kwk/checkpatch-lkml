#122: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/messaging.c:494:
 		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: User [%d] does not have a daemon "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#197: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/miscdev.c:297:
+	BUG_ON(euid != daemon->euid);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
