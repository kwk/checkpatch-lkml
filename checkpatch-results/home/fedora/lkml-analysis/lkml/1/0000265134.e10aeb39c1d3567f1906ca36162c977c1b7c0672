Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#127: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:947:
+void ide_read_bcount_and_ireason(ide_drive_t *, u16 *, u8 *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'u16 *' should also have an identifier name
#127: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:947:
+void ide_read_bcount_and_ireason(ide_drive_t *, u16 *, u8 *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'u8 *' should also have an identifier name
