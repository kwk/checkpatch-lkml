WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#292: FILE: arch/i386/xen/enlighten.c:667:
+	/* Update while interrupts are disabled, so its atomic with
+	   respect to ipis */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#389: FILE: arch/i386/xen/multicalls.c:36:
+		void (*fn)(void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
