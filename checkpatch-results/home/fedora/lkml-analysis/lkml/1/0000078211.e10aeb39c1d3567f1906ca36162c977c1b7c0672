+	---help---
+	  Moorestown is Intel's Low Power Intel Architecture (LPIA) based Moblin
+	  Internet Device(MID) platform. Moorestown consists of two chips:
+	  Lincroft (CPU core, graphics, and memory controller) and Langwell IOH.
+	  Unlike standard x86 PCs, Moorestown does not have many legacy devices
+	  nor standard legacy replacement devices/features. e.g. Moorestown does
+	  not contain i8259, i8254, HPET, legacy BIOS, most of the io ports.
+
 config X86_RDC321X
 	bool "RDC R-321x SoC"
 	depends on X86_32

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/setup.h:53:
+extern void x86_mrst_early_setup(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
