CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1833:
+extern void do_notify_parent_adopted(struct task_struct *, struct task_struct *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct task_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#95: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1833:
+extern void do_notify_parent_adopted(struct task_struct *, struct task_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

+extern void do_notify_parent_adopted(struct task_struct *, struct task_struct *);

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#132: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1488:
+	memset (&info, 0, sizeof info);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SIZEOF_PARENTHESIS: sizeof info should be sizeof(info)
#132: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1488:

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#204: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:2284:
+	 * on SID transitions. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
