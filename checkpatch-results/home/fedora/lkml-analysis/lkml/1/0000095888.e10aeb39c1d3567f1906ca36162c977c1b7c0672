WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#43: 
That's because enough swap space check is done in case of only lumpy reclaim.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#76: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:939:
+									!PageSwapCache(cursor_page)))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
