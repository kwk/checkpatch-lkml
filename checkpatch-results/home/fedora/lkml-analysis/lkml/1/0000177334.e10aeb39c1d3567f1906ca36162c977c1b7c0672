The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#130: FILE: drivers/misc/lowmemorykiller.c:74:
+       rem = global_page_state(NR_ACTIVE_ANON) +

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'NR_ACTIVE_FILE' should also have an identifier name
#130: FILE: drivers/misc/lowmemorykiller.c:74:
+       rem = global_page_state(NR_ACTIVE_ANON) +

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
