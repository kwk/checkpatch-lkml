CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#88: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/frontends/si21xx.c:756:
+		inband_interferer_div2[i] = inband_interferer_div4[i] = false;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
