WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#53: FILE: include/linux/pm.h:188:
+struct dev_pm_ops name = { \

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
