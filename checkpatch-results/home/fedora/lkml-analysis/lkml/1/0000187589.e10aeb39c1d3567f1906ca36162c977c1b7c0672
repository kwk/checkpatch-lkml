The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#107: FILE: Documentation/lguest/lguest.c:702:
 		iov[*out_num + *in_num].iov_base
+			= check_pointer(desc[i].addr, desc[i].len);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
