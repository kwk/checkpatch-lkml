ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#60: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_main.c:65:
+int ehca_scaling_code  = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#69: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_main.c:802:
 	printk(KERN_INFO "eHCA Infiniband Device Driver "
+	       "(Rel.: SVNEHCA_0023)\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
