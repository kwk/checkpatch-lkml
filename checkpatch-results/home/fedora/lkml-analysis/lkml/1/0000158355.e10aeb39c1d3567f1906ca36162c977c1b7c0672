WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'doens't' may be misspelled - perhaps 'doesn't'?
#36: 
only failure mode is when the chunk doens't have enough room, so
                                    ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'accomodate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'accommodate'?
#56: FILE: mm/percpu.c:313:
+ * Extend area map of @chunk so that it can accomodate an allocation.
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'accomodate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'accommodate'?
#106: FILE: mm/percpu.c:368:

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#143: FILE: mm/percpu.c:375:
+	BUG_ON(chunk->map_alloc < chunk->map_used + nr_extra);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
