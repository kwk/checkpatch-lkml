Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#92: FILE: fs/nfsd/vfs.c:756:
+	int (*fsync) (struct file *, struct dentry *, int);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#92: FILE: fs/nfsd/vfs.c:756:
+	int (*fsync) (struct file *, struct dentry *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dentry *' should also have an identifier name
#92: FILE: fs/nfsd/vfs.c:756:
+	int (*fsync) (struct file *, struct dentry *, int);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#96: FILE: fs/nfsd/vfs.c:760:
+	if (err == 0 && fop && (fsync = fop->fsync))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#108: FILE: fs/nfsd/vfs.c:771:
+        int err;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#108: FILE: fs/nfsd/vfs.c:771:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#110: FILE: fs/nfsd/vfs.c:773:
+	struct inode *inode = filp->f_path.dentry->d_inode;
+	dprintk("nfsd: sync file %s\n", filp->f_path.dentry->d_name.name);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
