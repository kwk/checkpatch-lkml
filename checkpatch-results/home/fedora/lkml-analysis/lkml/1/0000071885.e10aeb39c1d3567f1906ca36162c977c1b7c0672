WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#329: 
# dmidecode 2.10

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#1038: FILE: var/log/Xorg.0.log:22:
+(==) Log file: "/var/log/Xorg.0.log", Time: Wed Sep 16 07:05:48 2009

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
