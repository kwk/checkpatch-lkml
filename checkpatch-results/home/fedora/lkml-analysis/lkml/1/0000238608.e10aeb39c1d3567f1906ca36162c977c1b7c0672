CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#234: FILE: arch/um/include/um_malloc.h:11:
+extern void *uml_kmalloc(int size, int flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#242: FILE: arch/um/include/um_malloc.h:19:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
