+	  This is a very simple bitbanging i2c driver utilizing the
+	  arch-neutral GPIO API to control the SCL and SDA lines.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#103: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/gpio.h> instead of <asm/gpio.h>

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*adap)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_adapter)...)
#172: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-gpio.c:65:
+	adap = kzalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_adapter), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory
