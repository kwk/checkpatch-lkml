CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#41: FILE: include/linux/sm501.h:160:
+#define SM501_FLAG_SUSPEND_OFF		(1<<4)
                               		  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#41: FILE: include/linux/sm501.h:160:
+#define SM501_FLAG_SUSPEND_OFF		(1<<4)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pd"
#73: FILE: drivers/mfd/sm501.c:1148:
+	if (pd == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
