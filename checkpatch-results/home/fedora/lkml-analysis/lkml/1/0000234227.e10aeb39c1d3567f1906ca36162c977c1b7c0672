Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#163: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:1804:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "FUSE %u:%u duplicate fh detected, "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#164: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:1805:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "FUSE %u:%u duplicate fh detected, "
+			       "poll will malfunction, please fix client\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#173: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:1814:
+static unsigned fuse_file_poll(struct file *file, poll_table *wait)

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#215: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:1856:
+	if (err == -ENOSYS) {

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#354: FILE: include/linux/fuse.h:173:
+#define FUSE_POLL_SCHEDULE_NOTIFY (1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
