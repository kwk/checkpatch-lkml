Extends the original CFQ data sructures and adds the major cfqio_subsys

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/linux/cfqio-cgroup.h:38:
+extern void cfqio_ss_exit_queue(struct cfq_data *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct cfq_data *' should also have an identifier name
#66: FILE: include/linux/cfqio-cgroup.h:38:
+extern void cfqio_ss_exit_queue(struct cfq_data *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#142: FILE: include/linux/cfq-iosched.h:69:
+	/* use this cgroup if CGROUP_CFQIO is off:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#226: FILE: block/cfqio-cgroup.c:63:
+	if (cfqio_cgrp)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
