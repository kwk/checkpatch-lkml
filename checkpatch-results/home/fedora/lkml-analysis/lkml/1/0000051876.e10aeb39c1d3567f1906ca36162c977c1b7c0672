WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#61: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#66: FILE: tools/perf/bench/sched-pipe.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#97: FILE: tools/perf/bench/sched-pipe.c:32:
+static int simple = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#104: FILE: tools/perf/bench/sched-pipe.c:39:
+		    "Do simple output (this maybe useful for"
+		    "processing by scripts or graph tools like gnuplot)"),

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:MISSING_SPACE: break quoted strings at a space character
#104: FILE: tools/perf/bench/sched-pipe.c:39:
+		    "Do simple output (this maybe useful for"
+		    "processing by scripts or graph tools like gnuplot)"),

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#161: FILE: tools/perf/bench/sched-pipe.c:96:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#163: FILE: tools/perf/bench/sched-pipe.c:98:
+		printf("(executing %d pipe operations between two tasks)\n\n",
+			loops);
