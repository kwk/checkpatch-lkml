# cat /proc/cmdline

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

#72: FILE: arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c:32:
+/* The array maps a real numa node to the first fake node that gets
+created on it */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
