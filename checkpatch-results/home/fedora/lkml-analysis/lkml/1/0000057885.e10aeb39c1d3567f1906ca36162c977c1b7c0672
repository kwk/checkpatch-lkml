WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#100: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:698:
+	BUG_ON(sizeof(char[1 - 2 * !!(cond)]) != 1)

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
