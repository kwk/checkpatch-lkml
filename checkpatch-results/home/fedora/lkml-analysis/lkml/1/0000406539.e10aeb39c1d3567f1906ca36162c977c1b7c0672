Signed-Off-By: Bodo Eggert <7eggert@gmx.de>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#59: FILE: fs/Kconfig:1000:
+^I  $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after saved_root_name[64]
#138: FILE: init/do_mounts.c:28:
+static char __initdata saved_root_name[64] = "rootfs";

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#166: FILE: mm/shmem.c:2592:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

+/*static struct super_block *rootfs_get_sb(struct file_system_type *fs_type,

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
