WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#81: FILE: drivers/scsi/gdth.c:3789:
+    BUG_ON(list_empty(&gdth_instances));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'gdth_halt', this function's name, in a string
#155: FILE: drivers/scsi/gdth.c:5135:
+	TRACE2(("gdth_halt() event %d\n", (int)event));

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - void gdth_shutdown() should probably be void gdth_shutdown(void)

should be::
