#34: 
kernel_thread() is being depracated.  This patch moves the jffs2 garbage
                         ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#70: FILE: fs/jffs2/background.c:45:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "fork failed for JFFS2 garbage collect thread: %ld\n", -PTR_ERR(tsk));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'jffs2_garbage_collect_thread', this function's name, in a string

+			D1(printk(KERN_DEBUG "jffs2_garbage_collect_thread():  kthread_stop() called.\n"));

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
