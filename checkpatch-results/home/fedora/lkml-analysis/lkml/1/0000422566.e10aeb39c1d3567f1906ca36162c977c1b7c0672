> WARNING: arch/alpha/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x7d2c): Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:init_rtc_irq (between 'common_init_rtc' and 'timer_interrupt')

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#106: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:2520:
+ * function marked __init (serial8250_console_Setup() */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
