CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#351: FILE: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.c:1229:
+	init_net.ct.htable_size = nf_conntrack_htable_size = hashsize;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
