CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#121: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/i387.h:176:
+extern void finit_task(struct task_struct *tsk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#169: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/efi.c:484:
+		if (end_pfn <= max_low_pfn_mapped
+		    || (end_pfn > (1UL << (32 - PAGE_SHIFT))

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#170: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/efi.c:485:
+		    || (end_pfn > (1UL << (32 - PAGE_SHIFT))
+			&& end_pfn <= max_pfn_mapped))

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#279: FILE: arch/x86/math-emu/fpu_aux.c:37:
+	struct address *oaddr, *iaddr;
+	soft->cwd = 0x037f;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
