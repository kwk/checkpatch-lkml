#53: 
Subject: [PATCH v2] i7300_idle: allow testing on i5000-series hardware w/o re-compile

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#93: FILE: drivers/dma/ioat_dma.c:176:
+	if (i7300_idle_platform_probe(NULL, NULL, 1) == 0) {
 		device->common.chancnt--;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
