So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro

  if (some_condition)

  else

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
