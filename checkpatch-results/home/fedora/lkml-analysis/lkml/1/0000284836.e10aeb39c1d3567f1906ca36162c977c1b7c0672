Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'free_memtype', this function's name, in a string
#142: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pat.c:475:
+	PAT_PRINTK("free_memtype request 0x%Lx-0x%Lx\n", start, end);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
