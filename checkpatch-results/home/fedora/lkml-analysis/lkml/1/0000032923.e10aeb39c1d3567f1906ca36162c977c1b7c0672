WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct stacktrace_ops should normally be const
#71: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/stacktrace.h:9:
+struct stacktrace_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
