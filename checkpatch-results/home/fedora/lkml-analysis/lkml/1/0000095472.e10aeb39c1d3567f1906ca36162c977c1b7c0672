Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#158: FILE: drivers/base/platform.c:559:
+	retval = code = __platform_driver_register(drv);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#170: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:206:
+extern int core_kernel_init_text(unsigned long addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#173: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:209:
+extern int kernel_init_text_address(unsigned long addr);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "__module_init_text_address"
#264: FILE: kernel/module.c:2902:
+	ret = __module_init_text_address(addr) != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#289: FILE: kernel/module.c:2939:
+	struct module *mod = __module_address(addr);
+	if (mod) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
