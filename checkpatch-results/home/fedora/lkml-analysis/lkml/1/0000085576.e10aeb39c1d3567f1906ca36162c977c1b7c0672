ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#66: FILE: Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt:1118:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#82: FILE: drivers/ata/ahci.c:223:
+	AHCI_HFLAG_SRST_TOUT_IS_OFFLINE	= (1 << 11), /* treat SRST timeout as
+							link offline */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#100: FILE: drivers/ata/ahci.c:1707:
+	if (rc == -EBUSY && hpriv->flags & AHCI_HFLAG_SRST_TOUT_IS_OFFLINE) {
[...]
+	} else if (rc) {
[...]
-	}
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
