#27: 
add throttle to shrink_zone() for performance improvement and prevent incorrect oom.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'cutted' may be misspelled - perhaps 'cut'?
#75: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:77:
+	/* Can shrink be cutted off if other task freeded enough page. */
 	                 ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

+	/* !__GFP_IO and/or !__GFP_FS task may grab some locks.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
