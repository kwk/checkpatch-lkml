WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#58: FILE: fs/splice.c:914:
+pipe_buffer_at(struct pipe_inode_info *pipe, unsigned i)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#60: FILE: fs/splice.c:916:
+	BUG_ON(i >= PIPE_BUFFERS);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#103: FILE: fs/splice.c:959:
+			/* yes, it is - keep the locks and end this
+			   loop */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
