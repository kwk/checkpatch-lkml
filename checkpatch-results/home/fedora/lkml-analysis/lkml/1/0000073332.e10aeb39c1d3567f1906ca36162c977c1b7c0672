ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#54: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:50:
+static int			timechart			= 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
