CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1667:
+extern void futex_adjust_waiters(struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#98: FILE: kernel/futex.c:364:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#107: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1195:
+	struct lock_waiter_state blocked_on =
+		{ .lock_type = FUTEX_WAITER, { .futex_blocked_on = &q} };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
