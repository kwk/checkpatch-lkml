WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#364: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:82:
+extern int rr_interval;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#373: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:172:
+/* Constants for minimum and maximum testing in vm_table.
+   We use these as one-element integer vectors. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:DUPLICATED_SYSCTL_CONST: duplicated sysctl range checking value 'one', consider using the shared one in include/linux/sysctl.h
#394: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:534:
+		.extra1		= &one,

Commit d91bff3011cf ("proc/sysctl: add shared variables for range
check") added some shared const variables to be used instead of a local
copy in each source file.

Consider replacing the sysctl range checking value with the shared
one in include/linux/sysctl.h.  The following conversion scheme may
be used::

  &zero     ->  SYSCTL_ZERO
  &one      ->  SYSCTL_ONE
  &int_max  ->  SYSCTL_INT_MAX
