WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#30: 
 .../m68k/include/asm/{checksum_mm.h => checksum.h} |   11 ++

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#48: FILE: arch/m68k/include/asm/checksum.h:37:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
