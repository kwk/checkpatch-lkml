#50: 
Agree. I've got rig from timekeeping. Now I'm using system device tree shutdown interface, as you suggested. I've added HPET system device class with shutdown method and HPET device to sysdev.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#107: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/hpet.c:170:

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#138: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/hpet.c:596:
+	int error = sysdev_class_register(&hpet_sysdev_class);
+	if (!error)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
