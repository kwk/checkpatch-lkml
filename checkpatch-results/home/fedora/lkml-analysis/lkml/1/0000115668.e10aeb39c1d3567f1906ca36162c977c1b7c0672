WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#122: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/ccwgroup.c:563:
+static struct dev_pm_ops ccwgroup_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ccwgroup_device *' should also have an identifier name
#161: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/ccwgroup.h:59:
+	int (*prepare) (struct ccwgroup_device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
