CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*p)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct proc_mounts)...)
#166: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:542:
+	p = kmalloc(sizeof(struct proc_mounts), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#198: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:571:
+	struct proc_mounts *p = file->private_data;
+	path_put(&p->root);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
