CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "drive->queue"
#59: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-iops.c:760:
+	if (drive->queue != NULL && !in_interrupt()) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#61: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-iops.c:762:
+		error = ide_wait_cmd(drive, WIN_SETFEATURES, speed,
+		    SETFEATURES_XFER, 0, NULL);

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#65: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-iops.c:766:
+			return (error);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
