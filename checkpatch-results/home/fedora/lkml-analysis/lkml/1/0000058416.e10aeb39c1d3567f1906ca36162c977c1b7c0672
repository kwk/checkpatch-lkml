CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#108: FILE: include/linux/kmemleak.h:35:
+extern void kmemleak_scan_area(const void *ptr, size_t length,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+static inline void kmemleak_scan_area(const void *ptr, size_t length,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
