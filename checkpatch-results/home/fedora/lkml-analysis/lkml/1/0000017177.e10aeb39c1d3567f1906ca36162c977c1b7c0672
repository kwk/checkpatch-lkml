Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#92: FILE: arch/arm/plat-mxc/include/mach/mxc_keypad.h:1:
+#ifndef __MACH_MXC_KEYPAD_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#102: FILE: arch/arm/plat-mxc/include/mach/mxc_keypad.h:11:
+struct mxc_keypad_platform_data {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+	  Enable support for MXC keypad port.

+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
