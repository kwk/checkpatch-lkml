WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#181: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#186: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/debug-devices.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#187: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/debug-devices.c:2:
+ * linux/arch/arm/plat-omap/debug-devices.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#202: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/debug-devices.c:17:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#207: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/debug-devices.c:22:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#262: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/debug-devices.c:77:

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#282: FILE: include/asm-arm/arch-omap/board.h:177:
+extern int debug_card_init(u32 addr, unsigned gpio);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#282: FILE: include/asm-arm/arch-omap/board.h:177:
+extern int debug_card_init(u32 addr, unsigned gpio);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
