WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#106: FILE: drivers/power/pda_power.c:429:
+static struct dev_pm_ops pda_power_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
