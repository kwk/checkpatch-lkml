WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#56: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1007:
+		BUG_ON(hwgroup->hwif != hwif);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#73: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1024:
+			BUG_ON(hwgroup->drive != NULL);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "hwgroup->drive"
#73: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1024:
+			BUG_ON(hwgroup->drive != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
