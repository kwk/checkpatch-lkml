Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#101: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/sfi.c:39:

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
