Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#88: FILE: drivers/base/power/suspend.c:81:
+	if (!error && !dev->no_suspend && dev->bus && dev->bus->suspend && !dev->power.power_state.event) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_RW: Use DEVICE_ATTR_RW
#125: FILE: drivers/base/power/sysfs.c:171:
+}

The DEVICE_ATTR_RW(name) helper macro can be used instead of
DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0644, name_show, name_store);

Note that the macro automatically appends _show and _store to the
named attribute variable of the device for the show and store methods.
