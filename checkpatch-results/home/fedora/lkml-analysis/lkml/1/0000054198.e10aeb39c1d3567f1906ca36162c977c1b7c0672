WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'unmodfied' may be misspelled - perhaps 'unmodified'?
#49: 
This works on an unmodfied kernel... although I certainly don't feel
                 ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'mutexint_lock', this function's name, in a string
#131: FILE: mutexint.c:112:
+					printf("mutexint_lock canceled, aborting\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#135: FILE: mutexint.c:116:
+					printf("\top: 0x%x\n", FUTEX_LOCK_PI | FUTEX_PRIVATE | FUTEX_INTERRUPTIBLE);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
