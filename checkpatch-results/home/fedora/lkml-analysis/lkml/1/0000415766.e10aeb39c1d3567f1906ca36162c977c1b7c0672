WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#53: FILE: fs/hfsplus/hfsplus_fs.h:324:
+extern struct dentry_operations hfsplus_dentry_operations;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#173: FILE: fs/hfsplus/unicode.c:405:
+	       (off2 < duc2.size || len2 > 0)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
