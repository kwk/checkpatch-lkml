> If I try on my Vaio VGN-FZ240E, using the latest kernel 2.6.30-rc1-00191-gd848223

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct snd_jack *' should also have an identifier name
#118: FILE: include/sound/jack.h:54:
+	void (*private_free)(struct snd_jack *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#147: FILE: sound/pci/hda/patch_conexant.c:356:
+	struct conexant_jack *jacks = jack->private_data;
+	jacks->nid = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
