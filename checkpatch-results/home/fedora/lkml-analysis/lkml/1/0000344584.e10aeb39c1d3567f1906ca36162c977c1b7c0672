CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#64: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:724:
+	ret = mem_cgroup_charge_common(page, mm, gfp_mask,
 				MEM_CGROUP_CHARGE_TYPE_CACHE);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#215: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:38:
+extern void mem_cgroup_uncharge_page(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
