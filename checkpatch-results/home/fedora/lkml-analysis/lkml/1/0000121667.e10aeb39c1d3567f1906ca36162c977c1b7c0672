Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#337: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:82:
+^I^I^I^I ^I  enum writeback_sync_modes sync_mode)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#337: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:82:
+^I^I^I^I ^I  enum writeback_sync_modes sync_mode)$

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#426: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:443:
+		if (!bdi_wblist_needs_lock(bdi))
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
