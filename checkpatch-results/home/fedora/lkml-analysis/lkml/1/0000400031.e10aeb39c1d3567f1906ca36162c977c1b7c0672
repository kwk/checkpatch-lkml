ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#50: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:316:
+		if ((new->flags & IRQF_DISABLED) &&

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#50: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:316:
+		if ((new->flags & IRQF_DISABLED) &&
[...]
+			old->flags |= IRQF_DISABLED);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
