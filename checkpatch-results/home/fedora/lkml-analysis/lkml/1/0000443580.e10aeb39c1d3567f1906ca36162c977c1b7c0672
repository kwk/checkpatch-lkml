#38: 
This patch attempts to address such a situation with a fix for kthread_stop.

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#124: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:145:
+	int ret = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#125: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:146:
+	if (freezer_status.count >= 0)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#145: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:166:
+		BUG_ON(freezer_status.count <= 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#151: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:172:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#200: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:68:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
