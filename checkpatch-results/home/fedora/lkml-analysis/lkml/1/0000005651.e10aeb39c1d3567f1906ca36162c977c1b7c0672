WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#125: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:460:
+		if (env) {
+			sprintf(cmdline, "%s/scripts/setlocalversion %s 2> /dev/null", env, env);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "slv"
#130: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:465:
+	if (slv != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
