CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#64: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:961:
+		current->mm->brk = current->mm->start_brk = new_brk;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_RANDOMIZE_BRK' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#111: FILE: include/asm-i386/elf.h:163:
+#define ARCH_HAS_RANDOMIZE_BRK

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#112: FILE: include/asm-i386/elf.h:164:
+extern void arch_randomize_brk(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
