ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#100: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:1107:
+	const char *namelist3 [] = {

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "strstr"
#112: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:1119:
+		if (strstr(name, *s) != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
