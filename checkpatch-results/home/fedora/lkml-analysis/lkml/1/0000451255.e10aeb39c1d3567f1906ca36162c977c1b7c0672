The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/asm-i386/reboot_fixups.h:4:
+extern void mach_reboot_fixups(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
