#50: 
The AMD Geode LX has an x86 id of 5 (i586) tought it's technically an i686:
                                           ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#58: 
indeed it has MMX, MMXEXT and CMOV, just lacks the long NOP instruction (NOPL).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#87: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/amd.c:142:
+		/* Geode only lacks the NOPL instruction to be i686,

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#110: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#111: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c:2:
+ *  linux/arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#122: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c:13:
+void do_invalid_op(struct pt_regs *regs, long error_code);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#135: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c:26:
+	int length = 3;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
