CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#215: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:731:
+extern int blk_end_request(struct request *rq, int error, int nr_bytes);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
