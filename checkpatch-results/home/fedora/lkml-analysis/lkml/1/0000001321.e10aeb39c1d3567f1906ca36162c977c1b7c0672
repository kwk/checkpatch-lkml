#27: 
The commit 38b7827fc removed cpu_local_xx macros that lead to

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#49: FILE: arch/mips/include/asm/local.h:197:
+/* Need to disable preemption for the cpu local counters otherwise we could
+   still access a variable of a previous CPU in a non atomic way. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
