WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#60: FILE: drivers/net//phy/phy.c:874:

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#88: FILE: drivers/net//phy/phy_device.c:702:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
