WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#39: 
Signed-Off-By: Miloslav Trmac <mitr@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

+			  uid_t loginuid, unsigned sessionid, int major,

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

+		audit_log_format(ab, "%s pid=%u uid=%u auid=%u ses=%u "
+				 "major=%d minor=%d comm=", description,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#169: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:406:
+extern void tty_audit_tiocsti(struct tty_struct *tty, char ch);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#177: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:415:
 }
+static inline void tty_audit_tiocsti(struct tty_struct *tty, char ch)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
