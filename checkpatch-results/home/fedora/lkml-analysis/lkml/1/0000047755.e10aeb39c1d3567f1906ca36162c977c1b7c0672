CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'i' - possible side-effects?
#73: FILE: fs/compat_ioctl.c:1057:
+#define XFORM(i) (((i) ^ ((i) << 27) ^ ((i) << 17)) & 0xffffffff)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#123: FILE: fs/compat_ioctl.c:1864:
+	/* guess initial offset into table, assuming a
+	   normalized distribution */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#180: FILE: fs/compat_ioctl.c:1966:
+	unsigned int a, b;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
