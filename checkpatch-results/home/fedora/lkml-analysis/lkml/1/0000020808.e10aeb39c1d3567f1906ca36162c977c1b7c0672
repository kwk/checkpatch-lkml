CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:945:
+extern int bdev_stack_limits(struct queue_limits *t, struct block_device *bdev,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#88: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:946:
+extern int bdev_stack_limits(struct queue_limits *t, struct block_device *bdev,
