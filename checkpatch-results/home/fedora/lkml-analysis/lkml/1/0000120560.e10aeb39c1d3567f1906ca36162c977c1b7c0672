WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#69: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/mmc_spi.c:342:
+			value = -ENOSYS; /* Function not implemented */

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
