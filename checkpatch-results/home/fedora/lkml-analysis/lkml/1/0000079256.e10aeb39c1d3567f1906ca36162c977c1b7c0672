#108: FILE: include/linux/ftrace_event.h:115:
+	int			(*regfunc)(struct ftrace_event_call *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#336: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_events.c:1001:
+			if (ret != -ENOSYS)

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
