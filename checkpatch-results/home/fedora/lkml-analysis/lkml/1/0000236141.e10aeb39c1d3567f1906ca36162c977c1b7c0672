WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 189 exceeds 100 columns
#86: FILE: kernel/resource.c:169:
+		printk("ignoring resource conflict between %s/{%p..%p} and %s/{%p..%p}\n", new->name, (void *)new->start, (void *)new->end, tmp->name, (void *)tmp->start, (void *)tmp->end);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
