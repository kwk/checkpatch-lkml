WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#48: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#53: FILE: arch/arm/mach-at91/include/mach/atmel-mci.h:1:
+#ifndef __MACH_ATMEL_MCI_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 's' - possible side-effects?

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*slave)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct mci_dma_slave)...)
#106: FILE: arch/avr32/mach-at32ap/at32ap700x.c:1344:
+	slave = kzalloc(sizeof(struct mci_dma_slave), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!host"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
