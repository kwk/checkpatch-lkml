CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!task->mm"
#136: FILE: arch/um/kernel/skas/uaccess.c:24:
+	if (task->mm == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pte_out"
#155: FILE: arch/um/kernel/skas/uaccess.c:43:
+	if (pte_out != NULL)

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#157: FILE: arch/um/kernel/skas/uaccess.c:45:
+	return (void *) (pte_val(ptent) & PAGE_MASK) + (addr & ~PAGE_MASK);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
