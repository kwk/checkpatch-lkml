CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#103: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:228:
+extern void touch_cpu_softlockup_watchdog(void);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

 }
+static inline void touch_cpu_softlockup_watchdog(void)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
