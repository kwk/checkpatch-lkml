WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#57: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xp_uv.c:51:
+	BUG_ON(!uv_gpa_in_mmr_space(src_gpa));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <xpSuccess>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#69: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xp_uv.c:63:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "buf_base"
#104: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc_partition.c:100:
+			if (buf_base != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
