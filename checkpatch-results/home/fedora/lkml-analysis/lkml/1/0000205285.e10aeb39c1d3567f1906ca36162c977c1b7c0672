CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/include/mach/reset.h:19:
+extern int init_gpio_reset(int gpio, int output);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
