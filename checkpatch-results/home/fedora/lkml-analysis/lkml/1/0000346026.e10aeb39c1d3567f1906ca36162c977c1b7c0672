#31: 
This patch makes hrtimer_forward() to return a u64 instead of unsigned long.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:325:
+extern u64 ktime_divns(const ktime_t kt, s64 div);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
#82: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:327:
+# define ktime_divns(kt, div)		(u64)((kt).tv64 / (div))

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
