CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#154: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:904:
+extern int blk_init_allocated_queue(struct request_queue *q,

files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#155: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:905:
+extern int blk_init_allocated_queue(struct request_queue *q,
+				request_fn_proc *rfn, spinlock_t *lock);
