CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:171:
+extern unsigned int nr_unallocated_buffer_pages(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#73: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1826:
+		unsigned long left = zone_page_state(zone, NR_FREE_PAGES);
+		if (left > high)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
