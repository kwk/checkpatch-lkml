CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#346: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:763:
+static void idefloppy_create_mode_sense_cmd(struct ide_atapi_pc *pc,
+		u8 page_code, u8 type)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#392: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:822:
+	pc->req_xfer = pc->buf_size = blocks * floppy->block_size;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#417: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:843:
+	pc->req_xfer = pc->buf_size = rq->data_len;

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#434: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:880:
+		pc = (struct ide_atapi_pc *) rq->buffer;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
