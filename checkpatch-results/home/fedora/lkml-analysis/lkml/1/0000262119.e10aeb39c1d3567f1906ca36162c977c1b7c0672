CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#63: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:44:
+#define MEM_CGROUP_HEAP_SIZE		(1 << MEM_CGROUP_HEAP_SHIFT)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#147: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:783:
+			BUG_ON(!mem->on_heap);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

#207: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:41:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
