WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#38: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .15
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/ppc32.h:138:
+extern int copy_siginfo_to_user32(struct compat_siginfo __user *d, siginfo_t *s);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "child->sighand"
#83: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace32.c:76:
+	if (likely(child->sighand != NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "child->last_siginfo"
#86: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace32.c:79:
+		if (likely(child->last_siginfo != NULL)) {

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#152: FILE: drivers/acpi/bay.c:306:
+		printk(KERN_INFO PREFIX "Error installing bay notify handler\n");

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Celcius' may be misspelled - perhaps ''?
#177: FILE: drivers/acpi/thermal.c:365:
+		 * Below zero (Celcius) values clearly aren't right for sure..
 		               ^^^^^^^

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#181: FILE: drivers/acpi/thermal.c:369:
+		if (ACPI_FAILURE(status) ||
+				tz->trips.critical.temperature <= 2732) {

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#222: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/appletouch.c:601:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "appletouch: Geyser mode initialized.\n");

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after i8042_dmi_nopnp_table[]
#350: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042-x86ia64io.h:312:
+static struct dmi_system_id __initdata i8042_dmi_nopnp_table[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#423: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:941:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "i8042: Can't write CTR to resume, retrying...\n");

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#426: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:944:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "i8042: CTR write retry failed\n");

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#442: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ath5k/base.c:2868:
+	 * allow software encryption */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#491: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_mbox.c:3183:
+	     (adapter->fw_version[0] == '6'
+	      && adapter->fw_version[2] == '6'

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#492: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_mbox.c:3184:
+	      && adapter->fw_version[2] == '6'
+	      && adapter->fw_version[3] > '1'))) {

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <wIndex>
#534: FILE: drivers/usb/host/ehci-hub.c:624:
+			clear_bit(wIndex, &ehci->port_c_suspend);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#565: FILE: drivers/usb/host/ehci.h:101:

+			the change-suspend feature turned on */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#565: FILE: drivers/usb/host/ehci.h:101:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'wether' may be misspelled - perhaps 'weather'?
#665: FILE: fs/jbd/transaction.c:1257:
+	/* keep track of wether or not this transaction modified us */
 	                 ^^^^^^

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#997: FILE: fs/partitions/msdos.c:453:
+			fb = (struct fat_boot_sector *) data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#999: FILE: fs/partitions/msdos.c:455:
+			if (slot == 1 && fb->reserved && fb->fats
+				&& fat_valid_media(fb->media)) {

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#1000: FILE: fs/partitions/msdos.c:456:
+				printk("\n");

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#1003: FILE: fs/partitions/msdos.c:459:
+				return 1;
+			} else {

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#1046: FILE: fs/romfs/inode.c:443:
+		filled = romfs_copyfrom(inode, buf, ROMFS_I(inode)->i_dataoffset+offset, readlen);
 		                                                                ^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#1060: FILE: fs/romfs/inode.c:453:
+		memset(buf + filled, 0, PAGE_SIZE-filled);
 		                                 ^

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#1078: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs.h:63:
+	return 0xf8 <= media || media == 0xf0;

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#1461: FILE: sound/pci/hda/patch_analog.c:2573:
+		hda_nid_t dac = ad1988_idx_to_dac(codec, ad1988_pin_idx(pin));
+		if (dac == nid)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
