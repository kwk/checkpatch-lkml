Subject: [PATCH 14/33] score: create head files syscalls.h uaccess.h ucontext.h unistd.h user.h

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#49: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#54: FILE: arch/score/include/asm/syscalls.h:1:
+#ifndef _ASM_SCORE_SYSCALLS_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: arch/score/include/asm/uaccess.h:11:
+extern int fixup_exception(struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of '__ARCH_HAVE_MMU' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#114: FILE: arch/score/include/asm/unistd.h:4:
+#define __ARCH_HAVE_MMU

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.
