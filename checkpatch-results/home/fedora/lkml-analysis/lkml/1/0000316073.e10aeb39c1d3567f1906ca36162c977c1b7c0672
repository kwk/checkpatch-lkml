#34: 
The maple bus driver that went into the kernel mainline in September 2007 contained some bugs which were revealed by the update of the kobj code for the current release series. Unfortunately those bugs also helped ensure maple devices were properly detected. This patch (against the current git) now ensures that devices are properly detected again.

Comparisons of A to true and false are better written
as A and !A.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'scanning == 2'
#145: FILE: b/drivers/sh/maple/maple.c:489:
+	if (!started || (scanning == 2) || !fullscan) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
