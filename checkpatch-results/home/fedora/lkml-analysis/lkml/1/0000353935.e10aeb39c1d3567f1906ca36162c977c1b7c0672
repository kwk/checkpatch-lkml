Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'x' - possible side-effects?

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#242: FILE: include/linux/capability.h:473:
+extern long cap_prctl_drop(unsigned long cap);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
