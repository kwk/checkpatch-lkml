#27: 
No need to export any TCP internals to anybody else. So express this in a namespace.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'implicitely' may be misspelled - perhaps 'implicitly'?
#34: 
This implicitely turns all exports into GPL only, but that won't matter
     ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
