WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#34: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#39: FILE: drivers/pwm/gpio.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#40: FILE: drivers/pwm/gpio.c:2:
+ * drivers/pwm/gpio.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#57: FILE: drivers/pwm/gpio.c:19:
+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#87: FILE: drivers/pwm/gpio.c:49:
+gpio_pwm_work (struct work_struct *work)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
#131: FILE: drivers/pwm/gpio.c:93:
+			      ktime_set(0,gp->pwm.channels[0].period_ticks
 			                 ^

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#158: FILE: drivers/pwm/gpio.c:120:
+	switch (c->config_mask) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#166: FILE: drivers/pwm/gpio.c:128:
+		if (!hrtimer_active(&gp->t)) {
+			gpio_pwm_start(p);
+		}

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#240: FILE: drivers/pwm/gpio.c:202:
+	if ((c->config_mask & PWM_CONFIG_START)
+	    || (was_on && !(c->config_mask & PWM_CONFIG_STOP)))

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#251: FILE: drivers/pwm/gpio.c:213:
+	struct gpio_pwm *gp = to_gpio_pwm(p);
+	gp->callback = callback;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#262: FILE: drivers/pwm/gpio.c:224:
+static int __devinit

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#271: FILE: drivers/pwm/gpio.c:233:
+	 * specification and rebuilding their kernel */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
