Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#107: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-probe.c:312:
+	pp->probes[0] = buf = zalloc(MAX_CMDLEN);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!self"
#219: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:99:
+	if (self == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
