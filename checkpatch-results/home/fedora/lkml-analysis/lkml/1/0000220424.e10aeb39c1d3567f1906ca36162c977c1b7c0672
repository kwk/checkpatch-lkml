CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#377: FILE: block/blktrace.c:702:
+	if (bio)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead
#793: FILE: include/linux/tracepoint.h:132:
+#define tracepoint_synchronize_unregister() synchronize_sched()

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis
