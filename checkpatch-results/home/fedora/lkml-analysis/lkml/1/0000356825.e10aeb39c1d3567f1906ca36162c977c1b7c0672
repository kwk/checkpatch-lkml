WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .4
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#85: FILE: include/net/9p/9p.h:424:
+}
+static inline void p9_sysctl_unregister(void)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#508: FILE: net/mac80211/ieee80211_sta.c:886:
+	ieee802_11_parse_elems(pos, len - (pos - (u8 *) mgmt), &elems);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#534: FILE: net/mac80211/ieee80211_sta.c:1169:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: invalid aid value %d; bits 15:14 not "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#535: FILE: net/mac80211/ieee80211_sta.c:1170:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: invalid aid value %d; bits 15:14 not "
+		       "set\n", dev->name, aid);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#545: FILE: net/mac80211/ieee80211_sta.c:1174:
+	ieee802_11_parse_elems(pos, len - (pos - (u8 *) mgmt), &elems);

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#554: FILE: net/mac80211/ieee80211_sta.c:1186:
 		struct ieee80211_sta_bss *bss
+			= ieee80211_rx_bss_get(dev, ifsta->bssid,

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#732: FILE: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c:839:
+			IP_CT_TCP_FLAG_CLOSE_INIT)
+		    || (conntrack->proto.tcp.last_dir == dir

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#733: FILE: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c:840:
+^I^I        && conntrack->proto.tcp.last_index == TCP_RST_SET)) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#733: FILE: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c:840:
+		    || (conntrack->proto.tcp.last_dir == dir
+		        && conntrack->proto.tcp.last_index == TCP_RST_SET)) {

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#735: FILE: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c:842:
+			 * Delete this connection and look up again. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#742: FILE: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c:849:
+		/* Fall through */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#840: FILE: net/sched/cls_u32.c:94:
+	unsigned h = ntohl(key & sel->hmask)>>fshift;

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '>>' (ctx:VxV)
#840: FILE: net/sched/cls_u32.c:94:
+	unsigned h = ntohl(key & sel->hmask)>>fshift;
 	                                    ^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#868: FILE: net/sched/sch_api.c:1234:
+		   (u32)NSEC_PER_SEC/(u32)ktime_to_ns(timespec_to_ktime(ts)));
 		                    ^
