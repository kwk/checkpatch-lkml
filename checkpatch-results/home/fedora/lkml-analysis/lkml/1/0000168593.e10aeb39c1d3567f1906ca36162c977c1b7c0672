CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:182:
+extern void update_page_reclaim_stat(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#122: FILE: mm/swap.c:183:
+		update_page_reclaim_stat_locked(zone, page,
+					 !!page_is_file_cache(page), 1);
