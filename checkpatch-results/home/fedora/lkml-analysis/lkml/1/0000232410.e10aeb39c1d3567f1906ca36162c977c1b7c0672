CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#175: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tsc.c:187:
+		tsc = tr1 = tr2 = get_cycles();

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#181: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tsc.c:193:
+			if ((unsigned int) delta < tscmin)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#206: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tsc.c:218:
+		if (pitcnt > 5000 && tscmax < 10 * tscmin) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
