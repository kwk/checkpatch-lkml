CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#126: FILE: arch/x86/mm/discontig_32.c:319:
+	system_max_low_pfn = max_low_pfn = find_max_low_pfn();

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#181: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/numaq_32.c:66:
+			e820_register_active_regions(node, node_start_pfn[node],
+							node_end_pfn[node]);
