WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'markes' may be misspelled - perhaps 'marks'?
#76: 
not configured. Since DEBUG_RODATA markes the kernel text pages as read-only.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#91: FILE: arch/i386/Kconfig:1215:
+source "arch/i386/Kconfig.debug"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
