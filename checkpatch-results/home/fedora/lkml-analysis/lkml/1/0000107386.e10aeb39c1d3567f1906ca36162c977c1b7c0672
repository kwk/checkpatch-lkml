WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#76: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#81: FILE: fs/staging/Kconfig:1:
+menuconfig FSSTAGING
+	bool "Staging file systems"
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  This option allows you to select a number of file systems
+	  that are not of the "normal" Linux kernel quality level.
+	  These are placed here in order to get a wider audience to
+	  make use of them.  Please note that these are under heavy
+	  development, may or may not work, and may contain userspace
+	  interfaces that most likely will be changed in the near
+	  future.
+
+	  Using any of these file systems will taint your kernel which
+	  might affect support options from both the community, and
+	  various commercial support organizations.
+
+	  If you wish to work on these file systems, to help improve
+	  them, or to report problems you have with them, please see
+	  the fs_name.README file in the fs/staging/ directory to see
+	  what needs to be worked on, and who to contact.
+
+	  If in doubt, say N here.
+
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#107: FILE: fs/staging/Kconfig:27:
+config FSSTAGING_EXCLUDE_BUILD
+	bool "Exclude Staging file systems from being built" if FSSTAGING
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  Are you sure you really want to build the staging file
+	  systems?  They taint your kernel, don't live up to the
+	  normal Linux kernel quality standards, are a bit crufty
+	  around the edges, and might go off and kick your dog when
+	  you aren't paying attention.
+
+	  Say N here to be able to select and build the Staging file
+	  systems.  This option is primarily here to prevent them from
+	  being built when selecting 'make allyesconfg' and 'make
+	  allmodconfig' so don't be all that put off, your dog will be
+	  just fine.
