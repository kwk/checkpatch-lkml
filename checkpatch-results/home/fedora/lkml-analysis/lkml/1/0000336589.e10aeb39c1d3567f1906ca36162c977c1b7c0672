CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#108: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1011:
+			return (struct extent_map *) handle;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#112: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1015:
+	ret = map_extent_get_block(tree, mapping, start, len, create, gfp_mask,
 					ext3_get_block);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#119: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1022:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
