ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#61: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:364:
+^I/* $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#67: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:370:
+		struct rb_node *next_node = rb_next(&curr->run_node);
+		if (next_node)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
