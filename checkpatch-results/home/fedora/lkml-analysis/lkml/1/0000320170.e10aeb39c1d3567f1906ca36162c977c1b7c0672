CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#100: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce_thermal.h:7:
+extern void mce_log_therm_throt_event(unsigned int cpu, __u64 status);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
