Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pos)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct nvs_page)...)
#89: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/main.c:301:
+		pos = kzalloc(sizeof(struct nvs_page), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
