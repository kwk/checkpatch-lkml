CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#98: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1038:
+extern unsigned long mmap_region(struct file *file, unsigned long addr,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#99: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1039:
+extern unsigned long mmap_region(struct file *file, unsigned long addr,
+	unsigned long len, unsigned long flags,
