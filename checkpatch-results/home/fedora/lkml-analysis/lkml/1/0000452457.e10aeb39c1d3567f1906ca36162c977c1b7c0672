WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#208: FILE: net/ipv6/route.c:418:
+		fn->rr_ptr = rt0 = fn->leaf;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
