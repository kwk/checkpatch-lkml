WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'suppport' may be misspelled - perhaps 'support'?
#32: 
IA64 ftrace suppport. In IA64, below code will be added in each function
            ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#65: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#70: FILE: arch/ia64/include/asm/ftrace.h:1:
+#ifndef _ASM_IA64_FTRACE_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: arch/ia64/include/asm/ftrace.h:8:
+extern void _mcount(unsigned long pfs, unsigned long r1, unsigned long b0, unsigned long r0);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/ftrace.h> instead of <asm/ftrace.h>
#161: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/ia64_ksyms.c:116:
+#include <asm/ftrace.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
