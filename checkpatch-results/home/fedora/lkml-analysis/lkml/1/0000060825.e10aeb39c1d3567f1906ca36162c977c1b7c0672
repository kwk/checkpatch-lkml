Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#240: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.h:464:
+extern int set_ftrace(char *str);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
