CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#100: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:321:
+		if (sd->s_type & SYSFS_KOBJ_ATTR) {
[...]
+		} else if (sd->s_type & SYSFS_KOBJ_BIN_ATTR) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#138: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:168:
+struct inode * sysfs_get_inode(struct sysfs_dirent *sd)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#170: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:198:
+			struct inode *p_inode = dentry->d_parent->d_inode;
+			p_inode->i_mtime = p_inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#170: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:198:
+			p_inode->i_mtime = p_inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#184: FILE: fs/sysfs/sysfs.h:61:
+extern struct inode * sysfs_get_inode(struct sysfs_dirent *sd);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#184: FILE: fs/sysfs/sysfs.h:61:
+extern struct inode * sysfs_get_inode(struct sysfs_dirent *sd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
