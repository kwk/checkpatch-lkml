                                               ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 121 exceeds 100 columns
#103: FILE: drivers/staging/rtl8187se/r8180.h:524:
+	bool	bApBufOurFrame;// TRUE if AP buffer our unicast data , we will keep eAwake until receive data or timeout.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bApBufOurFrame>
#103: FILE: drivers/staging/rtl8187se/r8180.h:524:
+	bool	bApBufOurFrame;// TRUE if AP buffer our unicast data , we will keep eAwake until receive data or timeout.

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#129: FILE: net/bluetooth/bnep/core.c:632:
+		 * This is temporary hack until we have shutdown in L2CAP */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
