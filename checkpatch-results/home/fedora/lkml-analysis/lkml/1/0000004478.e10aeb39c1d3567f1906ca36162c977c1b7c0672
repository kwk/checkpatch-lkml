For your review, this patch adds support for arch-dependent symbolic event names

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#124: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.c:328:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

#126: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.c:330:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
