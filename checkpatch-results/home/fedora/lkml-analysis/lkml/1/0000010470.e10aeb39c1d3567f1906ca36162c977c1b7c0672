WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'atapi_pio_bytes', this function's name, in a string
#86: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-sff.c:1109:
+		ata_port_printk(ap, KERN_INFO, "stat=%x after atapi_pio_bytes\n", stat);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#89: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-sff.c:1112:
+		for (count = 0; (ap->ops->sff_check_status(ap) & ATA_DRQ)
+						&& count < 65536; count += 2)
