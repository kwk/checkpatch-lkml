WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#46: 
# ls -l /proc/net

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Use a single space after Acked-by:
#63: 
Acked-by:  Stephen Smalley <sds@tycho.nsa.gov>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

+	DIR("net",        S_IRUGO|S_IXUSR, net),
 	                         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO|S_IXUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0544'.
#81: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:2277:
+	DIR("net",        S_IRUGO|S_IXUSR, net),

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
