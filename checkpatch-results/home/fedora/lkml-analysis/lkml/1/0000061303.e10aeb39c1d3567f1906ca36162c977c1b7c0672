CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!chip"
#94: FILE: drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:1119:
+		if (chip == NULL || chip->names == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!chip->names"
#94: FILE: drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:1119:
+		if (chip == NULL || chip->names == NULL)

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_notice([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_notice(dev, ... then pr_notice(...  to printk(KERN_NOTICE ...
#97: FILE: drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:1122:
+			printk(KERN_NOTICE "grbn found %d\n", i);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#116: FILE: include/asm-generic/gpio.h:119:
+extern int gpio_lookup(const char *name);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#130: FILE: include/linux/gpio.h:46:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
