WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#53: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#58: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb.c:1:
+#include <linux/init.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/mmu_context.h> instead of <asm/mmu_context.h>
#67: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb.c:10:
+#include <asm/mmu_context.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#72: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb.c:15:
+DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_ALIGNED(struct tlb_state, cpu_tlbstate)
+			= { &init_mm, 0, };

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment
#101: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb.c:44:
+		spinlock_t tlbstate_lock;

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#102: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb.c:45:
+		DECLARE_BITMAP(flush_cpumask, NR_CPUS);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#108: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb.c:51:
+/* State is put into the per CPU data section, but padded
+   to a full cache line because other CPUs can access it and we don't

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#109: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb.c:52:
+   want false sharing in the per cpu data segment. */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#119: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb.c:62:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#209: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb.c:152:
+		if (percpu_read(cpu_tlbstate.state) == TLBSTATE_OK) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#214: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb.c:157:
