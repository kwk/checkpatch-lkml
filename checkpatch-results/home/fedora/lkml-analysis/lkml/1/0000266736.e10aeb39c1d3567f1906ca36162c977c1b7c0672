CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#333: FILE: drivers/media/video/videobuf-core.c:1096:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(__videobuf_mmap_setup);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#398: FILE: drivers/net/cassini.c:2144:
+	if (skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_IP)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#401: FILE: drivers/net/cassini.c:2147:
+	} else

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#416: FILE: drivers/net/forcedeth.c:3116:

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <NvRegMSIIrqMask>
#423: FILE: drivers/net/forcedeth.c:3123:
+		writel(0, base + NvRegMSIIrqMask);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!session"
#470: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:245:
+	if (session == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tunnel"
#489: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:264:
+	if (tunnel == NULL) {

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#678: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:1277:
+		BUG_ON(session->magic != L2TP_SESSION_MAGIC);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "session"
#700: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:1347:
+	if (session != NULL) {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#702: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:1349:
+		struct sk_buff *skb;
+		while ((skb = skb_dequeue(&session->reorder_q))) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#823: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c:3973:
+	 * See comment in b43_remove(). */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#1128: FILE: include/asm-m68k/bitops.h:423:
+	while (*p++ == 0UL)

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
