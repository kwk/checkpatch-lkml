ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#376: FILE: fs/namespace.c:353:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#444: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:368:
+			 struct seq_operations *seq_ops)

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
