Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Macintosh: fix coding style issues in adb.c This is a patch to the adb.c file that cleans up many warnings found by the checkpatch.pl tool. Signed-off-by: Michael Beardsworth <mbeards2@uoregon.edu>

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'adb_controller == NULL'
#143: FILE: drivers/macintosh/adb.c:391:
+	if ((adb_controller == NULL) || (adb_controller->poll == NULL))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'adb_controller->poll == NULL'
#143: FILE: drivers/macintosh/adb.c:391:
+	if ((adb_controller == NULL) || (adb_controller->poll == NULL))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!adb_controller"
#143: FILE: drivers/macintosh/adb.c:391:
+	if ((adb_controller == NULL) || (adb_controller->poll == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!adb_controller->poll"
#143: FILE: drivers/macintosh/adb.c:391:
+	if ((adb_controller == NULL) || (adb_controller->poll == NULL))

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
