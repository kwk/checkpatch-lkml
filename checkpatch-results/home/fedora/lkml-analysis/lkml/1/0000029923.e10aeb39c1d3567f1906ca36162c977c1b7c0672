CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#45: FILE: include/linux/kfifo.h:108:
+extern void kfifo_init(struct kfifo *fifo, void *buffer,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#46: FILE: include/linux/kfifo.h:109:
+extern void kfifo_init(struct kfifo *fifo, void *buffer,
 			unsigned int size);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#87: FILE: kernel/kfifo.c:32:
+static void _kfifo_init(struct kfifo *fifo, void *buffer,
 		unsigned int size)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
