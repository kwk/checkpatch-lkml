CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!input"
#77: FILE: drivers/media/video/ov511.c:368:
+	if (input == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#96: FILE: drivers/media/video/ov511.c:387:
+	if ((ret = input_register_device(input)) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
