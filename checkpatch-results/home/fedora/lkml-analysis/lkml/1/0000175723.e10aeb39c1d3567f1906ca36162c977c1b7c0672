CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#50: FILE: arch/alpha/include/asm/dma-mapping.h:32:
+#include <asm/io.h>	/* for virt_to_phys() */

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
