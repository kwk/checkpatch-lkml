Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cwq->thread"
#91: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:761:
+			alive = (cwq->thread != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_crit([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_crit(dev, ... then pr_crit(...  to printk(KERN_CRIT ...
#98: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:768:
+				printk(KERN_CRIT "ERR!! wq: %s\n", cwq->wq->name);

WARNING:YIELD: Using yield() is generally wrong. See yield() kernel-doc (sched/core.c)
#102: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:772:
