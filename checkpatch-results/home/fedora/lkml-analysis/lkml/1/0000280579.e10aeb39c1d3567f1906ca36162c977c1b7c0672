The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*m41t94)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct m41t94)...)
#191: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-m41t94.c:123:
+	m41t94 = kzalloc(sizeof(struct m41t94), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
