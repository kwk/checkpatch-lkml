WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#53: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#58: FILE: block/blk-iopoll.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'succesful' may be misspelled - perhaps 'successful'?
#88: FILE: block/blk-iopoll.c:31:
+ *     succesful return from blk_iopoll_sched_prep() before calling this.
        ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:MSLEEP: msleep < 20ms can sleep for up to 20ms; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#223: FILE: block/blk-iopoll.c:166:
+	BUG_ON(!test_bit(IOPOLL_F_SCHED, &iop->state));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#250: FILE: block/blk-iopoll.c:193:

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#257: FILE: block/blk-iopoll.c:200:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __cpuinitdata should be placed after blk_iopoll_cpu_notifier
#269: FILE: block/blk-iopoll.c:212:
+static struct notifier_block __cpuinitdata blk_iopoll_cpu_notifier = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#322: FILE: include/linux/blk-iopoll.h:32:
+extern void blk_iopoll_sched(struct blk_iopoll *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
