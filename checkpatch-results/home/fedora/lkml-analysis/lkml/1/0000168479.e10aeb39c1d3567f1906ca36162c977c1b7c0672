Commit 5a6fe125950676015f5108fb71b2a67441755003 brought hugetlbfs more in line

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#200: FILE: mm/hugetlb.c:2294:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#202: FILE: mm/hugetlb.c:2296:
+		struct resv_map *resv_map = resv_map_alloc();
+		if (!resv_map)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
