WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#65: FILE: include/asm-i386/irq.h:27:
+void irq_ctx_init(int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#66: FILE: include/asm-i386/irq.h:28:
+void irq_ctx_exit(int);

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of '__ARCH_HAS_DO_SOFTIRQ' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#67: FILE: include/asm-i386/irq.h:29:
+#define __ARCH_HAS_DO_SOFTIRQ

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.
