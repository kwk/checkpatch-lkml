ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#102: FILE: net/ipv4/icmp.c:397:
+ 	daddr = ipc.addr = ip->saddr;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
