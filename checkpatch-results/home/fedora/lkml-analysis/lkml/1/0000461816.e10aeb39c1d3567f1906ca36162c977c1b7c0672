Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#55: FILE: include/linux/kallsyms.h:28:
+extern void lookup_symbol(unsigned long addr, char *buffer);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
