WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#80: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#85: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#86: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:2:
+ * arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!task"
#156: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:72:
+	if (task == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'parm' may be misspelled - perhaps 'param'?
#201: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:117:
+		 * Try to read optional parameter, pc unchanged if no parm.
 		                                                      ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'initalization' may be misspelled - perhaps 'initialization'?
#248: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:164:
+ *	kgdb_arch_init - Perform any architecture specific initalization.
   	                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'initalization' may be misspelled - perhaps 'initialization'?
#250: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:166:
+ *	This function will handle the initalization of any architecture
   	                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'regsiter' may be misspelled - perhaps 'register'?
#275: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:191:
+ * We regsiter a hook specifically looking for the KGB break inst
       ^^^^^^^^

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct kgdb_arch should normally be const
#279: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:195:
+struct kgdb_arch arch_kgdb_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
#315: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/traps.c:712:

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'much'
#359: FILE: include/asm-arm/kgdb.h:32:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#374: FILE: include/asm-arm/kgdb.h:47:
+extern void kgdb_handle_bus_error(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
