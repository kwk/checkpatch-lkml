ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#184: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/pd6729.c:61:
+static unsigned int irq_list_count = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <num_ModemOption>
#210: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/speedtch.c:91:
+static unsigned int num_ModemOption;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
