CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#230: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:154:
+		if (p->oomkilladj > 0) {
[...]
+			points <<= p->oomkilladj;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#271: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:328:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "tried to kill an mm-less task!\n");

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mm"
#295: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:363:
+	if (mm == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#320: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:397:

+			"gfp_mask=0x%x, order=%d, oomkilladj=%d\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
