#57: FILE: fs/inode.c:890:
+static int test_inode_iunique(struct super_block * sb, struct hlist_head *head, unsigned long ino)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
