WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#80: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc.h:81:
+	/* Note: almost everything apart from _PAGE_PRESENT is
+	   reserved at the pmd (PDPT) level. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#108: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc.h:109:
+	return (pud_t *)get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_REPEAT);
 	                                          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#113: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc.h:114:
+	BUG_ON((unsigned long)pud & (PAGE_SIZE-1));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#113: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc.h:114:
+	BUG_ON((unsigned long)pud & (PAGE_SIZE-1));
 	                                      ^

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#117: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc.h:118:
+extern void __pud_free_tlb(struct mmu_gather *tlb, pud_t *pud);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#129: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
