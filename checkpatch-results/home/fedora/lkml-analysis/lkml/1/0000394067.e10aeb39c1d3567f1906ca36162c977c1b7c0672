WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct fb_ops should normally be const
#178: FILE: drivers/video/efifb.c:62:
+static struct fb_ops efifb_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#202: FILE: drivers/video/efifb.c:86:
+	 *                 memory we need. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
