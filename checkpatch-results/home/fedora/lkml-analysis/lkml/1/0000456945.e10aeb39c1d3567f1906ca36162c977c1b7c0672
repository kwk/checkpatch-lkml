CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#124: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1781:
+extern int generic_segment_checks(const struct iovec *iov,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#125: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1782:
+extern int generic_segment_checks(const struct iovec *iov,

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
