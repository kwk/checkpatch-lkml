CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#1533: FILE: include/linux/socket.h:304:
+extern void socket_seq_show(struct seq_file *seq);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#1851: FILE: include/sound/hdsp.h:19:
  *   Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:ARCH_DEFINES: architecture specific defines should be avoided
#1868: FILE: include/video/edid.h:4:
+#if !defined(__KERNEL__) || defined(__i386__) || defined(__x86_64__)

Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever
possible.
