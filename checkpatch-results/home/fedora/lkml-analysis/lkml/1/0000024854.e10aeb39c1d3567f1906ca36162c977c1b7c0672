WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#53: FILE: include/linux/clk.h:108:
+#define DEFINE_CLK_FIXED(r) { \
+	.clk = { .ops = &clk_fixed_operations }, \
+	.rate = (r) \
+};

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
