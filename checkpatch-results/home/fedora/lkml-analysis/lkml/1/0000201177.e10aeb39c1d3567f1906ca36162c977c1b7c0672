WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Supress' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Suppress'?
#33: 
Supress the warning by passing __GFP_NOWARN option to 'kmalloc()'.
^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*bu)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct bu_info)...)
#57: FILE: fs/ubifs/file.c:708:
+	bu = kmalloc(sizeof(struct bu_info), GFP_NOFS | __GFP_NOWARN);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
