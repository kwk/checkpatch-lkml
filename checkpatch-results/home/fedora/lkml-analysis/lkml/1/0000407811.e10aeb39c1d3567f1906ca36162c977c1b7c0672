ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#111: FILE: drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:56:
+static int use_lro = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
