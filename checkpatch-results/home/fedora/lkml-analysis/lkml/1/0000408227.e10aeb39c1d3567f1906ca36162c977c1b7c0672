WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#87: FILE: fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:674:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "hugetlbfs: Bad mount option: \"%s\"\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#88: FILE: fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:675:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "hugetlbfs: Bad mount option: \"%s\"\n",
+				 p);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#109: FILE: fs/super.c:883:
+	BUG_ON(!mnt->mnt_sb);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
