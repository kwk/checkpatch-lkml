WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .6
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PREFER_DEV_LEVEL: Prefer dev_info(... to dev_printk(KERN_INFO, ...
#248: FILE: drivers/ata/ahci.c:1937:
+		dev_printk(KERN_INFO, &pdev->dev, "enabling ASUS P5W DH "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#249: FILE: drivers/ata/ahci.c:1938:
+		dev_printk(KERN_INFO, &pdev->dev, "enabling ASUS P5W DH "
+			   "Deluxe on-board SIMG4726 workaround\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#304: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-eh.c:1763:
+static int ata_eh_followup_srst_needed(struct ata_port *ap, int rc,
+				int classify, const unsigned int *classes)

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <emptyTimer>
#436: FILE: drivers/char/moxa.c:1049:
+		mod_timer(&moxa_ports[ch->port].emptyTimer,

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#437: FILE: drivers/char/moxa.c:1050:
+		mod_timer(&moxa_ports[ch->port].emptyTimer,
+				round_jiffies(jiffies + HZ));

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#491: FILE: drivers/hwmon/lm87.c:132:
+				 (1350000 + (reg)*(div) / 2) / ((reg)*(div)))
 				                 ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#491: FILE: drivers/hwmon/lm87.c:132:
+				 (1350000 + (reg)*(div) / 2) / ((reg)*(div)))
 				                                     ^

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#500: FILE: drivers/hwmon/lm87.c:148:
+#define CHAN_NO_VID		(1 << 7)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#670: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/serverworks.c:100:
+		case 3:	 mask = 0x3f; break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#910: FILE: drivers/md/bitmap.c:277:
+				    + (long)(page->index * (PAGE_SIZE/512))
 				                                     ^

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#957: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:381:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#958: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:382:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "pending: %#lx ops.pending: %#lx ops.ack: %#lx "
+			"ops.complete: %#lx\n", pending, sh->ops.pending,

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#960: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:384:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#1013: FILE: drivers/scsi/hptiop.c:369:
+		memcpy(&scp->sense_buffer, &req->sg_list,
+				min(sizeof(scp->sense_buffer),

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#1014: FILE: drivers/scsi/hptiop.c:370:
+				min(sizeof(scp->sense_buffer),
+					le32_to_cpu(req->dataxfer_length)));

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#1277: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/generic.c:212:
+		unsigned long flags;
+		spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock, flags);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!info"
#1312: FILE: drivers/video/platinumfb.c:543:
+	if (info == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#1350: FILE: drivers/video/platinumfb.c:568:

#1359: FILE: drivers/video/platinumfb.c:607:

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#1360: FILE: drivers/video/platinumfb.c:608:
+	       (unsigned int) (pinfo->total_vram / 1024 / 1024),

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#1543: FILE: sound/pci/hda/patch_sigmatel.c:196:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
