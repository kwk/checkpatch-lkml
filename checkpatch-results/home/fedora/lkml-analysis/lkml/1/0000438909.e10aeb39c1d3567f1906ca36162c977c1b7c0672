The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/cpufeature.h> instead of <asm/cpufeature.h>
#66: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/sched-clock.c:13:
+#include <asm/cpufeature.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the

as the last construct.
