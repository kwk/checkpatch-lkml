CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "h->pair"
#528: FILE: tools/perf/util/hist.c:647:
+			if (h->pair != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#530: FILE: tools/perf/util/hist.c:649:
+^I^I^I^I^I        (long)position);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
