Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#136: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:82:
+const char ^I^I^I*vmlinux_name;$

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "vmlinux_path"
#232: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1394:
+	if (vmlinux_path != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#234: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1396:
+		int i;
+		pr_debug("Looking at the vmlinux_path (%d entries long)\n",

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#256: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1418:
+		pr_info("The file %s cannot be used, "
+			"trying to use /proc/kallsyms...", self->long_name);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#298: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1499:
+	kernel_map->map_ip	 = kernel_map->unmap_ip = identity__map_ip;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
