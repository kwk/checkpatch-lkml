WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#174: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-pio-blacklist.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#187: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-pio-blacklist.c:14:
+} ide_pio_blacklist [] = {

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#228: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-pio-blacklist.c:55:
+	{ "ST3491A",  1 }, /* reports 3, should be 1 or 2 (depending on drive)
+			      according to Seagate's FIND-ATA program */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "p->name"
#262: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-pio-blacklist.c:89:
+	for (p = ide_pio_blacklist; p->name != NULL; p++) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char *' should also have an identifier name
#276: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1293:
+int ide_scan_pio_blacklist(char *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
