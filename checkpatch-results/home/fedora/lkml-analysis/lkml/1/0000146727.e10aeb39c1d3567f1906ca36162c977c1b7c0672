CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#124: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_core.c:385:
+				if (((work >> 8) & 0x000000FF) == (long) bus_num)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#143: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_core.c:428:
+	if (status == 1)
[...]
-	} else if (status == 0) {
[...]
 		amber_LED_off (ctrl, hp_slot);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#149: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_core.c:432:
+	else {

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around hotplug_slot->info
#172: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_core.c:674:
+		hotplug_slot->info = kzalloc(sizeof(*(hotplug_slot->info)),

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#173: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_core.c:675:
+		hotplug_slot->info = kzalloc(sizeof(*(hotplug_slot->info)),
 							GFP_KERNEL);
