WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'suport' may be misspelled - perhaps 'support'?
#39: 
level suport for disk shock protection. The user interface to this
      ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#95: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:6671:
+	if (unload) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#101: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:6677:
+	} else

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#114: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:6690:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#210: FILE: drivers/ata/libata.h:98:
+extern int ata_protect_dev(struct ata_device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#226: FILE: include/linux/ata.h:402:
+	 * both and only return zero if none of them indicates otherwise. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
