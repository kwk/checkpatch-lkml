WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#47: FILE: arch/x86/mm/hugetlbpage.c:139:
+			BUG_ON(sz != PMD_SIZE);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#50: FILE: arch/x86/mm/hugetlbpage.c:142:
+			pte = (pte_t *) pmd_alloc(mm, pud, addr);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
