CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#375: FILE: include/linux/fb.h:1074:
+extern int fb_set_user_cmap(struct fb_cmap_user *cmap, struct fb_info *info);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
