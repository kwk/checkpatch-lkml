CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#42: FILE: kernel/irq/proc.c:79:
+static int irq_spurious_read(char *page, char **start, off_t off,
+				  int count, int *eof, void *data)

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#44: FILE: kernel/irq/proc.c:81:
+	struct irq_desc *d = &irq_desc[(long) data];

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#45: FILE: kernel/irq/proc.c:82:
+	struct irq_desc *d = &irq_desc[(long) data];
+	return sprintf(page, "count %u\n"

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
