CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:34:
+extern void mem_container_move_lists(struct meta_page *mp, bool active);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#172: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:162:
+		if (!list_empty(&mp->lru))
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#200: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:190:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
