CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/linux/migrate.h:15:
+extern int migrate_pages(struct list_head *l, new_page_t x,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#92: FILE: include/linux/migrate.h:16:
+extern int migrate_pages(struct list_head *l, new_page_t x,
+			unsigned long private, int offlining);

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#104: FILE: include/linux/migrate.h:30:
+		unsigned long private, int offlining) { return -ENOSYS; }

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
