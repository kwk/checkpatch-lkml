WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#85: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/tlbflush.h:18:
+#include <asm/processor.h>	/* For TASK_SIZE */

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/tlbflush.h:23:
+extern void _tlbie(unsigned long address);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/tlbflush.h:24:
+extern void _tlbia(void);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#100: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/tlbflush.h:33:
+static inline void local_flush_tlb_page(struct vm_area_struct *vma,
+				unsigned long vmaddr)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#103: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/tlbflush.h:36:
+static inline void local_flush_tlb_range(struct vm_area_struct *vma,
+		unsigned long start, unsigned long end)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#121: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/tlbflush.h:54:
+static inline void flush_tlb_pgtables(struct mm_struct *mm,
+	unsigned long start, unsigned long end) { }
