Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#276: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/numa.c:386:
+						simple_strtol(cmdline, NULL, 0));

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
