#35: 
kstat_irqs related, so only CONFIG_DYN_ARRAY/SPARSE_IRQ will have kstat_irqs in irq_desc

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#95: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/irq_alpha.c:67:
+^I^I        kstat_cpu(cpu).irqs[RTC_IRQ]++;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
