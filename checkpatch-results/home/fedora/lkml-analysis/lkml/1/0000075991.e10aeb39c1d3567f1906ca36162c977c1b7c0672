WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#59: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2x00.h:817:
+	BUG_ON(word < 1 || word > rt2x00dev->ops->rf_size / sizeof(u32));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
