CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:31:
+extern int cgroup_lock_is_held(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 130 exceeds 100 columns
#100: FILE: include/linux/cred.h:283:
+	((const struct cred *)(rcu_dereference_check((task)->real_cred, rcu_read_lock_held() || lockdep_is_held(&tasklist_lock))))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#138: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:181:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(cgroup_lock_is_held);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#163: FILE: kernel/exit.c:175:
+	 * can't be modifying its own credentials. But shut RCU-lockdep up */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
