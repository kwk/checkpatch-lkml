CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: drivers/usb/core/hcd.h:254:
+extern void usb_hcd_poll_urb_irq(struct urb *urb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#118: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/console.c:191:
+				 const char *buf, unsigned count)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#124: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/console.c:197:
+	/* pass on to the driver specific version of this function if
+	   it is available */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
