WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#119: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:3055:
+				seq_printf( m, " boxes=%d width=%d", boxes, pB->i2eDataWidth16 ? 16 : 8 );

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
