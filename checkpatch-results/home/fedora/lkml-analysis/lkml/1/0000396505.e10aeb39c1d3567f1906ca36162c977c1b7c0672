ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#153: FILE: drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:55:
+static int use_lro = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#174: FILE: drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:87:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
