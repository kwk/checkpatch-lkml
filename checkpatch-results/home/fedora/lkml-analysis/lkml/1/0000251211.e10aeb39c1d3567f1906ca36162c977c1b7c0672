CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#57: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:29:
+#define CH341_BIT_RTS (1 << 6)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#58: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:30:
+#define CH341_BIT_DTR (1 << 5)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#73: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:45:
+/* status returned in third interrupt answer byte, inverted in data
+   from irq */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#73: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:45:
+   from irq */

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#98: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:70:
+	unsigned baud_rate; /* set baud rate */

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ch341_set_handshake', this function's name, in a string
#171: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:140:
+	dbg("ch341_set_handshake(0x%02x)", control);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#194: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:162:
+	if (r == 2) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#200: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:168:
+	} else

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#246: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:264:
+static void ch341_close(struct usb_serial_port *port, struct file *filp)
                                                                    ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#273: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:291:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#303: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:321:
+		dev_err(&port->dev, "%s - failed submitting interrupt urb,"
+			" error %d\n", __func__, r);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#384: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ch341.c:395:
+	struct usb_serial_port *port = (struct usb_serial_port *) urb->context;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
