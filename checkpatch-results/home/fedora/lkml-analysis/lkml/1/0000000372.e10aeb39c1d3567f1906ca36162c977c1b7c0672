CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#393: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1846:
+extern void move_task_off_dead_cpu(int dead_cpu, struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
