#30: 
add throttle to shrink_zone() for performance improvement and prevent incorrect oom.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'cutted' may be misspelled - perhaps 'cut'?
#79: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:77:
+	/* Can shrink be cutted off if other task freeded enough page. */
 	                 ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#110: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1207:
+	wait_event(zone->reclaim_throttle_waitq,
+		 atomic_add_unless(&zone->nr_reclaimers, 1, MAX_RECLAIM_TASKS));

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#113: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1210:
+	/* in some situation (e.g. hibernation), shrink processing shouldn't be
+	   cut off even though large memory freeded.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
