WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#95: FILE: drivers/firewire/fw-ohci.c:1462:
+		return ERR_PTR(-ENOSYS);

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/
