Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#874: FILE: sound/oss/vidc.h:36:
+extern irqreturn_t vidc_sound_dma_irq(void *ref);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
