WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#88: FILE: drivers/char/Kconfig:870:
+config I8K
+	tristate "Dell laptop support"
+	depends on X86
+	---help---
+	  This adds a driver to safely access the System Management Mode
+	  of the CPU on the Dell Inspiron 8000. The System Management Mode
+	  is used to read cpu temperature and cooling fan status and to
+	  control the fans on the I8K portables.
+
+	  This driver has been tested only on the Inspiron 8000 but it may
+	  also work with other Dell laptops. You can force loading on other
+	  models by passing the parameter `force=1' to the module. Use at
+	  your own risk.
+
+	  For information on utilities to make use of this driver see the
+	  I8K Linux utilities web site at:
+	  <http://people.debian.org/~dz/i8k/>
+
+	  Say Y if you intend to run this kernel on a Dell Inspiron 8000.
+	  Say N otherwise.
