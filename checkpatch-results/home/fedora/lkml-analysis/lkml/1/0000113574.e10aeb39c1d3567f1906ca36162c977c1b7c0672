  - no dev_t info for the output of plug, unplug_timer and unplug_io events.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'deivce' may be misspelled - perhaps 'device'?
#51: 
    This is mainly because we can't get the deivce from a request queue.
                                            ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
