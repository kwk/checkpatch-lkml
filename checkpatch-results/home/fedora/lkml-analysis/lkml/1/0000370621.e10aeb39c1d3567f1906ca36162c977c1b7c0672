CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/mpc52xx.h:270:
+extern int mpc52xx_pm_prepare(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+extern void mpc52xx_pm_finish(void);

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#129: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/52xx/lite5200_pm.c:207:
+	if (lite5200_pm_target_state == PM_SUSPEND_STANDBY) {
+		mpc52xx_pm_finish();
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct platform_suspend_ops should normally be const
#136: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/52xx/lite5200_pm.c:212:
+static struct platform_suspend_ops lite5200_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
