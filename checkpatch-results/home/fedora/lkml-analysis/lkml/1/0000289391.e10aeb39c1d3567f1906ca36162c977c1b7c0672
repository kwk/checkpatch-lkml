CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sb->s_op->write_super_lockfs"
#149: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:195:
+		if (sb->s_op->write_super_lockfs == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#252: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1934:
+extern void put_super(struct super_block *sb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct block_device *' should also have an identifier name
#254: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1936:
+extern struct super_block *get_super_without_lock(struct block_device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
