CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#180: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/mtrr.h:57:
+extern int __init common_num_var_ranges(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#194: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#199: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/xen.c:1:
+#include <linux/init.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#204: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/xen.c:6:
+#include <asm/uaccess.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#217: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/xen.c:19:
+ * working userland mtrr support. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct mtrr_ops should normally be const
#218: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/xen.c:20:
+static struct mtrr_ops xen_mtrr_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
