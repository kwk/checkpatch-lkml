CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#65: FILE: drivers/xen/xenbus/xenbus_probe.c:852:
+		xen_store_mfn = xen_start_info->store_mfn =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#75: FILE: drivers/xen/xenbus/xenbus_probe.c:862:
+		if (err == -ENOSYS)

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#78: FILE: drivers/xen/xenbus/xenbus_probe.c:865:
+		BUG_ON(err);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
