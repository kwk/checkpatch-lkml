CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#56: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mmu_context.h:24:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#68: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mmu_context.h:36:
+	unsigned cpu = smp_processor_id();

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#89: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mmu_context.h:57:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#91: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mmu_context.h:59:
+		BUG_ON(percpu_read(cpu_tlbstate.active_mm) != next);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#112: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mmu_context.h:80:
+#define deactivate_mm(tsk, mm)			\
+do {						\
+	loadsegment(gs, 0);			\
+} while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.
