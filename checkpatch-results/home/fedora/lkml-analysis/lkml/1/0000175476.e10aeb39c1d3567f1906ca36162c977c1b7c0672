WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#109: FILE: drivers/uio/uio_aec.c:16:
+ *   with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*info)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct uio_info)...)
#178: FILE: drivers/uio/uio_aec.c:85:
+	info = kzalloc(sizeof(struct uio_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
