#31: 
Some time ago we discussed the possibility of simplifying the swsusp's approach

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around swsusp_extents.rb_node
#114: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:90:
+	struct rb_node **new = &(swsusp_extents.rb_node);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ext)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct swsusp_extent)...)
#164: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:118:
+	ext = kzalloc(sizeof(struct swsusp_extent), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "swsusp_extents.rb_node"
#233: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:173:
+	return (swsusp_extents.rb_node != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#271: FILE: kernel/power/power.h:147:
+extern sector_t alloc_swapdev_block(int swap);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#272: FILE: kernel/power/power.h:148:
+extern void free_all_swap_pages(int swap);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#273: FILE: kernel/power/power.h:149:
+extern int swsusp_swap_in_use(void);
