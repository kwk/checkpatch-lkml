WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after of_bus_ids[]
#104: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/embedded6xx/linkstation.c:58:
+static __initdata struct of_device_id of_bus_ids[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1377655732.3619.19.camel@joe-AO722/

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct of_device_id should normally be const
#104: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/embedded6xx/linkstation.c:58:
+static __initdata struct of_device_id of_bus_ids[] = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
