#232: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spufs/inode.c:20:
  * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'uid_t' should also have an identifier name
#1527: FILE: include/linux/cred.h:119:
+struct user_struct *find_user(uid_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct user_namespace *' should also have an identifier name
