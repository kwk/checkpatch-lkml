WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#44: FILE: drivers/isdn/hardware/eicon/message.c:9030:
+	if (esc_chi[0] && !(esc_chi[esc_chi[0]] & 0x7f))
   {
     add_i[0] = (byte   *)"\x02\x02\x00"; /* use neither b nor d channel */
   }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
