# HG changeset patch

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: include/asm-x86/page.h:201:
+extern int page_is_ram(unsigned long pagenr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#85: FILE: include/asm-x86/page.h:204:
