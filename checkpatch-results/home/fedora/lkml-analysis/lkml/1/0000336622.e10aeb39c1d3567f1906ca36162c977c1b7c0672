#74: 
  introduction of head32.o (which seems like a win to introduce for readability)

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#139: FILE: arch/x86/Makefile:42:
+        include $(srctree)/arch/x86/Makefile_32.cpu

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
