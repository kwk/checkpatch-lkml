WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'invokation' may be misspelled - perhaps 'invocation'?
#33: 
This patch replaces boot_ioremap invokation with bt_ioremap and
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#71: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/srat_32.c:340:
+			bt_ioremap(saved_rsdt.table.table_offset_entry[i], sizeof(struct acpi_table_header));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
