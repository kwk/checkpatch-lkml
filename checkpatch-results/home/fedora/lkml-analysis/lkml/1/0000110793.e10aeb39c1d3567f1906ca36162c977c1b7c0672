CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#120: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/perf_counter.h:67:
+extern void set_perf_counter_pending(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
#166: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/time.c:539:
+#define clear_perf_counter_pending()	__get_cpu_var(perf_counter_pending) = 0
