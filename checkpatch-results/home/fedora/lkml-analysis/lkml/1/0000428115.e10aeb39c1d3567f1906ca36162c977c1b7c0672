WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#68: FILE: arch/i386/xen/enlighten.c:799:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after xen_machine_ops
#91: FILE: arch/i386/xen/enlighten.c:822:
+static const struct machine_ops __initdata xen_machine_ops = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1377655732.3619.19.camel@joe-AO722/

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of const init definition must use __initconst
#91: FILE: arch/i386/xen/enlighten.c:822:
+static const struct machine_ops __initdata xen_machine_ops = {

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.
