ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I * explicitly asked for. But for now, send all. $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#214: FILE: arch/cris/arch-v32/boot/compressed/misc.c:154:
+	while (!rs.tr_rdy);/* Wait for transceiver. */

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:WHILE_AFTER_BRACE: while should follow close brace '}'
#214: FILE: arch/cris/arch-v32/boot/compressed/misc.c:154:
 	}
+	while (!rs.tr_rdy);/* Wait for transceiver. */

while should follow the closing bracket on the same line::

  do {
          ...
  } while(something);
