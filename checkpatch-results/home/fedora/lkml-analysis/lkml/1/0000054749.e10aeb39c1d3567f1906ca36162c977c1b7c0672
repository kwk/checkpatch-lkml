CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#137: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:4311:
+static void perf_hw_breakpoint_handler(struct hw_breakpoint *bp,
+					struct pt_regs *regs)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#170: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:4344:
+static const struct pmu *hw_breakpoint_perf_event_init(struct perf_event *event,

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#177: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:4351:
+	bp = event->hw.bp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct hw_breakpoint), gfpflags);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*event->hw.bp)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct hw_breakpoint)...)
#177: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:4351:
+	bp = event->hw.bp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct hw_breakpoint), gfpflags);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#182: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:4356:
+	switch (event_id) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
