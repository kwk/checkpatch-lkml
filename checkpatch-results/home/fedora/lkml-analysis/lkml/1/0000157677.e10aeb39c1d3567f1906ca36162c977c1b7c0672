WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#44: FILE: fs/aufs/loop.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!current->mm"
#86: FILE: fs/aufs/loop.c:43:
+	return current->mm == NULL

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
