CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <GElf_Nhdr>
#113: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:960:
+		GElf_Nhdr nhdr;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#125: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:972:
+			if (memcmp(bf, "GNU", sizeof("GNU")) == 0) {
[...]
+			} else if (read(fd, bf, descsz) != descsz)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#127: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:974:
+				if (read(fd, build_id,
+				    BUILD_ID_SIZE) == BUILD_ID_SIZE) {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#135: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:982:
+			int n = namesz + descsz;
+			if (read(fd, bf, n) != n)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
