#29: 
multiple pages.  This patch introduces a nolock version of isolate_lru_page()

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/linux/migrate.h:30:
+extern int locked_isolate_lru_page(struct zone *zone, struct page *p,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#48: FILE: include/linux/migrate.h:31:
+extern int locked_isolate_lru_page(struct zone *zone, struct page *p,
+						struct list_head *pagelist);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#58: FILE: include/linux/migrate.h:47:
+static inline int locked_isolate_lru_page(struct zone *zone, struct page *p,
+						struct list_head *list)

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#60: FILE: include/linux/migrate.h:49:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
