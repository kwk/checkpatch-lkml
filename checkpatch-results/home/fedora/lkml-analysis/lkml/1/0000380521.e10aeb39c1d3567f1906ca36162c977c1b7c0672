Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'finish_unfinished', this function's name, in a string
#76: FILE: fs/reiserfs/super.c:288:
+				reiserfs_warning(s, "Dead loop in finish_unfinished detected, just remove save link\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#77: FILE: fs/reiserfs/super.c:289:
+^I^I^I^Iretval = remove_save_link_only(s, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
