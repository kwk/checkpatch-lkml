Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#73: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:40:
+static int			verbose				= 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#90: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:361:
+			error("sys_perf_counter_open() syscall returned with %d (%s)\n",
 				fd[nr_cpu][counter], strerror(err));

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#101: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:371:
+		if (attr->type == PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE
+			&& attr->config == PERF_COUNT_CPU_CYCLES) {

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#102: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:372:
+			&& attr->config == PERF_COUNT_CPU_CYCLES) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
