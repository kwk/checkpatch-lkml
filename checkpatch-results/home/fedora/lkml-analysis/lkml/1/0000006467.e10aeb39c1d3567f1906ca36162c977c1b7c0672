Subject: [PATCH 25/66] arch/h8300/include/asm/target_time.h: Checkpatch cleanup

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: arch/h8300/include/asm/target_time.h:3:
+extern void platform_gettod(unsigned int *year, unsigned int *mon, unsigned int *day,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#48: FILE: arch/h8300/include/asm/target_time.h:4:
+extern void platform_gettod(unsigned int *year, unsigned int *mon, unsigned int *day,
+				unsigned int *hour, unsigned int *min, unsigned int *sec);
