that we're over the global rmem limit. This will prevent SOCK_MEMALLOC buffers

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern int sk_stream_mem_schedule(struct sock *sk, struct sk_buff *skb,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#49: FILE: include/net/sock.h:747:
+extern int sk_stream_mem_schedule(struct sock *sk, struct sk_buff *skb,
