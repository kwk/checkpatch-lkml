WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#51: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#56: FILE: fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Elf32_Addr>
#91: FILE: fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c:36:
+#define elf_addr_t	Elf32_Addr

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#108: FILE: fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c:53:
+	struct timeval tv;
+	cputime_to_timeval(cputime, &tv);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#116: FILE: fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c:61:

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_SETUP_ADDITIONAL_PAGES' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#169: FILE: fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c:114:
+#define ARCH_HAS_SETUP_ADDITIONAL_PAGES 1

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.
