#40: 
nested cr8 accesses need alway be handled by the nested
                         ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#87: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:1855:
+	/* We don't want a nested guest to be more powerful than the guest,
+	   so all intercepts are ORed */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
