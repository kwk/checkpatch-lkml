WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#570: FILE: tools/perf/builtin.h:378:
+++ b/tools/perf/builtin.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#576: FILE: tools/perf/builtin.h:26:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
