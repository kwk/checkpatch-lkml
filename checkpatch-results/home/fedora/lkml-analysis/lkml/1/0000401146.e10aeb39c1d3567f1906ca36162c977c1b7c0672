WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#45: FILE: drivers/char/watchdog/mv64x60_wdt.c:50:
+MODULE_PARM_DESC(nowayout, "Watchdog cannot be stopped once started (default=" __MODULE_STRING(WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT) ")");

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
