WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .45
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#105: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c:3465:
+static DRIVER_ATTR(poll_mode_io, S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR,
                                         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#105: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c:3465:
+static DRIVER_ATTR(poll_mode_io, S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:MSLEEP: msleep < 20ms can sleep for up to 20ms; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#118: FILE: drivers/usb/core/hub.c:3019:
+					msleep(10);

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#162: FILE: drivers/usb/host/ehci-hub.c:135:
+				ehci_dbg(ehci, "suspend failed because "
+						"port %d is resuming\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#227: FILE: drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c:762:
+	else if (hcd->self.root_hub->do_remote_wakeup &&
+			uhci->resuming_ports) {

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#229: FILE: drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c:764:
+		dev_dbg(uhci_dev(uhci), "suspend failed because a port "
+				"is resuming\n");

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#231: FILE: drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c:766:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#300: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/file.c:206:
+	if ((ecryptfs_inode_to_private(inode)->lower_file->f_flags & O_RDONLY)
+	    && !(file->f_flags & O_RDONLY)) {

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#302: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/file.c:208:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: Lower persistent file is RO; eCryptfs "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#303: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/file.c:209:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: Lower persistent file is RO; eCryptfs "
+		       "file must hence be opened RO\n", __func__);
