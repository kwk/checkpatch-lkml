ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros starting with if should be enclosed by a do - while loop to avoid possible if/else logic defects
#58: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:60:
+#define nsvm_printk(fmt, args...)	\
+	if (nested_dbg)			\
+		printk(KERN_INFO fmt, ## args)

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)
