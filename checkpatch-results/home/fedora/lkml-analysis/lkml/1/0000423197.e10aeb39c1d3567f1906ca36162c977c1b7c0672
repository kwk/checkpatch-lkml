Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#72: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/Kconfig:277:
+config JOYSTICK_XPAD_LEDS
+	bool "LED Support for Xbox360 controller 'BigX' LED"
+	depends on LEDS_CLASS && JOYSTICK_XPAD_FF
+	---help---
+	  This option enables support for the LED which surrounds the Big X on
+	  XBox 360 controller.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *       bar" should be "foo *bar"
#112: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/xpad.c:476:
+	struct usb_xpad *       xpad;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#131: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/xpad.c:495:
+static void xpad_led_set(struct led_classdev *led_cdev,
+	enum led_brightness value)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*new_led)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct xpad_led)...)
#160: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/xpad.c:524:
+	new_led = kzalloc(sizeof(struct xpad_led), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#166: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/xpad.c:530:
+	name = kzalloc(sizeof(char)*7, GFP_KERNEL);
 	                           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#184: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/xpad.c:548:
+	xpad_send_command( (i % 4) + 2, xpad);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#221: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/xpad.c:585:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
