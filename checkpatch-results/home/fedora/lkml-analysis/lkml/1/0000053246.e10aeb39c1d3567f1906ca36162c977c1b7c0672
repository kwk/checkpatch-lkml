#68: 
Since kthread_bind() messes with scheduler internals, move the body to sched.c,

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#90: FILE: kernel/kthread.c:152:
+extern void sched_kthread_bind(struct task_struct *k, unsigned int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
