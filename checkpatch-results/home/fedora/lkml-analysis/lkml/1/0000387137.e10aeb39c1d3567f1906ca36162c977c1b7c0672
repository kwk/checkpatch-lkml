WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#74: FILE: drivers/block/nbd.c:123:
+	 * calling socket ops directly here */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#126: FILE: drivers/block/nbd.c:185:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#224: FILE: drivers/block/nbd.c:444:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
