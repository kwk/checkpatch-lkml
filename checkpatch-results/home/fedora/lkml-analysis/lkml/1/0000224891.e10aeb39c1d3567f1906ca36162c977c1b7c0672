ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#107: FILE: posixtestsuite/conformance/interfaces/sigaction/10-1.c:22:
+int child_continued = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#190: FILE: posixtestsuite/conformance/interfaces/sigaction/10-1.c:97:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
