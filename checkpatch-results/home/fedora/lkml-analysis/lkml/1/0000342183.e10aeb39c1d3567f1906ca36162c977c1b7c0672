WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#50: FILE: include/asm-cris/arch-v32/cache.h:13:
+#define flush_dma_context(c) \
+  flush_dma_list(phys_to_virt((c)->saved_data));

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
