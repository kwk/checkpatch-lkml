WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'occured' may be misspelled - perhaps 'occurred'?
#35: 
no build changes occured.
                 ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#54: FILE: arch/x86/boot/compressed/Makefile:2:
+# linux/arch/x86/boot/compressed/Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'vmlinux'
#59: FILE: arch/x86/boot/compressed/Makefile:7:
+targets := vmlinux vmlinux.bin vmlinux.bin.gz head_$(BITS).o misc_$(BITS).o piggy.o

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#119: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.
