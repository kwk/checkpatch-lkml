+	---help---
+	The GRU is a hardware resource located in the system chipset. The GRU
+	contains memory that can be mmapped into the user address space. This memory is
+	used to communicate with the GRU to perform functions such as load/store,
+	scatter/gather, bcopy, AMOs, etc.  The GRU is directly accessed by user
+	instructions using user virtual addresses. GRU instructions (ex., bcopy) use
+	user virtual addresses for operands.
+
+	If you are not running on a SGI UV system, say N.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
