CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#120: FILE: kernel/panic.c:197:
+	if (tainted_mask) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __cpuinitdata should be placed after unsafe_smp
#311: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:282:
+static int __cpuinitdata unsafe_smp;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
