#33: 
the PixelView PlayTV card definition structure was missing initialization of the tuner_addr and radio_addr fields. As a result it was impossible to have the tuner initialized using parameters specified while loading the bttv.ko module. This regression became visible after the v4l rearrangements introduced somewhere around 2.6.15 kernel version. The root cause for the tuner initialization failure is located in the attach_inform function in the bttv-i2c.c file. There at the very beginning the addr variable holding the tuner device address is initialized with the value taken from the bttv_tvcards array. For the PixelView PlayTV card the tuner address field (and the radio address as well) was uninitialized, and thus equal 0. Later in that function execution of the TUNER_SET_TYPE_ADDR tuner command is guarded with check for the tuner address either equal ADDR_UNSET, or client->addr. Since both are non-zero (the latter in case of   the card owned by me at the runtime is equal 0x61) the TUNER_SET_TYPE_ADDR command is not executed, and consequently in the tuner_attach function in the tuner-core.c file call to i2c_attach_client does not result in assigning the tuner type variable with the requested value. Providing initialization of the tuner_addr and radio_addr with ADDR_UNSET values as it is already done for other tv cards defined in bttv-cards.c ensures that the tuner initialization is done correctly, just as it used to be in the 2.6.14 kernel.
