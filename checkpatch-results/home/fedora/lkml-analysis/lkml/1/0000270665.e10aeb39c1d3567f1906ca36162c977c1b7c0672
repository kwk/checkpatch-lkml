WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct tty_operations should normally be const
#55: FILE: arch/cris/arch-v10/kernel/debugport.c:435:
+static struct tty_operations dummy_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
