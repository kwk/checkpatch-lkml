ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#85: FILE: drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:56:
+static int prop_carrier_state = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#99: FILE: drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:70:
+MODULE_PARM_DESC(prop_carrier_state, "Propagate carrier state of physical "
+		 "port to stack. 1:yes, 0:no.  Default = 0 ");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'port->phy_link == EHEA_PHY_LINK_UP'
#108: FILE: drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:821:
+	if (!prop_carrier_state || (port->phy_link == EHEA_PHY_LINK_UP))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
