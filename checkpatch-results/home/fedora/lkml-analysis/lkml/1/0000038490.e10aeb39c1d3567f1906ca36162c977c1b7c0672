#35: 
commit 9a3f45116f5e08819136cd512fd7f6450ac22aa8 upstream.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#93: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43/dma.c:1370:
+	 * into the skb data or cb now. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
