Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#91: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:896:
+	queue_charge = group_charge = served;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#121: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:956:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(elv_fairness_show);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#194: FILE: block/elevator-fq.h:460:
+extern ssize_t elv_fairness_show(struct elevator_queue *q, char *name);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
