Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead
#76: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:310:
+	synchronize_sched();

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.
