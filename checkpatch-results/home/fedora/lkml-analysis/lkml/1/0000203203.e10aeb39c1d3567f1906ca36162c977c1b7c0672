CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#64: FILE: fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c:34:
+	inode->i_uid = inode->i_gid = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
