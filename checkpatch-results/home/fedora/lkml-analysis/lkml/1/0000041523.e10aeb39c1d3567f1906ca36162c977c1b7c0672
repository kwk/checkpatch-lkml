CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#161: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1726:
+extern void thread_group_times(struct task_struct *p, cputime_t *ut, cputime_t *st);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#290: FILE: kernel/sched.c:5244:
+	if (total) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
