CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+void __init add_highpages_with_active_regions(int nid, unsigned long start_pfn,
+					unsigned long end_pfn, int bad_ppro)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: include/asm-x86/highmem.h:77:
+extern void add_highpages_with_active_regions(int nid, unsigned long start_pfn,
