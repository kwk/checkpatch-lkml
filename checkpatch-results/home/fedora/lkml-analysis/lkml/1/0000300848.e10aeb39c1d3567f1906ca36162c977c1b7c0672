Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - int arch_stack_can_recurse() should probably be int arch_stack_can_recurse(void)
#137: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/process.c:61:
+int arch_stack_can_recurse()

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#166: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1603:
+extern int arch_stack_can_recurse(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
