ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':

  case 'M':
  case 'm':

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#171: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/tsc.c:301:
+	mark_tsc_sched_clock_unstable((char*)d->ident);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'check_tsc_sync_source', this function's name, in a string
#251: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/tsc_sync.c:141:
+		mark_tsc_sched_clock_unstable("check_tsc_sync_source failed");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'flaged' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flagged'?

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
