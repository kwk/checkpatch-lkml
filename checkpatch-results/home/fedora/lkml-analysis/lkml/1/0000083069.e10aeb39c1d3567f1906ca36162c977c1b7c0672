WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#60: FILE: include/linux/bootmem.h:146:
+					 * shift passed via *_hash_shift */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __meminitdata should be placed after nr_kernel_pages
#106: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:126:
+static unsigned long __meminitdata nr_kernel_pages;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#116: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:4731:
+		if (unlikely(flags & HASH_SMALL)) {
[...]
+		} else if (unlikely((numentries * bucketsize) < PAGE_SIZE))

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#121: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:4736:
+				BUG_ON(!numentries);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
