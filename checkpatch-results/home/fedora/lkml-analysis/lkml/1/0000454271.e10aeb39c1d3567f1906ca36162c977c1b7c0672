everything is still valid: neigh->dev, neigh->parms etc.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct neighbour *' should also have an identifier name
#92: FILE: include/net/neighbour.h:39:
+	void	(*neigh_cleanup)(struct neighbour *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
