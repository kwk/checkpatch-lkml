CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'dest' - possible side-effects?
#89: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/irq_remapping.h:4:
+#define IRTE_DEST(dest) ((x2apic_mode) ? dest : dest << 8)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#120: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1337:
+		x2apic_preenabled = x2apic_mode = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#242: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic/probe_64.c:54:
+	if (x2apic_mode && (apic != &apic_x2apic_phys &&
 #ifdef CONFIG_X86_UV
