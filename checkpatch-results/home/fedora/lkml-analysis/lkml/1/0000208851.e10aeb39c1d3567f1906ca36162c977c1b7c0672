CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/audit.h:456:
+extern int __audit_log_bprm_fcaps(struct linux_binprm *bprm, kernel_cap_t *pP, kernel_cap_t *pE);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#79: FILE: include/linux/audit.h:507:
+static inline int audit_log_bprm_fcaps(struct linux_binprm *bprm, kernel_cap_t *pP, kernel_cap_t *pE)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#122: FILE: kernel/auditsc.c:1388:
+			struct audit_aux_data_bprm_fcaps *axs = (void *)aux;
+			audit_log_format(ab, "fver=%x", axs->fcap_ver);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <fE>
#125: FILE: kernel/auditsc.c:1391:

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
