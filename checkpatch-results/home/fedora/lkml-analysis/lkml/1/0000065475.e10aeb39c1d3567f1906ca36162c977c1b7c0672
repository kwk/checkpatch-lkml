WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#110: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#115: FILE: drivers/power/wm831x_backup.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#276: FILE: drivers/power/wm831x_backup.c:162:

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*devdata)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct wm831x_backup)...)
#283: FILE: drivers/power/wm831x_backup.c:169:
+	devdata = kzalloc(sizeof(struct wm831x_backup), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!devdata"
#284: FILE: drivers/power/wm831x_backup.c:170:
+	if (devdata == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
