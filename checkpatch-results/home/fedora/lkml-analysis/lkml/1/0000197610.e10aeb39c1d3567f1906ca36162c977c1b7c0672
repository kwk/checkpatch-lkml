CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#133: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/highlevel.c:490:
+	host->dummy_zero_addr.op = host->dummy_max_addr.op = &dummy_ops;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#137: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/highlevel.c:492:
+	host->dummy_zero_addr.start = host->dummy_zero_addr.end = 0;

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#138: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/highlevel.c:493:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
