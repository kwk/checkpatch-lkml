#127: 
This patch fixes the driver by ensuring the maple callback is called properly.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#161: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:49:
 static int __devinit probe_maple_mouse(struct device *dev)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*mse)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dc_mouse)...)
#178: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:60:
+	mse = kzalloc(sizeof(struct dc_mouse), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
