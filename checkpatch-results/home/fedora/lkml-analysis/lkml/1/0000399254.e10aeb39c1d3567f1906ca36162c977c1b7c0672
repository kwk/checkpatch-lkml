#33: 
module's build that was stored there at compile time (e.g. by ld --build-id).

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Elf_Shdr>
#105: FILE: kernel/module.c:1092:
+			    char *secstrings, Elf_Shdr *sechdrs)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'sechdrs[i].sh_type == SHT_NOTE'
#114: FILE: kernel/module.c:1101:
+		if ((sechdrs[i].sh_flags & SHF_ALLOC) &&
+		    (sechdrs[i].sh_type == SHT_NOTE))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!notes_attrs"
#124: FILE: kernel/module.c:1111:
+	if (notes_attrs == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#134: FILE: kernel/module.c:1121:
+			nattr->attr.mode = S_IRUGO;

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#136: FILE: kernel/module.c:1123:
+			nattr->private = (void *) sechdrs[i].sh_addr;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
