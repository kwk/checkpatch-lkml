CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#120: FILE: include/linux/time.h:99:
+extern void __update_xtime_seconds(unsigned long new_xtime_seconds);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
