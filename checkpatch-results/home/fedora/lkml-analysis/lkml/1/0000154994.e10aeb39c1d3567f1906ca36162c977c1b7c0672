commit 9e973e64ac6dc504e6447d52193d4fff1a670156 upstream.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#122: FILE: drivers/block/xen-blkfront.c:242:
+	BUG_ON(ring_req->nr_segments > BLKIF_MAX_SEGMENTS_PER_REQUEST);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
