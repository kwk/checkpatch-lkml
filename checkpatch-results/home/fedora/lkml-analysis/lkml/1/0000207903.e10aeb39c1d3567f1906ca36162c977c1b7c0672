#35: 
Minimal changes to the core input system. The bulk of IR support loads as a module. These changes are passive if the rest of IR isn't loaded.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 112 exceeds 100 columns

+#define EVIOIRSEND		_IOC(_IOC_WRITE, 'E', 0x80, sizeof(struct ir_command))	/* send an IR command */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
