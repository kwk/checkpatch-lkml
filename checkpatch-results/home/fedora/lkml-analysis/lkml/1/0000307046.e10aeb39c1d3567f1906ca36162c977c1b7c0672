WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#124: FILE: drivers/acpi/osl.c:96:
+extern struct acpi_table_header *acpi_find_dsdt_initrd(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <CopyFileMem>
#220: FILE: init/initramfs.c:133:
+	CopyFileMem,

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#244: FILE: init/initramfs.c:319:
+	static void *file_current; /* current position in the file */
+	if (file_mem == NULL) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!file_mem"
#244: FILE: init/initramfs.c:319:
+	if (file_mem == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
