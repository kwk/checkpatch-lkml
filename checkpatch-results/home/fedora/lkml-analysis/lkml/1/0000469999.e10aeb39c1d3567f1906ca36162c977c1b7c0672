--- a/kernel/rcutorture.c~rcutorture-remove-redundant-assignment-to-cur_ops-in

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

as the last construct.
