CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#92: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/irq.h:45:
+extern int vector_used_by_percpu_irq(unsigned int vector);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
