WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct linux_binprm *' should also have an identifier name
#115: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/elf.h:208:
+int arch_setup_additional_pages(struct linux_binprm *, unsigned long, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#193: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h:342:
+extern int syscall32_setup_pages(struct linux_binprm *, unsigned long start, int exstack);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
