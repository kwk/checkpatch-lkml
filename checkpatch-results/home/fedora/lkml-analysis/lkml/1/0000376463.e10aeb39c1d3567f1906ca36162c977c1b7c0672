WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#59: FILE: fs/unionfs/debug.c:433:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#148: FILE: fs/unionfs/union.h:539:
+extern void __unionfs_check_nd(const struct nameidata *nd,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
