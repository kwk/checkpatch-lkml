>>> Crashes during boot on a box with Phenom X4 and AMD 790-based mainboard.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#145: FILE: include/linux/scatterlist.h:238:
+#define SG_MITER_ATOMIC		(1 << 0)	 /* use kmap_atomic */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#337: FILE: lib/scatterlist.c:387:
+		if (miter->__flags & SG_MITER_ATOMIC) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
