WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#117: FILE: mm/slub.c:2761:
+			BUG_ON(atomic_read(&n->nr_slabs));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'necssary' may be misspelled - perhaps 'necessary'?
