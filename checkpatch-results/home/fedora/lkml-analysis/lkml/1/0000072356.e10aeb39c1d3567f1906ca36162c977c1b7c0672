Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#114: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-sched.c:41:
+#define BUG_ON(x)		assert(!(x))

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#249: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-sched.c:156:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
