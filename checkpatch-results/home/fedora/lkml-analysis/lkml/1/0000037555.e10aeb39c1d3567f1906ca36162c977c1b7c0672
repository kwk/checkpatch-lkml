The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#210: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/toshiba_bluetooth.c:70:
+	if (!ACPI_FAILURE(res1) || !ACPI_FAILURE(res2)) {
+		return 0;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

+	---help---
+	  This driver adds support for Bluetooth events for the RFKill
+	  switch on modern Toshiba laptops with full ACPI support and
+	  an RFKill switch.
+
+	  This driver handles RFKill events for the TOS6205 Bluetooth,
+	  and re-enables it when the switch is set back to the 'on'
+	  position.
+
+	  If you have a modern Toshiba laptop with a Bluetooth and an
+	  RFKill switch (such as the Portege R500), say Y.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
