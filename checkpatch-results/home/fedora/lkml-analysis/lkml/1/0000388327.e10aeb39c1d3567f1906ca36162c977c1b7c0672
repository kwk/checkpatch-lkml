CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ctrl_classes"
#65: FILE: drivers/media/video/v4l2-common.c:1513:
+		if (*ctrl_classes == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#69: FILE: drivers/media/video/v4l2-common.c:1517:
+		while (*pctrl && *pctrl != id) pctrl++;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
