CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hwif"
#284: FILE: drivers/ide/cris/ide-cris.c:784:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#391: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:675:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of const init definition must use __initconst
#414: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/ali14xx.c:56:

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
