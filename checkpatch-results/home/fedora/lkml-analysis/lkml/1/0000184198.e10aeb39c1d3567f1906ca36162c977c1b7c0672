#34: 
for NOMMU.  It's feasible that the ARM version may wish to use my global one

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*new)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct arm_vm_region)...)
#86: FILE: arch/arm/mm/dma-mapping.c:95:
+	new = kmalloc(sizeof(struct arm_vm_region), gfp);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#117: FILE: arch/arm/mm/dma-mapping.c:218:
+	c = arm_vm_region_alloc(&consistent_head, size,
 			    gfp & ~(__GFP_DMA | __GFP_HIGHMEM));
