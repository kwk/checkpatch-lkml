+config USB_STORAGE_CYPRESS_ATACB
+	bool "SAT emulation on Cypress USB/ATA Bridge with ATACB"
+	depends on USB_STORAGE
+	---help---
+	  Say Y here if you want to use SAT (ata pass through) on devices based
+	  on the Cypress USB/ATA bridge supporting ATACB. This will allow you
+	  to use tools to tune and monitor your drive (like hdparm or smartctl).
+
+	  If you say no here your device will still work with the standard usb
+	  mass storage class.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#201: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/cypress_atacb.c:92:
+	else { /* ATA12 */

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
