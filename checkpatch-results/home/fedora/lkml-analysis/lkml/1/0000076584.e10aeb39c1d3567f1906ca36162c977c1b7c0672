#194: FILE: drivers/dma/ioat/dma.c:521:

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#211: FILE: drivers/dma/ioat/dma.c:542:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
