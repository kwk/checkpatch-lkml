CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#198: FILE: fs/union.c:393:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#231: FILE: fs/union.c:518:
+	 * bytes or something */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#262: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:2109:
+extern int __inode_permission(struct inode *inode, int mask, int rofs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#274: FILE: include/linux/union.h:61:
+extern int union_permission(struct path *, int);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct path *' should also have an identifier name
#274: FILE: include/linux/union.h:61:
+extern int union_permission(struct path *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
