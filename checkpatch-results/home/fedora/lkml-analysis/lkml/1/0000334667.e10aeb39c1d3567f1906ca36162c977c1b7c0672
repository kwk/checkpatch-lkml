editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'do_get_write_access', this function's name, in a string
#684: FILE: fs/jbd/transaction.c:552:
+	set_latency_reason("EXT3 (jbd) do_get_write_access", &reason);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
