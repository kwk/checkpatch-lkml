Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#420: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pat.c:73:
+		BUG_ON(boot_pat_state);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#465: FILE: include/asm-x86/bitops.h:26:
+#define ADDR "=m" (*(volatile long *) addr)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst

+#define ADDR "=m" (*(volatile long *) addr)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#585: FILE: include/asm-x86/geode.h:189:
+extern int geode_has_vsa2(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#630: FILE: include/asm-x86/pat.h:9:
+extern void validate_pat_support(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c);

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#632: FILE: include/asm-x86/pat.h:11:
+static const int pat_wc_enabled = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
