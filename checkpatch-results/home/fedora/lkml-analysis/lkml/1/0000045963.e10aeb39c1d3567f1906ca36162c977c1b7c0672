Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#370: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/usbtouchscreen.c:642:
+		switch (buf[0]) {
+			case 0x83:	/* firmware version */
[...]
+			case 0x84:	/* device name */

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':

          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*usbtouch->priv)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct nexio_priv)...)
#385: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/usbtouchscreen.c:657:
+	usbtouch->priv = kmalloc(sizeof(struct nexio_priv), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#421: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/usbtouchscreen.c:693:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#445: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/usbtouchscreen.c:717:
+	begin_x = end_x = begin_y = end_y = -1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#466: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/usbtouchscreen.c:738:
+/*					input_report_abs(usbtouch->input,
+						    ABS_MT_TOUCH_MAJOR, max(w,h));

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#475: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/usbtouchscreen.c:747:

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#487: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/usbtouchscreen.c:759:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
