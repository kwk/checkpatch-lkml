CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#234: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_functions.c:151:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#236: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_functions.c:153:
+static struct ftrace_ops trace_ops __read_mostly =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
