Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+static void cfq_service_tree_add(struct cfq_data *cfqd,
+				    struct cfq_queue *cfqq)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#503: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:1012:
+	BUG_ON(!list_empty(&cfqq->fifo));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
