#37: 
2. removed hard coded driver data, now we get it from PCI bar1 (platform init code fills it)

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#69: FILE: drivers/gpio/Kconfig:170:
+config GPIO_LANGWELL

 comment "SPI GPIO expanders:"
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#88:

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
