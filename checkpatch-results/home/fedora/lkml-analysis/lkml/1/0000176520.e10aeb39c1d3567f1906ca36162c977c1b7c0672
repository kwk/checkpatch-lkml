Subject: [PATCH 1/6] [Target_Core_Mod]: Add support for configurable EVPD Unit Serial Numbers

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'task' may be better as '(task)' to avoid precedence issues

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 131 exceeds 100 columns
#169: FILE: drivers/lio-core/target_core_transport.h:169:
+extern int transport_generic_emulate_inquiry (struct se_cmd_s *, unsigned char, unsigned char *, unsigned char *, unsigned char *);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#169: FILE: drivers/lio-core/target_core_transport.h:169:
+extern int transport_generic_emulate_inquiry (struct se_cmd_s *, unsigned char, unsigned char *, unsigned char *, unsigned char *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct se_cmd_s *' should also have an identifier name
#169: FILE: drivers/lio-core/target_core_transport.h:169:
+extern int transport_generic_emulate_inquiry (struct se_cmd_s *, unsigned char, unsigned char *, unsigned char *, unsigned char *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned char' should also have an identifier name
