WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#50: FILE: drivers/staging/Kconfig:25:
+config STAGING_EXCLUDE_BUILD
+	bool "Exclude Staging drivers from being built"
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  Are you sure you really want to build the staging drivers?
+	  They taint your kernel, don't live up to the normal Linux
+	  kernel quality standards, are a bit crufty around the edges,
+	  and might go off and kick your dog when you aren't paying
+	  attention.
+
+	  Say N here to be able to select and build the Staging drivers.
+	  This option is primarily here to prevent them from being built
+	  when selecting 'make allyesconfg' and 'make allmodconfig' so
+	  don't be all that put off, your dog will be just fine.
