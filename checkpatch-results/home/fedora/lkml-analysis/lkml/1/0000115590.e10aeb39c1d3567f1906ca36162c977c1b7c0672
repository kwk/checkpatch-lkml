CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#110: FILE: include/linux/mfd/asic3.h:20:
+extern void asic3_set_extcf_select(struct device *dev, u32 bits, int value);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
