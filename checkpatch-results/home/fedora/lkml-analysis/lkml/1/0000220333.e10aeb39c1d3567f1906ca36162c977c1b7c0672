#48: 
too small value of the HPET minumum delta for programming an event.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#52: 
added the minimum delta to the current time and tried to reprogram the device.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: kernel/time/tick-internal.h:20:
+extern int tick_dev_program_event(struct clock_event_device *dev,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
