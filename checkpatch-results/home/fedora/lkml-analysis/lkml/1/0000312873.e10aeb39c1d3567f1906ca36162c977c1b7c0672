#48: FILE: include/linux/iommu-helper.h:1:
+extern int iommu_is_span_boundary(unsigned int index, unsigned int nr,

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/iommu-helper.h:1:
+extern int iommu_is_span_boundary(unsigned int index, unsigned int nr,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#69: FILE: lib/iommu-helper.c:47:
+	BUG_ON(!is_power_of_2(boundary_size));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
