CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#121: FILE: drivers/video/atmel_lcdfb.c:104:
+	bl->props.fb_blank = bl->props.power = sinfo->bl_power = power;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct backlight_ops should normally be const
#133: FILE: drivers/video/atmel_lcdfb.c:116:
+static struct backlight_ops atmel_lcdc_bl_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
