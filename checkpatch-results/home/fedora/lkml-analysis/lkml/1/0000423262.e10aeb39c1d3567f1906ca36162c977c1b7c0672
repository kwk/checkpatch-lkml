ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#55: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_mc.c:1460:
'idx'.

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#62: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_mc.c:1467:
+struct mem_ctl_info * edac_mc_find(int idx)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#97: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_mc.h:433:
+extern struct mem_ctl_info * edac_mc_find(int idx);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
