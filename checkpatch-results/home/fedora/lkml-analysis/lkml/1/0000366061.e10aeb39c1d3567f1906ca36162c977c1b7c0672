WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#48: FILE: drivers/media/video/usbvision/usbvision-core.c:2245:
+	if(mutex_lock_interruptible(&usbvision->lock)) {
+		return;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
