ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

__user *p,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: fs/compat.c:1457:
+		ts.tv_sec = ts.tv_nsec = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#186: FILE: fs/select.c:180:
+	if (timeval) {
[...]
+	} else if (!copy_to_user(p, &rts, sizeof(rts)))
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#210: FILE: fs/select.c:204:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#223: FILE: include/linux/poll.h:121:
+extern int poll_select_set_timeout(struct timespec *to, long sec, long

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
