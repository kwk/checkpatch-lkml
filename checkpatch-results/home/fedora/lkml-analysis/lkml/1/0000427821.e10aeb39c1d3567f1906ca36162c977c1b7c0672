.... But Eric and Peter asked me for some of the functionality included here.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#118: FILE: mm/slub.c:2427:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#120: FILE: mm/slub.c:2429:
+	per_cpu = kzalloc(nr_node_ids * sizeof(unsigned long), GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#127: FILE: mm/slub.c:2436:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
