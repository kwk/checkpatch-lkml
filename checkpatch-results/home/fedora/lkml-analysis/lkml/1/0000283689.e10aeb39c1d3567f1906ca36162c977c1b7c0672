CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: include/linux/bitmap.h:113:
+extern int bitmap_scnprintf_len(unsigned int nr_bits);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#72: FILE: lib/bitmap.c:326:
+	unsigned int nr_nibbles = ALIGN(nr_bits, 4) / 4;
+	return nr_nibbles + ALIGN(nr_nibbles, CHUNKSZ / 4) / (CHUNKSZ / 4) - 1;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
