ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following enum go on the same line
#59: FILE: include/linux/lockdep.h:43:
+enum lock_contention_event
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: include/linux/lockdep.h:268:
+extern void lock_contended(struct lockdep_map *lock, enum lock_contention_event,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
