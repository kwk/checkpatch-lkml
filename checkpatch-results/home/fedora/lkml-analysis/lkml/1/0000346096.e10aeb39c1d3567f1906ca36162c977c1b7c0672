The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'dependant' may be misspelled - perhaps 'dependent'?
#119: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_sis.c:348:
+		   the higher bits are dependant on the device */
 		                       ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#119: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_sis.c:348:
+		   the higher bits are dependant on the device */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
