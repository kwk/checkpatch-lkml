CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SCpnt>
#78: FILE: drivers/scsi/eata.c:1629:
+	if (!scsi_sg_count(SCpnt)) {

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#85: FILE: drivers/scsi/eata.c:1636:
+	BUG_ON(!count);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
