CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!desc->chip"
#66: FILE: drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:179:
+	if (desc->chip == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: include/asm-generic/gpio.h:78:
+extern int gpio_is_valid(int number);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
