WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#51: FILE: security/tomoyo/environ.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#52: FILE: security/tomoyo/environ.c:2:
+ * security/tomoyo/environ.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#80: FILE: security/tomoyo/environ.c:30:
+ * tomoyo_is_globally_usable_env - Check whether the given environment variable is acceptable for all domains.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
