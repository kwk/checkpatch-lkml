WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns

+static void Mds_HeaderCopy(struct wbsoft_priv * adapter, struct wb35_descriptor *pDes, u8 *TargetBuffer)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#67: FILE: drivers/staging/winbond/mds.c:321:
+static void Mds_HeaderCopy(struct wbsoft_priv * adapter, struct wb35_descriptor *pDes, u8 *TargetBuffer)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
