Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:119:
+extern void get_avenrun(unsigned long *loads, unsigned long offset, int shift);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
