ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_CRC32C_HW' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#146: FILE: include/asm-x86/processor.h:781:
+#define ARCH_HAS_CRC32C_HW	1

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
