CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#376: FILE: include/linux/raid/md.h:98:
+extern void md_wait_for_blocked_rdev(mdk_rdev_t *rdev, mddev_t *mddev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
