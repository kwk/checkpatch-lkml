Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#68: FILE: include/linux/netfilter/xt_ipvs.h:1:
+#ifndef _XT_IPVS_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#99: FILE: net/netfilter/Kconfig:681:
+config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_IPVS

+	depends on IP_VS
+	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
+	help
+	  This option allows you to match against IPVS properties of a packet.

+	  If unsure, say N.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
