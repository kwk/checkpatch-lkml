Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#176: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc_uv.c:152:
+	BUG_ON(ret != BIOS_STATUS_SUCCESS);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*mq)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct xpc_gru_mq_uv)...)
#198: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc_uv.c:172:
+	mq = kmalloc(sizeof(struct xpc_gru_mq_uv), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mq"
#199: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc_uv.c:173:
+	if (mq == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'xpc_create_gru_mq_uv', this function's name, in a string
#200: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc_uv.c:174:
+		dev_err(xpc_part, "xpc_create_gru_mq_uv() failed to kmalloc() "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:OOM_MESSAGE: Possible unnecessary 'out of memory' message
