WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#51: 
# To create a hierarchy called "foo" containing the "cpu" subsystem

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

# To mount the "foo" hierarchy on a second location

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#179: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:898:
+				char c = name[i];
+				if (isalnum(c))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'opts->subsys_bits != root->subsys_bits'
#252: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:1028:
+	if (opts->subsys_bits && (opts->subsys_bits != root->subsys_bits))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#290: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:1065:
+	BUG_ON(!opts->subsys_bits);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
