Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+				        * sleep, must not fail */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#298: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:472:
+	raw_notifier_call_chain(&cpu_chain, val, (void*)(long)cpu);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
