WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'verions' may be misspelled - perhaps 'versions'?
#38: 
The static verions in MIPS and SCORE are also made global.
           ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __weak over __attribute__((weak))
#64: FILE: kernel/resource.c:305:
+int __attribute__((weak)) page_is_ram(unsigned long pfn)

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#66: FILE: kernel/resource.c:307:
+	return 24 == walk_system_ram_range(pfn, 1, NULL, __is_ram);

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:191:
+extern int page_is_ram(unsigned long pfn);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
