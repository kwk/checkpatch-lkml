#37: 
When during sys_swapon() the ->swapon() method is found and returns no error

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:278:
+extern void swap_sync_page(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#99: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:312:
+extern struct swap_info_struct *page_swap_info(struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#277: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:1841:
+	swp_entry_t swap = { .val = page_private(page) };
+	BUG_ON(!PageSwapCache(page));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#277: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:1841:
+	BUG_ON(!PageSwapCache(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'successfull' may be misspelled - perhaps 'successful'?
