CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

+#define BC_HT1000_PIC_REGS_ENABLE	(1<<0)
                                  	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#50: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1425:
+#define BC_HT1000_PIC_REGS_ENABLE	(1<<0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 135 exceeds 100 columns

+DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_EARLY(PCI_VENDOR_ID_SERVERWORKS,   PCI_DEVICE_ID_SERVERWORKS_HT1000SB, 	quirk_disable_broadcom_boot_interrupt);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
