CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#90: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlmglue.c:106:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#91: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlmglue.c:107:
+#define mlog_meta_lvb(__level, __lockres) ocfs2_dump_meta_lvb_info(__level, __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, __LINE__, __lockres)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
