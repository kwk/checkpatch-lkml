ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tape->act_data_rq"
#445: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:989:
+	if (tape->act_data_rq == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#527: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1500:
+	if (tape->speed_ctl == 0) {
[...]
+	} else if (tape->speed_ctl == 1) {
[...]
+				(tape->pipe_hspeed - 500) * 2 *
[...]
-		tape->max_insert_speed = tape->pipeline_head_speed * empty / 100 +
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#621: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1635:
+	pc->rq_xfer = pc->buf_size = length * tape->blk_sz;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#1486: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:3736:
+	BUG_ON(tape->first_stage != NULL || tape->merge_stage_sz);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
