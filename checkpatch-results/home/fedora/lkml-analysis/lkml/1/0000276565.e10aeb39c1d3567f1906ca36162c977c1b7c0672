Framebuffer is heavily BKL dependant at the moment so just wrap the ioctl

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct fb_ops should normally be const
#54: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:1021:
+	struct fb_ops *fb;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#157: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:1091:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
