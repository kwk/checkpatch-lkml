#35: 
Add a bool IGB_DCA defined to y if IGB and DCA are enabled, but IGB isn't y while DCA=m.  And thus remove the need to select INTEL_IOATDMA when IGB is enabled, so that non-x86 architectures can build the igb driver.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#53: FILE: drivers/net/Kconfig:2006:
+config IGB_DCA
+	bool "Enable DCA"
+	default y
+	depends on IGB && DCA && !(IGB=y && DCA=m)
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
