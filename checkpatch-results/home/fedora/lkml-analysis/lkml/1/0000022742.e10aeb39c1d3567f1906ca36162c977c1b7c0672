CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/uv/bios.h:100:
+extern int uv_bios_set_legacy_vga_target(bool decode, int domain, int bus);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#116: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic/x2apic_uv_x.c:565:
+int uv_set_vga_state(struct pci_dev *pdev, bool decode,
+		      unsigned int command_bits, bool change_bridge)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
