ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#92: 
--- a/fs/namespace.c~use-ilog2-in-fs-namespacec-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#99: FILE: fs/namespace.c:35:
+#define HASH_SIZE (1UL << HASH_SHIFT)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
