WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#92: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1179:
+		tty_line = simple_strtoul(str, &str, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#99: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1186:

+				!p->poll_init(p, tty_line, str)) {

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#100: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1187:
+				!p->poll_init(p, tty_line, str)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#153: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1760:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#237: FILE: drivers/serial/kgdboc.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#238: FILE: drivers/serial/kgdboc.c:2:
+ * drivers/serial/kgdboc.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'inteface' may be misspelled - perhaps 'interface'?
#241: FILE: drivers/serial/kgdboc.c:5:
+ * driver uses a console polling api to implement a gdb serial inteface
                                                                ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct kgdb_io should normally be const
#259: FILE: drivers/serial/kgdboc.c:23:
+static struct kgdb_io		kgdboc_io_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct uart_port *' should also have an identifier name
#503: FILE: include/linux/serial_core.h:216:
+	int		(*poll_get_char)(struct uart_port *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#548: FILE: include/linux/tty_driver.h:244:
+extern struct tty_driver *tty_find_polling_driver(char *name, int *line);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
