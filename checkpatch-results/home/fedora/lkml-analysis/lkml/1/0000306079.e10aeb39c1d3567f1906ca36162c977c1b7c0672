CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#120: FILE: include/linux/time.h:119:
+extern void getrawmonotonic(struct timespec *ts);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#222: FILE: kernel/time/timekeeping.c:235:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(getrawmonotonic);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
