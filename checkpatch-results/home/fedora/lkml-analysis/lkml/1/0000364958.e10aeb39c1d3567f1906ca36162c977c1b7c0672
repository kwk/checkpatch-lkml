WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'gdth_get_status', this function's name, in a string
#62: FILE: drivers/scsi/gdth.c:1340:
+    TRACE(("gdth_get_status() irq %d ctr_count %d\n", ha->irq, gdth_ctr_count));

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#74: FILE: drivers/scsi/gdth.c:1523:
+        __gdth_interrupt(ha, true, &wait_index);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
