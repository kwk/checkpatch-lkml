WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#181: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:101:
+#define writeback_debug_report(n, wbc) do {                               \
+	__writeback_debug_report(n, wbc, __FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNCTION__); \
+} while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'throttle_vm_writeout', this function's name, in a string
#224: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:540:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "throttle_vm_writeout: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
