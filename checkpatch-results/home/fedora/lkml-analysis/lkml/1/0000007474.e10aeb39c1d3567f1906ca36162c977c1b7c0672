CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#185: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/uv/uv.h:14:
+extern void uv_nmi_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/nmi.h> instead of <asm/nmi.h>
#241: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/x86_init.c:16:
+#include <asm/nmi.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
