CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#166: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/es7000/wakecpu.h:29:
+extern void __inquire_remote_apic(int apicid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#183: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/genapic_32.h:5:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
