WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#124: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c:1320:
+static struct file_operations *stat_fops[] = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
