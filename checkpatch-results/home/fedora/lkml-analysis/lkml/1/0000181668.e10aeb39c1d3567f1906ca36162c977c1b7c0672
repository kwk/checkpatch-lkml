CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#100: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.c:299:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!host->data"
#125: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.c:385:
+	if ((host->data == NULL && !host->response_busy) || cmd->error) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!host->mrq"
#134: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.c:450:
+	if (host->mrq == NULL) {
