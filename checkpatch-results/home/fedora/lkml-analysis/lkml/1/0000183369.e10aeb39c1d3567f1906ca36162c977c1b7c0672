#30: 
ioremap_wc was taking in unsigned long parameter, where as it should take 64

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/io.h:94:
+extern void __iomem *ioremap_wc(resource_size_t offset, unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
