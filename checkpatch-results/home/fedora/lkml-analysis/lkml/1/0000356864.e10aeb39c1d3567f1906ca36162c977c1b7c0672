The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
