#34: 
This patch adds the dma_ops functions for mapping and unmapping scatter gather

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#89: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:742:
+		if (s->dma_address) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#111: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:764:
+		s->dma_address = s->dma_length = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
