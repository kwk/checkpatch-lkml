WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ridr *' should also have an identifier name
#46: FILE: include/linux/ridr.h:46:
+int ridr_pre_get(struct ridr *, gfp_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'gfp_t' should also have an identifier name
#46: FILE: include/linux/ridr.h:46:
+int ridr_pre_get(struct ridr *, gfp_t);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#95: FILE: lib/ridr.c:51:
+		struct ridr_layer *new;
+		new = kmem_cache_alloc(ridr_layer_cache, gfp_mask);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!new"
#96: FILE: lib/ridr.c:52:
+		if (new == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
