#39: 
At present, I re-arranged my w90x900 series platform architectures, adding 'dev.c' which was used to define the common platform device struct and adding  the 'cpu.c' file to implement the common CPU function API, and for the function of specific CPU that were implemented in other file, such as nuc950.c, w90p910.c, due to there are six CPU patches will added to the mach-w90x900, so I think it was distinct to do above.
