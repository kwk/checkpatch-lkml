CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: include/linux/ptrace.h:97:
+extern void exit_ptrace(struct task_struct *tracer);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'childs' may be misspelled - perhaps 'children'?
#205: FILE: kernel/ptrace.c:239:
+ * Called with irqs disabled, returns true if childs should reap themselves.
                                               ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#210: FILE: kernel/ptrace.c:244:
+	int ret;
+	spin_lock(&sigh->siglock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#211: FILE: kernel/ptrace.c:245:
+	ret = (sigh->action[SIGCHLD-1].sa.sa_handler == SIG_IGN) ||
 	                           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#212: FILE: kernel/ptrace.c:246:
+	      (sigh->action[SIGCHLD-1].sa.sa_flags & SA_NOCLDWAIT);
 	                           ^

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#290: FILE: kernel/ptrace.c:333:
+	BUG_ON(!list_empty(&tracer->ptraced));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
