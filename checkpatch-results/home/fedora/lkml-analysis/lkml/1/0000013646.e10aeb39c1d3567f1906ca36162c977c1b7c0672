WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#58: FILE: drivers/staging/dream/pmem.c:94:
+#define DLOG(fmt, args...) \
 	do { printk(KERN_INFO "[%s:%s:%d] "fmt, __FILE__, __func__, __LINE__, \
 		    ##args); } \
 	while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
