The following changes since commit 559595a985e106d2fa9f0c79b7f5805453fed593:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#84: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/smp.h:149:
+extern void arch_send_call_function_ipi_mask(const struct cpumask *mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#306: FILE: arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c:782:
+			printk("-%u", nr_cpu_ids - 1);
