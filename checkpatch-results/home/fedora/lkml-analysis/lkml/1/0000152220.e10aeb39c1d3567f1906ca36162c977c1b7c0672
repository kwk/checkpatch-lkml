CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:181:
+extern int pci_setup_device(struct pci_dev *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#108: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:725:
+	/* Assume 32-bit PCI; let 64-bit PCI cards (which are far rarer)
+	   set this higher, assuming the system even supports it.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
