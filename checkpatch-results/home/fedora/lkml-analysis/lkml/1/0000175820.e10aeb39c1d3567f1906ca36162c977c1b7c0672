WARNING:STRLCPY: Prefer strscpy over strlcpy - see: https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAHk-=wgfRnXz0W3D37d01q3JFkr_i_uTL=V6A6G1oUZcprmknw@mail.gmail.com/

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#92: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/rtc.c:274:
+	if (strict_strtoul(i2c[1], 0, &num))

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#104: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/rtc.c:286:
+	if (c && c->driver == NULL) {
+		i2c_unregister_device(c);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!c->driver"
#104: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/rtc.c:286:
+	if (c && c->driver == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
