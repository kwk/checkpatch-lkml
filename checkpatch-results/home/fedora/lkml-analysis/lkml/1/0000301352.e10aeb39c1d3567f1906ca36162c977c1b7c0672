CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#64: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr-test.c:169:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#117: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:157:
+	BUG_ON(irqs_disabled());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#137: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:177:
+			clflush_cache_range((void *) *addr, PAGE_SIZE);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
