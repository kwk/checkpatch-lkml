   returns the next cgroup under "root" by scanning bitmap (not by tree-walk)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#220: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:599:
+	BUG_ON(err);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
