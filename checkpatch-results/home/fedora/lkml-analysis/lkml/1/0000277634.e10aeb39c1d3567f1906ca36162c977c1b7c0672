WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#49: FILE: fs/Kconfig:1077:
+source "fs/aufs/Kconfig"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#100: FILE: include/linux/namei.h:77:
+struct dentry * __lookup_hash(struct qstr *name, struct dentry * base, struct nameidata *nd);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
