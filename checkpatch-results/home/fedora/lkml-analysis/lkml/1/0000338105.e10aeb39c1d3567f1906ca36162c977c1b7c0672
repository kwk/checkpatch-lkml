CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#78: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-acpi.c:73:
+	printk(KERN_NOTICE"%s detected - disable ACPI _PSx.\n", id->ident);

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#98: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-acpi.c:93:
+	static int done;
+	if (done)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#153: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/trm290.c:2:
+ *  linux/drivers/ide/pci/trm290.c		Version 1.05	Dec. 26, 2007

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
