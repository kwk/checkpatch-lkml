Subject: input: add a DMI table for the i8042.reset option; make MSI Wind U-100 work

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after i8042_dmi_reset_table[]
#69: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042-x86ia64io.h:458:
+static struct dmi_system_id __initdata i8042_dmi_reset_table[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
