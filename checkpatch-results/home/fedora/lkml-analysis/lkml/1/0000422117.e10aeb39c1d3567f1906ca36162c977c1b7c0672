ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#61: 
--- a/Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c~taskstats-add-context-switch-counters-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#96: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:405:
+						if (print_task_context_switch_counts)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 118 exceeds 100 columns
#97: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:406:
+							task_context_switch_counts((struct taskstats *) NLA_DATA(na));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
