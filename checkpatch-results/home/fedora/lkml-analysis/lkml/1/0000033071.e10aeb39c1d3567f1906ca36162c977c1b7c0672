Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'n' may be better as '(n)' to avoid precedence issues
#109: FILE: kernel/sched_debug.c:288:
+#define P64(n) SEQ_printf(m, "  .%-30s: %Ld\n", #n, rq->n);

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#109: FILE: kernel/sched_debug.c:288:
+#define P64(n) SEQ_printf(m, "  .%-30s: %Ld\n", #n, rq->n);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
