WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#54: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pat.c:189:
+	/*    effective type		        ret_prot
+	  pat \ mtrr  WB WC UC		pat \ mtrr  WB  WC  UC

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#60: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pat.c:195:
+	if (pat_type == _PAGE_CACHE_WC)
[...]
-	} else if (pat_type == _PAGE_CACHE_UC_MINUS) {
[...]
 		*ret_prot = prot | _PAGE_CACHE_UC_MINUS;
[...]
-		   mtrr_type == MTRR_TYPE_UNCACHABLE) {
[...]
+		if (mtrr_type == MTRR_TYPE_WRBACK)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#82: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pat.c:209:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
