WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'part_size_show' to 'size_show'
#64: FILE: block/genhd.c:796:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(size, S_IRUGO, part_size_show, NULL);

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#64: FILE: block/genhd.c:796:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(size, S_IRUGO, part_size_show, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:580:
+extern ssize_t part_size_show(struct device *dev,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
