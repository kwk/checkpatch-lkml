Subject: [PATCH] pata_artop: move code to be re-used by ide2libata to pata_artop.h

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#296: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_artop.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#506: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_artop.h:211:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
