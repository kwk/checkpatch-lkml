Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#113: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:740:
+	if (nfs_write_pageuptodate(page, inode) &&
+			inode->i_flock == NULL &&

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!inode->i_flock"
#113: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:740:
+			inode->i_flock == NULL &&

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
