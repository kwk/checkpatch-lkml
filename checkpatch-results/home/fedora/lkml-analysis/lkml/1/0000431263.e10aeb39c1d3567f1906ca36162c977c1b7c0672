WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+ * __iomem to quieten sparse. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#148: FILE: include/linux/lguest_bus.h:32:
+void lguest_unmap(void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
