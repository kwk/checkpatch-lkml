WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#101: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#106: FILE: net/9p/trans_pci.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#107: FILE: net/9p/trans_pci.c:2:
+ * net/9p/trans_pci.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#125: FILE: net/9p/trans_pci.c:20:
+ *  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20131006222342.GT19510@leaf/

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#151: FILE: net/9p/trans_pci.c:46:
+#define MAX_PCI_BUF		(4*1024) /* TODO: Get a number from lucho */
                    		  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#163: FILE: net/9p/trans_pci.c:58:

+static struct p9pci_trans *p9pci_trans; /* single channel for now */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*trans)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct p9_trans)...)
#267: FILE: net/9p/trans_pci.c:162:
+	trans = kmalloc(sizeof(struct p9_trans), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#390: FILE: net/9p/trans_pci.c:285:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
