WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#82: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mmu_context_64.h:34:
+		BUG_ON(x86_read_percpu(cpu_tlbstate.active_mm) != next);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#152: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb_32.c:8:
+DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_ALIGNED(struct tlb_state, cpu_tlbstate)
+			= { &init_mm, 0, };

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
