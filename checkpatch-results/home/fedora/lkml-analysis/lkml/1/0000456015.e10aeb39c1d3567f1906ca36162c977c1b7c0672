ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#95: FILE: fs/aio.c:967:
+		if ((ret = asyncfd_add_results(iocb->ki_asyncfd, &asr, 1)) != 1) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#101: FILE: fs/aio.c:973:

+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
