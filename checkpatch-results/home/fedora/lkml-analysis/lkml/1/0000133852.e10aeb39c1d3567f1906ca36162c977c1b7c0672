#63: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/unistd.h:1:
+#ifndef __MICROBLAZE_UNISTD_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of '__ARCH_HAVE_MMU' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#68: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/unistd.h:4:
+#define __ARCH_HAVE_MMU

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.
