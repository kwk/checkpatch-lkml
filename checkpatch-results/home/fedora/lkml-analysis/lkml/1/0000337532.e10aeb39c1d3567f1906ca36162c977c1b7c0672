WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct hpsb_host *' should also have an identifier name
#430: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/nodemgr.c:1788:
+	int (*cb)(struct hpsb_host *, void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#433: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/nodemgr.c:1791:
+static int __nodemgr_for_each_host(struct device *dev, void *data)
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
