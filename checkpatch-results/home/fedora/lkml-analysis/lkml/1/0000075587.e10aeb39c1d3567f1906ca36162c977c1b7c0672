WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'childs' may be misspelled - perhaps 'children'?
#93: 
task childs.  These values are used in k_getrusage() to actually fill
     ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#533: FILE: kernel/fork.c:892:
+	sig->maxrss = sig->cmaxrss = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#581: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1403:
+		struct mm_struct *mm = get_task_mm(p);
+		if (mm) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
