ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#50: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:194:
+int line_put_char(struct tty_struct *tty, unsigned char ch)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: arch/um/include/line.h:74:
+extern int line_put_char(struct tty_struct *tty, unsigned char ch);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
