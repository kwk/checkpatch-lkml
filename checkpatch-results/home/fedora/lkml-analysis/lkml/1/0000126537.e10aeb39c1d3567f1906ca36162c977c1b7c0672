The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#174: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig.cpu:264:
+config MATOM
+	bool "Intel Atom"
+	---help---

+	  Select this for Intel Atom platform. Intel Atom CPUs have an in-order
+	  pipelining architecture and thus can benefit from in-order optimized
+	  code. Use a recent GCC with specific Intel Atom support in order to
+	  fully benefit from selecting this option.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
