CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#252: FILE: fs/nfs/internal.h:255:
+extern int nfs_commit_unstable_pages(struct address_space *mapping,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct address_space *' should also have an identifier name
#337: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:605:
+	int (*commit_unstable_pages)(struct address_space *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct writeback_control *' should also have an identifier name
#337: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:605:
+	int (*commit_unstable_pages)(struct address_space *,

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#347: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1641:
+#define I_UNSTABLE_PAGES	(1 << __I_UNSTABLE_PAGES)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
