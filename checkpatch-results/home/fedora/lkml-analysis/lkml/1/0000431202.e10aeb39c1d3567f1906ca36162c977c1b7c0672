CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!inode"
#81: FILE: fs/efs/namei.c:89:
+	if (inode == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#86: FILE: fs/efs/namei.c:94:
+^I    ^Iresult = ERR_PTR(-ESTALE);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#86: FILE: fs/efs/namei.c:94:
+^I    ^Iresult = ERR_PTR(-ESTALE);$

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
