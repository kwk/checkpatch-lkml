Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#306: FILE: include/linux/nfsd/nfsfh.h:295:
+extern void fill_post_wcc(struct svc_fh *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
