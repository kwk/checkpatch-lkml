CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ssp)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct socket_smack)...)
#214: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:1229:
+	ssp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct socket_smack), gfp_flags);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
