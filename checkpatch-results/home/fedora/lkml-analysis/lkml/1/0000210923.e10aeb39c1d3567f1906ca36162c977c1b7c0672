CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/io.h:85:
+extern void __iomem *early_ioremap(unsigned long offset, unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#111: FILE: arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c:648:
+static void __init __iomem *__early_ioremap(unsigned long phys_addr, unsigned long size, pgprot_t prot)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
