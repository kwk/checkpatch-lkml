WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#82: FILE: fs/notify/notification.c:326:
+		 * event holder was used, go back and get a new one */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#115: FILE: include/linux/fsnotify_backend.h:368:
+extern int fsnotify_replace_event(struct fsnotify_event_holder *old_holder,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
