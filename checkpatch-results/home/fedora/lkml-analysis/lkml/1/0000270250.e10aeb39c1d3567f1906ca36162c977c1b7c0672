ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#55: FILE: drivers/scsi/Kconfig:268:
+       help $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pdb"
#97: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1049:
+	if (unlikely(pdb == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#106: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1058:
+	BUG_ON(unlikely(count > ivecs));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
