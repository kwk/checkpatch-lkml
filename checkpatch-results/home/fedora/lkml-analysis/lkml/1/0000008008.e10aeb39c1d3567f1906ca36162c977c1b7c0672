WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#53: FILE: drivers/rapidio/Kconfig:12:
+config RAPIDIO_ENABLE_RX_TX_PORTS
+	bool "Enable RapidIO Input/Output Ports"
+	depends on RAPIDIO
+	---help---
+	  The RapidIO specification describes a Output port transmit
+	  enable and a Input port receive enable. The recommended state
+	  for Input ports and Output ports should be disabled. When
+	  this switch is set the RapidIO subsystem will enable all
+	  ports for Input/Output direction to allow other traffic
+	  than Maintenance transfers.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'reciever' may be misspelled - perhaps 'receiver'?
#81: FILE: drivers/rapidio/rio-scan.c:335:
+ * rio_enable_rx_tx_port - enable input reciever and output transmitter of
                                         ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#100: FILE: drivers/rapidio/rio-scan.c:354:
+	/*
+	* enable rx input tx output port

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

+		 "%d, port_num = %d)\n", local, destid, hopcount, port_num);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
