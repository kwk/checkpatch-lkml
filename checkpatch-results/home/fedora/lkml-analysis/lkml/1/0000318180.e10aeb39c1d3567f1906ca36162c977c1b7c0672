WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'occurences' may be misspelled - perhaps 'occurrences'?
#29: 
Replace all relevant occurences of page->index and page->mapping in the NFS
                     ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#86: FILE: fs/nfs/pagelist.c:83:
+	BUG_ON(page_file_mapping(page)->host != inode);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#152: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:147:
+	end = page_offset(page) + ((loff_t)offset+count);
 	                                         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
