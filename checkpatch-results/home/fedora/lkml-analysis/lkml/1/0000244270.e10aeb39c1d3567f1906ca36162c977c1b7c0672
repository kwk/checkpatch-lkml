CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:301:
+extern unsigned long os_get_top_address(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#131: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/sys-i386/task_size.c:107:
+		fprintf(stderr, "Unable to determine bottom of address "
+			"space.\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
