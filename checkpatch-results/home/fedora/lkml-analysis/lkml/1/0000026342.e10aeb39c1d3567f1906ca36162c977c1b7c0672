WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct wacom_features should normally be const
#75: FILE: drivers/input/tablet/wacom_sys.c:711:
+static struct wacom_features wacom_features_0x41 =

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
