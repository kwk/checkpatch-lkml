Subject: [PATCH] i386: During page table initialization always set the leaf page table entries.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#99: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:67:
+		pmd_table = (pmd_t *) alloc_bootmem_low_pages(PAGE_SIZE);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#105: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:73:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
