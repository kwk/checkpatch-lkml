ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while loop
#99: FILE: tools/perf/util/header.c:172:
+#define dsos__for_each_with_build_id(pos, head)	\

+		else

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'pos' - possible side-effects?

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!filename"
#135: FILE: tools/perf/util/header.c:222:
+	if (filename == NULL || linkname == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!linkname"
#135: FILE: tools/perf/util/header.c:222:
+	if (filename == NULL || linkname == NULL)

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#285: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#290: FILE: tools/perf/util/util.c:1:
+#include <sys/mman.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#310: FILE: tools/perf/util/util.c:21:
+	while (*++d == '/');

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
