CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#827: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:41:
+extern int cpu_add_sysdev_attr_group(const struct attribute_group *attrs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#921: FILE: kernel/module.c:1010:
+	sect_attrs->grp.attrs = gattr = (void *)sect_attrs + size[0];

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
