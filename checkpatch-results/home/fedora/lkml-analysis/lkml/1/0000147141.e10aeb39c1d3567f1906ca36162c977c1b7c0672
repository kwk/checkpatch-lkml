#43: 
take the lock for.  This simplifies the -EDEADLK test as if the lock is owned

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#87: FILE: kernel/futex.c:566:
+ * ^I^I"current" except in the case of requeue pi.$

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#107: FILE: kernel/futex.c:586:
+	ret = lock_taken = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
