  1. stable@vger.kernel.org
  2. stable@kernel.org

For adding version info, the following comment style should be used::

  stable@vger.kernel.org # version info

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
