#35: 
This patch adds some comments to the AMD IOMMU initialization code to increase

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#96: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu_init.c:126:
+u16 amd_iommu_last_bdf;			/* largest PCI device id we have

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
