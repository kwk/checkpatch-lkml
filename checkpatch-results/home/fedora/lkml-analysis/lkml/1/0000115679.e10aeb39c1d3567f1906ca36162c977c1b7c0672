ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
