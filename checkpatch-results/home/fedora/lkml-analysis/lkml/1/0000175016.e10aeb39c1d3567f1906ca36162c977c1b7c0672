CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#120: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap2/memory.c:39:
+#define M_LOCK_CTRL	(1 << 2)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#186: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/include/mach/gpmc.h:106:
+extern void __init gpmc_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
