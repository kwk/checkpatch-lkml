ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#75: FILE: security/evm/ima/ima_fs.c:72:
+static void *ima_measurements_next(struct seq_file *m, void *v, loff_t * pos)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
