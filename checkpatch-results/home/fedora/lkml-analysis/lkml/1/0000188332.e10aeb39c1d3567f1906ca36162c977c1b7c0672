WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Constistency' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Consistency'?

+ *  Constistency checked mask.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#158: FILE: net/can/af_can.c:382:
+	if (((*mask & CAN_EFF_RTR_FLAGS) == CAN_EFF_RTR_FLAGS)
+	    && !(*can_id & CAN_RTR_FLAG)) {

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#159: FILE: net/can/af_can.c:383:
+	    && !(*can_id & CAN_RTR_FLAG)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'id' may be better as '(id)' to avoid precedence issues

+		     (CAN_EFF_MASK | CAN_EFF_FLAG | CAN_RTR_FLAG) : \
