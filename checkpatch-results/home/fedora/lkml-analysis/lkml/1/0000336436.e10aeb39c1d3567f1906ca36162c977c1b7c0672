ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#53: FILE: btrfsck.c:712:
+void print_usage(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
