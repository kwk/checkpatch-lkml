CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#66: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_64.c:1160:
+		if (bios_cpu_apicid) {
[...]
+		else if (i < nr_cpu_ids) {
[...]
+		else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#69: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_64.c:1163:
+		}
+		else if (i < nr_cpu_ids) {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#75: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_64.c:1169:
+		}
+		else

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#97: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse_64.c:71:
+u16 x86_bios_cpu_apicid_init[NR_CPUS] __initdata
+				= { [0 ... NR_CPUS-1] = BAD_APICID };

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#97: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse_64.c:71:
+				= { [0 ... NR_CPUS-1] = BAD_APICID };
 				                  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
