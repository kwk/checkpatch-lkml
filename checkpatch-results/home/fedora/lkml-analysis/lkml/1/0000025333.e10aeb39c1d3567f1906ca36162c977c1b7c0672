ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following enum go on the same line
#234: FILE: include/linux/sysfs.h:24:
+enum sysfs_attr_lock_class
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
