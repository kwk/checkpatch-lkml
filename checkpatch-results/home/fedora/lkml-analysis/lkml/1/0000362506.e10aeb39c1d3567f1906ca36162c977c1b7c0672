CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#206: FILE: kernel/sched.c:785:
+	if (set) {
[...]
+	} else hrtick_clear(rq);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#210: FILE: kernel/sched.c:789:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#529: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:259:
+extern void hrtick_resched(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#538: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:844:
+	void (*task_tick) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p, int queued);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
