CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#78: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:133:
+#define MS_MKNOD_NOCAP	(1<<26) /* no capability check in mknod,

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#79: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:134:
+#define MS_MKNOD_NOCAP	(1<<26) /* no capability check in mknod,
+				   implies "nodev" */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'mnt' - possible side-effects?
#87: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:195:
+#define IS_MNT_NODEV(mnt)	(((mnt)->mnt_flags & MNT_NODEV) || \

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#90: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:198:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
