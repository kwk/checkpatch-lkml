Subject: [PATCH 5/5] ide-cd: fix remaining checkpatch.pl issues

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

#83: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:313:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: missing rq in cdrom_decode_status\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
