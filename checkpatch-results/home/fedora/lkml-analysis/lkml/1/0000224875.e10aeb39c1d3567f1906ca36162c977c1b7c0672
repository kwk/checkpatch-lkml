CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#231: FILE: include/asm-x86/page.h:60:
+extern int pagerange_is_ram(unsigned long start, unsigned long end);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <NonWB>
#244: FILE: include/asm-x86/cacheflush.h:28:
+PAGEFLAG(NonWB, non_WB)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
