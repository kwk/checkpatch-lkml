WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#29: 
 .../asm/{mmu_context.h => mmu_context_no.h}        |    2 +

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#64: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/mmu_context.h:1:
+#ifdef CONFIG_MMU

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#88: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/mmu_context_mm.h:14:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/bitops.h> instead of <asm/bitops.h>
#89: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/mmu_context_mm.h:15:
+#include <asm/bitops.h>

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#104: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/mmu_context_mm.h:30:
+/*
+   MicroBlaze has 256 contexts, so we can just rotate through these

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/mmu_context_mm.h:54:
+extern void set_context(mm_context_t context, pgd_t *pgd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#149: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/mmu_context_mm.h:75:
+extern struct mm_struct *context_mm[LAST_CONTEXT+1];
                                                 ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
