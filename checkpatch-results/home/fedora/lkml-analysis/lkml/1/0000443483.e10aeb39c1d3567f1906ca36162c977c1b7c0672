CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:57:
+extern struct page *__page_cache_alloc(gfp_t gfp, int order);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#90: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:72:
+	return __page_cache_alloc(mapping_gfp_mask(x)|__GFP_COLD,
 	                                             ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#122: FILE: mm/filemap.c:807:
+	page = __page_cache_alloc(mapping_gfp_mask(mapping) & ~__GFP_FS,
+		mapping->order);
