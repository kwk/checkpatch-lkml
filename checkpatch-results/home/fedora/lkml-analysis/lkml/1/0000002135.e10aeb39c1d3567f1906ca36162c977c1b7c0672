WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#14: 
Subject: [PATCH] perf tools: Handle sparse CPU numbers correctly

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#192: FILE: tools/perf/util/cpumap.c:1:
+#include "util.h"

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#236: FILE: tools/perf/util/cpumap.c:45:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#260: FILE: tools/perf/util/cpumap.h:4:
+extern int read_cpu_map(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
