CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#48: FILE: drivers/mfd/twl4030-core.c:302:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'twl4030_i2c_write', this function's name, in a string
#49: FILE: drivers/mfd/twl4030-core.c:303:
+		pr_err("%s: twl4030_i2c_write failed to transfer all messages\n", DRIVER_NAME);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
