ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#110: FILE: drivers/mtd/devices/mtd_dataflash.c:541:
+static struct flash_info __devinitdata dataflash_data [] = {

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#111: FILE: drivers/mtd/devices/mtd_dataflash.c:542:
+static struct flash_info __devinitdata dataflash_data [] = {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
