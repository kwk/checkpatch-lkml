Subject: [PATCH 34/42] x86_64: add irq_desc in function in paramater

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#563: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:321:
+extern unsigned int __do_IRQ(unsigned int irq, struct irq_desc *desc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <irq_descX>
#684: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:204:
+		desc = &irq_descX[0];

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#686: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:206:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'irq_desc', this function's name, in a string
#686: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:206:
+			printk("found irq_desc for irq %d\n", desc->irq);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 122 exceeds 100 columns
#688: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:208:
+				printk("found irq_desc for irq %d and next will be irq %d\n", desc->irq, desc->next->irq);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
