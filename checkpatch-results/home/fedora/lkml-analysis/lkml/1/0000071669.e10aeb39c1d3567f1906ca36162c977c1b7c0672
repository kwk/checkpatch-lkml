CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
