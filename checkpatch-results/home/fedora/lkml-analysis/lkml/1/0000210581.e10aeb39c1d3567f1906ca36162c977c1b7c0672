WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#16: 
Subject: [PATCH 36/49] Staging: at76_usb: fix up all remaining checkpatch.pl warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*m)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct mib_mac_encryption)...)
#108: FILE: drivers/staging/at76_usb/at76_usb.c:1067:
+	m = kmalloc(sizeof(struct mib_mac_encryption), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#160: FILE: drivers/staging/at76_usb/at76_usb.c:1744:
+		 * is the frame really ACKed when tx_callback is called ? */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
