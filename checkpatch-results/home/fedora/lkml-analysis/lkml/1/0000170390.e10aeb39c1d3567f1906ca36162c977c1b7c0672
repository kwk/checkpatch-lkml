WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#495: FILE: drivers/acpi/namespace/nsutils.c:323:
+		while (acpi_ns_valid_root_prefix(*next_external_char)) {
+			next_external_char++;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'addr4->sin_addr.s_addr !=

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#2286: FILE: include/linux/if_vlan.h:117:
+extern int vlan_hwaccel_do_receive(struct sk_buff *skb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#2347: FILE: net/8021q/vlan_core.c:29:
+	return (polling ? netif_receive_skb(skb) : netif_rx(skb));

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev"
#2365: FILE: net/8021q/vlan_core.c:41:
+	if (dev == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
