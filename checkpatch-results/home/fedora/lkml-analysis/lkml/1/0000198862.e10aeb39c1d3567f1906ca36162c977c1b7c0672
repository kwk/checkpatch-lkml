WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Duplicate signature
#84: 
Cc: Davide Libenzi <davidel@xmailserver.org>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#172: FILE: fs/select.c:171:
+static int pollwake(wait_queue_t *wait, unsigned mode, int sync, void *key)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#297: FILE: include/linux/poll.h:49:
+	struct file *filp;
 	             ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#319: FILE: include/linux/poll.h:69:
+extern int poll_schedule_timeout(struct poll_wqueues *pwq, int state,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
