#26: 
While trying to get Hyper-V running, I realized that the interrupt injection

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#79: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:2372:
+	BUG_ON(!(svm->vcpu.arch.hflags & HF_GIF_MASK));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#101: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:2410:
+	struct vcpu_svm *svm = to_svm(vcpu);
+	nsvm_printk("Trying to open IRQ window\n");

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+	 * called again though and we'll get the vintr intercept. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
