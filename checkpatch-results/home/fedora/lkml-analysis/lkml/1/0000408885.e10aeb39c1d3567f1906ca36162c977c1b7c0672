#71: 
trigger recovery is a lookup and an iput(), and the normal deallocation
                                    ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#129: FILE: fs/gfs2/inode.c:127:
+		inode->i_mode = mode = DT2IF(type);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#132: FILE: fs/gfs2/inode.c:130:
+			struct gfs2_holder gh;
+			error = gfs2_glock_nq_init(ip->i_gl, LM_ST_EXCLUSIVE, 0, &gh);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'uptodate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'up-to-date'?
#135: FILE: fs/gfs2/inode.c:133:
+			/* Inode is now uptodate */
 			                ^^^^^^^^

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#179: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:55:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
