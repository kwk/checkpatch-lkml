Avoids cache line dirtying : The first cache line of mm_struct is/should_be mostly read.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'begining' may be misspelled - perhaps 'beginning'?
#63: 
In case find_vma() hits the cache, we dont need to access the begining of mm_struct.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#85: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:326:
+	struct vm_area_struct * mmap_cache;	/* last find_vma result */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
