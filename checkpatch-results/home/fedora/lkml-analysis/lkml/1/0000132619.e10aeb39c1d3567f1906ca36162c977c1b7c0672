CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#293: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:522:
+extern const struct pmu *hw_perf_counter_init(struct perf_counter *counter);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#307: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:55:
+extern __weak const struct pmu *hw_perf_counter_init(struct perf_counter *counter)
