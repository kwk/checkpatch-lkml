CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#55: FILE: include/linux/rwsem.h:62:
+extern int rwsem_is_contended(struct rw_semaphore *sem);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
