+ * an optimization (ie. pre-faulting). :*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#253: FILE: include/linux/init.h:142:
+extern int do_one_initcall(initcall_t fn);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
