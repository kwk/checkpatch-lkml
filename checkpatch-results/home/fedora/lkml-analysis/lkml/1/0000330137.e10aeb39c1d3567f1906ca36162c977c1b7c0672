#85: 
Matthew, Greg, Is there a way to extract from messages the usb storage transport

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#129: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/transport.c:465:
+int usb_stor_bulk_srb_length(struct us_data* us, unsigned int pipe,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#159: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/transport.h:142:
+extern int usb_stor_bulk_srb_length(struct us_data* us, unsigned int pipe,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
