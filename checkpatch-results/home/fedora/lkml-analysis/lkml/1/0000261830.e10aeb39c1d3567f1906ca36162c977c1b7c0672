CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pnp_res)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pnp_resource)...)
#1194: FILE: drivers/pnp/resource.c:527:
+	pnp_res = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pnp_resource), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
