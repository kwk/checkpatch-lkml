ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#40: FILE: drivers/staging/winbond/mds.c:28:
+	struct wb35_T01_descriptor *	pT01;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
