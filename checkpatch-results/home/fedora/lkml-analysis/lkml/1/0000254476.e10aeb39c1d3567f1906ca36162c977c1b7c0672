ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"

+static int inia100_build_scb(struct orc_host * host, struct orc_scb * scb, struct scsi_cmnd * cmd)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
