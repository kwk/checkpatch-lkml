WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vaddr"
#51: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:149:
+	if (vaddr == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#83: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:201:
+	user_data = (char __user *) (uintptr_t) args->data_ptr;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#107: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:225:
+		page_base = (offset & ~(PAGE_SIZE-1));
 		                                 ^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#108: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:226:
+		page_offset = offset & (PAGE_SIZE-1);
 		                                 ^

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u64' over 'uint64_t'
#153: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:271:
+	uint64_t data_ptr = args->data_ptr;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!user_pages"
#166: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:284:
+	if (user_pages == NULL)
