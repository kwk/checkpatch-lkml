CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:380:
+extern void __tasklet_hi_schedule_first(struct tasklet_struct *t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#96: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:398:
+	BUG_ON(!irqs_disabled());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#103: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:405:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(__tasklet_hi_schedule_first);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
