Subject: [PATCH] ftrace: add readpos to struct trace_seq; add trace_seq_to_user()

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#129: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2446:
+		sret = iter->trace->read(iter, filp, ubuf, cnt, ppos);
 		                               ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#209: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.h:307:
+extern ssize_t trace_seq_to_user(struct trace_seq *s, char __user *ubuf,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
