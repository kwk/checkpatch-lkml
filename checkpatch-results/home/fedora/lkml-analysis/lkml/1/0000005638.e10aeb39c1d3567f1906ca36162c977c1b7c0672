WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#57: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#206: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv.h:138:
+extern void aer_set_firmware_first(struct pcie_device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#232: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv_acpi.c:61:
+	return	(0           == pci_domain_nr(pci->bus) &&

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#239: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv_acpi.c:68:
+struct aer_hest_parse_info
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#272: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv_acpi.c:101:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
