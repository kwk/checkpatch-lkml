CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: include/asm-generic/iomap.h:66:
+extern void __iomem *pci_ioremap(struct pci_dev *dev, int bar, unsigned long max);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#109: FILE: lib/iomap.c:289:
+ * */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
