CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#152: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.c:234:
+	if (path) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#184: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.h:15:
+extern struct tracepoint_path *tracepoint_id_to_path(u64 config);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#193: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.h:33:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
