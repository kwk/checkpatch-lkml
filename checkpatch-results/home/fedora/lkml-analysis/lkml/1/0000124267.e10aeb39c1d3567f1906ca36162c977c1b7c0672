CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#119: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_stat.c:57:
+	if (node->rb_left)
[...]
+	else if (node->rb_right)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#123: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_stat.c:61:

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around root->rb_node
#162: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_stat.c:99:
+	struct rb_node **new = &(root->rb_node), *parent = NULL;

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
