CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: include/linux/string.h:111:
+extern char **argv_split(gfp_t gfp, const char *str, int *argcp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#75: FILE: lib/argv_split.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#126: FILE: lib/argv_split.c:52:
+	char **p;
+	for (p = argv; *p; p++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

 	                                           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!argv"
#152: FILE: lib/argv_split.c:78:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#197: FILE: lib/argv_split.c:123:
+#define BUG()	abort()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - int main() should probably be int main(void)
#199: FILE: lib/argv_split.c:125:
+int main() {

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#199: FILE: lib/argv_split.c:125:
+int main() {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
