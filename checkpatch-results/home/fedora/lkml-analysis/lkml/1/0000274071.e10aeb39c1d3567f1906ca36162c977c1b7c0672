ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#78: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-sff.c:278:
+^I^I    ^Ireturn status;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#78: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-sff.c:278:
+^I^I    ^Ireturn status;$

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#124: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-sff.c:324:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#221: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:1438:
+extern void ata_sff_pause(struct ata_port *ap);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
