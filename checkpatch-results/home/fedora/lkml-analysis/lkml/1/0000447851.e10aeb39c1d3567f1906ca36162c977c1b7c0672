WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#121: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:313:
+	if (!simple_strtol(buffer, &end, 0))

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
