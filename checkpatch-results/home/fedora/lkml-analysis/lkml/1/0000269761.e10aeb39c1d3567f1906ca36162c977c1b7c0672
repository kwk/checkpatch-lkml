#29: 
there are some users which have interest on such kind of file system like azfs. Please, have a look at this version of a diff file which introduces a first version of azfs to 2.6.26. This file system may be useful for example on IBM CellBlades where user can mount DDR2 memory of Axon controller as a disk and to be able to access it directly without any caching mechanism in between.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRWXUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0777'.
#385: FILE: fs/azfs.c:297:
+	inode = azfs_new_inode(dir->i_sb, dir, S_IFLNK | S_IRWXUGO, 0);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
