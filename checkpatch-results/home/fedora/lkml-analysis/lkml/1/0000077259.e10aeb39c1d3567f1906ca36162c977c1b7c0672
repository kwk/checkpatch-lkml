CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#54: FILE: mm/backing-dev.c:66:
+	nr_wb = nr_dirty = nr_io = nr_more_io = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
