WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#465: FILE: fs/unionfs/lookup.c:44:
+	BUG_ON(!S_ISDIR(hidden_inode->i_mode));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+					sizeof(UNIONFS_DIR_OPAQUE) - 1);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#472: FILE: fs/unionfs/lookup.c:51:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
