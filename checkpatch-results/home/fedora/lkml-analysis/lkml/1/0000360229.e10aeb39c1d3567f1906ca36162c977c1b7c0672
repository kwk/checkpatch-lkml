+config KVM_PV_DMA
+	tristate "Para-virtualized DMA access"
+       ---help---
+         Provides support for DMA operations in the guest. A hypercall
+	 is raised to the host to enable devices owned by guest to use
+	 DMA. Select this if compiling a guest kernel and you need
+	 paravirtualized DMA operations.
+
 # OK, it's a little counter-intuitive to do this, but it puts it neatly under
 # the virtualization menu.
