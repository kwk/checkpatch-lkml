Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: char * array declaration might be better as static const
#133: FILE: fs/fat/inode.c:1257:
+	char *envp[] = { NULL, NULL };

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#146: FILE: fs/fat/inode.c:1275:
+	envp[0] = t_str = kzalloc(ev_len, GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
