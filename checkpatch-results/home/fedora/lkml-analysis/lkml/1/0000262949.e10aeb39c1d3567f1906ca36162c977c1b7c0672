WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#81: FILE: drivers/watchdog/orion5x_wdt.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#82: FILE: drivers/watchdog/orion5x_wdt.c:2:
+ * drivers/watchdog/orion5x_wdt.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#175: FILE: drivers/watchdog/orion5x_wdt.c:95:
+static ssize_t orion5x_wdt_write(struct file *file, const char *data,
+					size_t len, loff_t *ppos)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#202: FILE: drivers/watchdog/orion5x_wdt.c:122:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#230: FILE: drivers/watchdog/orion5x_wdt.c:150:
+		/* Fall through */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_crit([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_crit(dev, ... then pr_crit(...  to printk(KERN_CRIT ...
#257: FILE: drivers/watchdog/orion5x_wdt.c:177:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#258: FILE: drivers/watchdog/orion5x_wdt.c:178:
+		printk(KERN_CRIT "WATCHDOG: Device closed unexpectedly - "
+					"timer will not stop\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
