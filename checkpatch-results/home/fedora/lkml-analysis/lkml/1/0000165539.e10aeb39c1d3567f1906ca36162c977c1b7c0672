WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#119: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic.c:1355:
+		panic("x2apic enabled prior OS handover,"
+				" enable CONFIG_INTR_REMAP");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#216: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/genx2apic_cluster.c:122:
+	if (intr_remapping_enabled) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#223: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/genx2apic_cluster.c:129:
+		if ((unsigned)cpu < nr_cpu_ids)

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#227: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/genx2apic_cluster.c:133:
+	} else

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#263: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/genx2apic_cluster.c:157:
+		return BAD_APICID;
+	} else {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#266: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/genx2apic_cluster.c:160:
+		unsigned long mask2 = cpumask_bits(andmask)[0] & APIC_ALL_CPUS;
+		return mask1 & mask2;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
