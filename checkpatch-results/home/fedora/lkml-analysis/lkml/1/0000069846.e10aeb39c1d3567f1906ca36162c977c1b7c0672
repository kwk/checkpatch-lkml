CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:260:
+extern int runqueue_is_locked(int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#100: FILE: kernel/sched.c:686:
+	return spin_is_locked(&cpu_rq(cpu)->lock);

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
