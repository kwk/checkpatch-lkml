WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'reinitilized' may be misspelled - perhaps 'reinitialized'?
#103: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1042:
+ * reinitilized on resume otherwise the disk
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#161: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1004:
+	void		(*resume)(ide_drive_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
