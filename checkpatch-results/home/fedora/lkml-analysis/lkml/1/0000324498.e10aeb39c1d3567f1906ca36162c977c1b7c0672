CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#165: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:131:
+	is_empty = was_empty = nodes_empty(*nodes);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#202: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:163:
+ ^Ireturn 0;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
