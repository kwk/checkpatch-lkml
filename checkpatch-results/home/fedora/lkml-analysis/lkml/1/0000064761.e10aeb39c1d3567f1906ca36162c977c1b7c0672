WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#62: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig.debug:290:
+config DEBUG_STRICT_USER_COPY_CHECKS
+	bool "Strict copy size checks"
+	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
+	---help---
+	  Enabling this option turns a certain set of sanity checks for user
+	  copy operations into compile time failures.
+
+	  The copy_from_user() etc checks are there to help test if there
+	  are sufficient security checks on the length argument of
+	  the copy operation, by having gcc prove that the argument is
+	  within bounds.
+
+	  If unsure, or if you run an older (pre 4.4) gcc, say N.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
