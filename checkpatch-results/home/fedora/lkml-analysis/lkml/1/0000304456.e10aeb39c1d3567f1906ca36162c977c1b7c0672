Subject: [PATCH 107/148] include/asm-x86/semaphore_32.h: checkpatch cleanups - formatting only

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'name' - possible side-effects?
#42: FILE: include/asm-x86/semaphore_32.h:58:
+#define __DECLARE_SEMAPHORE_GENERIC(name, count)			\
+	struct semaphore name = __SEMAPHORE_INITIALIZER(name, count)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/asm-x86/semaphore_32.h:87:
+extern asmregparm int __down_failed_interruptible(atomic_t *count_ptr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
