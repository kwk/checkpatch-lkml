CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#62: FILE: mm/pagewalk.c:101:
+int walk_page_range(struct mm_struct *mm,
                    unsigned long addr, unsigned long end,

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct mm_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#74: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:749:
+int walk_page_range(struct mm_struct *, unsigned long addr,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
