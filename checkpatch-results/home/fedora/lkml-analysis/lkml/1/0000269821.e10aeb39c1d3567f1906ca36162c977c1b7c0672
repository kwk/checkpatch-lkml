#43: 
we are uing register_e820_active_regions instead of add_active_range directly.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1000:
+extern void shrink_active_range(unsigned int nid, unsigned long new_end_pfn);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#124: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:3632:

 			                                            ^
