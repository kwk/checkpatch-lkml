CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#102: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mtrr.h:119:
+extern void mtrr_add_unaligned(unsigned long base, unsigned long size,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#111: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mtrr.h:151:
 }
+static inline void mtrr_add_unaligned(unsigned long base, unsigned long size,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ot' may be misspelled - perhaps 'to'?
#131: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:495:
+	// round down size to next power ot two
 	                                 ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#135: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:499:
+	ptr1 = ptr2 = (base + size - 1) & ~(size - 1);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
