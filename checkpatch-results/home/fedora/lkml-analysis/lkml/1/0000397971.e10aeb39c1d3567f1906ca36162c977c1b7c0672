WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#41: FILE: drivers/scsi/a4000t.c:38:
 static int __devinit a4000t_probe(struct device *dev)

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#44: FILE: drivers/scsi/a4000t.c:40:
+	struct Scsi_Host *host;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <NCR_700_Host_Parameters>
#54: FILE: drivers/scsi/a4000t.c:50:
+	hostdata = kzalloc(sizeof(struct NCR_700_Host_Parameters), GFP_KERNEL);

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*hostdata)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct NCR_700_Host_Parameters)...)
#54: FILE: drivers/scsi/a4000t.c:50:
+	hostdata = kzalloc(sizeof(struct NCR_700_Host_Parameters), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
