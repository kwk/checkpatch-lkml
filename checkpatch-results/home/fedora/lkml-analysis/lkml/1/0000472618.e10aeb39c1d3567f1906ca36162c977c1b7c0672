WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#37: FILE: drivers/video/pm3fb.c:3303:
+	dev = pci_get_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_3DLABS,
 			    PCI_DEVICE_ID_3DLABS_PERMEDIA3, dev);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#44: FILE: drivers/video/pm3fb.c:3308:
+		dev = pci_get_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_3DLABS,
 				    PCI_DEVICE_ID_3DLABS_PERMEDIA3, dev);

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#52: FILE: drivers/video/pm3fb.c:3354:
+		if (l_fb_info->dev && !disable[i]) {	/* PCI device was found and not disabled by user */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "l_fb_info->dev"
#74: FILE: drivers/video/pm3fb.c:3621:
+			if (l_fb_info->dev != NULL  && !(disable[l_fb_info->board_num])) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#75: FILE: drivers/video/pm3fb.c:3622:
+				if (l_fb_info->vIOBase != (unsigned char *) -1) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <vIOBase>
#75: FILE: drivers/video/pm3fb.c:3622:
+				if (l_fb_info->vIOBase != (unsigned char *) -1) {

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <pIOBase>
#84: FILE: drivers/video/pm3fb.c:3626:
+					release_mem_region(l_fb_info->pIOBase,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#85: FILE: drivers/video/pm3fb.c:3627:
+					release_mem_region(l_fb_info->pIOBase,
