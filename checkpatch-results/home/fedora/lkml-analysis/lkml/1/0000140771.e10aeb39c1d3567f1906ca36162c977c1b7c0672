CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern void filter_print_preds(struct ftrace_event_call *call,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#234: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c:241:
+		preds = kzalloc(MAX_FILTER_PRED * sizeof(pred),
+				GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.
