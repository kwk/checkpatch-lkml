WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#142: FILE: fs/autofs4/waitq.c:363:
+	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&wq->wait_ctr)) {
+		autofs_free_wait_queue(wq);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
