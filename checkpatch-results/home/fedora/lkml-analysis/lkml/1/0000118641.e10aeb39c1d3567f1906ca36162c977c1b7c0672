CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "p"
#130: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-top.c:178:
+	while (*p != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#165: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-top.c:207:
+		if (syme->count[0] != 0) {
[...]
-		}
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#321: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-top.c:349:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
