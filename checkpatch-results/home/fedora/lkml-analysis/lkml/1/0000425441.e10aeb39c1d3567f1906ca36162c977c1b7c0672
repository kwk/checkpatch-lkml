CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p"
#233: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_syscalls.c:144:
+	if (p == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#354: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_syscalls.c:265:
+	if (check_mask & PFM_CMD_STOPPED) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
