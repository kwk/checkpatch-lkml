CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: drivers/base/base.h:78:
+extern void module_add_driver(struct module *mod, struct device_driver *drv);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#80: FILE: drivers/base/module.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#122: FILE: drivers/base/module.c:43:
+	if (mod)
[...]
+	else if (drv->mod_name) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
