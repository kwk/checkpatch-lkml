#44: 
The code beyond this check is intended for either INTERNAL_DEVICE_RESET or CMP_DEVICE_RESET.   If the reason code is something else, we will want to return.  There are 10 other types of reason codes besides these two. This proposed patch means we return only when the reason code is either INTERNAL_DEVICE_RESET or CMP_INTERNAL_RESET.
