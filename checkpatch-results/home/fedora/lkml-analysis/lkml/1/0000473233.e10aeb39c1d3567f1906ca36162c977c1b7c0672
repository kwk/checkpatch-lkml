CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#73: FILE: include/linux/akt.h:160:
+static inline void set_autotuning_routine(struct auto_tune *tunable,
+					auto_tune_fn fn)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "fn"
#75: FILE: include/linux/akt.h:162:
+	if (fn != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#90: FILE: include/linux/akt.h:177:
+	BUG_ON(direction != AKT_UP && direction != AKT_DOWN);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
