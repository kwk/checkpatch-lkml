WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#47: FILE: fs/pramfs/symlink.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#48: FILE: fs/pramfs/symlink.c:2:
+ * FILE NAME fs/pramfs/symlink.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#102: FILE: fs/pramfs/symlink.c:56:
+static void *pram_follow_link(struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)
                                                                        ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#116: FILE: fs/pramfs/symlink.c:70:
+struct inode_operations pram_symlink_inode_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
