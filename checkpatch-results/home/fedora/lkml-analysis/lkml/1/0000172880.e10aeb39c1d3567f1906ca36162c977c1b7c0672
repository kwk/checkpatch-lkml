Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <__ClearPageGUP>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#155: FILE: mm/memory.c:481:
+			if (unlikely(TestSetPageLocked(page)))
[...]
+			else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#286: FILE: mm/memory.c:1673:
+	BUG_ON(!old_page);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
