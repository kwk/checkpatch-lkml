#49: 
sockets (commit bc1d0411) caused a warning for non-NAPI drivers.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/linux/if_vlan.h:117:
+extern int vlan_hwaccel_do_receive(struct sk_buff *skb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#138: FILE: net/8021q/vlan_core.c:29:
+	return (polling ? netif_receive_skb(skb) : netif_rx(skb));

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev"
#156: FILE: net/8021q/vlan_core.c:41:
+	if (dev == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
