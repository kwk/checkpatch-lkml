Subject: [PATCH 2/5] drivers/isdn/act2000: fix sparse warning: symbol shadows

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#56: FILE: drivers/isdn/act2000/act2000_isa.c:261:
+						for (i = 0, p = (__u8 *)&card->idat.isa.rcvhdr, t = tmp; i < 8; i++)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#56: FILE: drivers/isdn/act2000/act2000_isa.c:261:
+						int i; __u8 *p; __u8 *t; __u8 tmp[30];
+						for (i = 0, p = (__u8 *)&card->idat.isa.rcvhdr, t = tmp; i < 8; i++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#56: FILE: drivers/isdn/act2000/act2000_isa.c:261:
+						for (i = 0, p = (__u8 *)&card->idat.isa.rcvhdr, t = tmp; i < 8; i++)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
