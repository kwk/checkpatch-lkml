WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct svc_sock *' should also have an identifier name
#83: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/svcsock.h:69:
+void		svc_close_socket(struct svc_sock *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
