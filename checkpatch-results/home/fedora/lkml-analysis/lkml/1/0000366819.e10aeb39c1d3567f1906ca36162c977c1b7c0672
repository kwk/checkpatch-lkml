Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#244: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/head64.c:22:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
