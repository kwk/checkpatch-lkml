#27: 
In the patch below I propose some changes to the likely/unlikely accounting.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#64: FILE: include/linux/compiler.h:62:
+extern void do_check_likely(struct likeliness *likeliness);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#192: FILE: lib/likely_prof.c:107:
+	seq_printf(out, "|%9u|%9u\t%s()@:%u\n", pos, neg, function,
+					entry->label >> LP_LINE_SHIFT);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#201: FILE: lib/likely_prof.c:116:
+static struct seq_operations likely_profiling_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
