CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#197: FILE: block/blktrace.c:526:
+{

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#200: FILE: block/blktrace.c:529:
+		struct request_queue *q = bdev_get_queue(bdev);
+		if (!q)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#231: FILE: block/ioctl.c:303:
+		return blk_trace_ioctl(bdev, cmd, (char __user *) arg);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
