It doesn't put the CPU into deeper sleep states, so it's better to use the standard

idle loop to save power. But allow to reenable it anyways for benchmarking.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#99: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:277:
+	if (!strcmp(str, "poll")) {

-	} else if (!strncmp(str, "halt", 4)) {

-		pm_idle = default_idle;

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
