CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: fs/nfs/internal.h:201:
+extern void nfs4_restart_rpc(struct rpc_task *, const struct nfs_client *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#67: FILE: fs/nfs/internal.h:205:
+static inline void nfs4_restart_rpc(struct rpc_task *task,
