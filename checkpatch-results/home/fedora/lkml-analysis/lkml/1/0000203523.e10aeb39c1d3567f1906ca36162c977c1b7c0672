WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#44: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#49: FILE: include/linux/debug_print.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_DEBUGPRINT_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: include/linux/debug_print.h:6:
+extern int do_dp_printk(const char *fmt, ...);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#69: FILE: kernel/trace/Kconfig:257:
+config DEBUG_PRINT
+	bool "Trace based printk support"
+	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
+	select TRACING
+	help
+	  This tracer can be used for printk style debugging.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#171: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_debugprint.c:78:
+struct tracer dp_trace __read_mostly =

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
