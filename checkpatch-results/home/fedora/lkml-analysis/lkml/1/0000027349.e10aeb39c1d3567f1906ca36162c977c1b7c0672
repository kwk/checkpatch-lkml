2.6.33-rc1 commit 73848b4684e84a84cfd1555af78d41158f31e16b, adjusted

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: mm/internal.h:113:
+extern void munlock_vma_page(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
