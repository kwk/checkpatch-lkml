ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#84: FILE: kernel/time.c:256:
+unsigned int inline jiffies_to_msecs(const unsigned long j)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.
