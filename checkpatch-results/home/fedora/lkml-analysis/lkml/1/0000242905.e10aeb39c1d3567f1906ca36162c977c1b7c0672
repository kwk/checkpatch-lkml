The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#141: FILE: drivers/video/via/via_i2c.c:96:
+	msgs[0].addr = msgs[1].addr = slave_addr / 2;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
