Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#94: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-stat.c:62:
+static int			verbose				=  0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 161 exceeds 100 columns
#116: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-stat.c:100:
+				printf("Error: counter %d, sys_perf_counter_open() syscall returned with %d (%s)\n", counter, fd[cpu][counter], strerror(errno));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#128: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-stat.c:108:
+		if (fd[0][counter] < 0 && verbose) {
+			printf("Error: counter %d, sys_perf_counter_open() syscall returned with %d (%s)\n", counter, fd[0][counter], strerror(errno));
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
