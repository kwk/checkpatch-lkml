WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#37: FILE: net/bluetooth/l2cap.c:1533:
+static inline int l2cap_config_req(struct l2cap_conn *conn, struct l2cap_cmd_hdr *cmd, u16 cmd_len, u8 *data)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
