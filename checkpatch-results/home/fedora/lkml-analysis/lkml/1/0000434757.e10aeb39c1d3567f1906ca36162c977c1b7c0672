#70: 
 and verified that my user app is woken up in sync with the polling interval.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#245: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/mce.c:342:
+	if (mce_notify_user()) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#364: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/mce.h:108:
+extern int mce_notify_user(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#384: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/thread_info.h:137:
+#define _TIF_MCE_NOTIFY		(1<<TIF_MCE_NOTIFY)

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#384: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/thread_info.h:137:
+#define _TIF_MCE_NOTIFY		(1<<TIF_MCE_NOTIFY)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
