Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: include/linux/lockdep.h:246:
+extern void lock_set_subclass(struct lockdep_map *lock, unsigned int subclass,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#115: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:2296:
+	for (i = depth-1; i >= 0; i--) {
 	              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
