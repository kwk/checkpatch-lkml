ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#61: FILE: src/cyclictest/cyclictest.c:147:
+static int tracing_thresh = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#72: FILE: src/cyclictest/cyclictest.c:388:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#103: FILE: src/cyclictest/cyclictest.c:980:
+		case 1 : tracing_thresh = atoi(optarg); break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
