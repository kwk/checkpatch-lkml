#37: 
These functions can be used as long as we don't need access to global mtd table, but have

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#83: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtdcore.c:469:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#92: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtdcore.c:478:
+	if (mtd->get_device) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#121: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtdcore.c:547:
+	BUG_ON(mtd->usecount < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#148: FILE: include/linux/mtd/mtd.h:293:
+extern int __get_mtd_device(struct mtd_info *mtd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
