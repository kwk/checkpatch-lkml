CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ip->i_itemp"
#141: FILE: fs/xfs/xfs_inode_item.h:173:
+	return (((ip->i_itemp == NULL) ||

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#142: FILE: fs/xfs/xfs_inode_item.h:174:
+	return (((ip->i_itemp == NULL) ||
+		!(ip->i_itemp->ili_format.ilf_fields & XFS_ILOG_ALL)) &&

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#146: FILE: fs/xfs/xfs_inode_item.h:178:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
