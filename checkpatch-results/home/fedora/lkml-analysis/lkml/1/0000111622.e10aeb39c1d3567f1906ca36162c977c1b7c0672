Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: char * array declaration might be better as static const

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
