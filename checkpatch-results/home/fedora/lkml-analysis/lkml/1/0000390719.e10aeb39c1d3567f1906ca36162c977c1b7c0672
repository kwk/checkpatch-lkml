#35: 
The forward declaration of mac_hid_mouse_emulate_buttons() is not visible on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: include/linux/kbd_kern.h:165:
+extern int mac_hid_mouse_emulate_buttons(int, unsigned int, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
