ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#85: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/rtc.c:227:
+	static const char *ids[] __initconst =
+	    { "PNP0b00", "PNP0b01", "PNP0b02", };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
