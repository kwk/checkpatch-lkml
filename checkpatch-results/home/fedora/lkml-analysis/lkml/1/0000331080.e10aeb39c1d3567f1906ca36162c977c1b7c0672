patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Exectuable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Executable'?

       ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#193: FILE: arch/microblaze/Kconfig:134:
+source "arch/microblaze/Kconfig.debug"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
