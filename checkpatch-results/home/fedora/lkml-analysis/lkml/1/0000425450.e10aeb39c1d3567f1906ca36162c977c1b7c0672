+static ssize_t implementation(struct file * file, char __user * buf, size_t count, loff_t * offset)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#76: FILE: drivers/oprofile/oprofile_files.c:127:
+static struct file_operations implementation_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
