Subject: [Patch 2/6] Enhanced partition statistics: update partition statitics
                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#115: FILE: block/blk-merge.c:458:
+		struct hd_struct *part
+			= get_part(req->rq_disk, req->sector);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#170: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:367:
+extern void part_round_stats(struct hd_struct *part);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
