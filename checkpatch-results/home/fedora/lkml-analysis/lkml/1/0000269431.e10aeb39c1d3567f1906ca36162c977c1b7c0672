CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'priv->direct_scan_ssid_len == 0'
#144: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ipw2200.c:6291:
+	if (direct && (priv->direct_scan_ssid_len == 0)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#198: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ipw2200.c:6385:
+		 * ensure that every other scan is a fast channel hop scan */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#221: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ipw2200.c:6424:

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#417: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ipw2200.h:1040:

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
