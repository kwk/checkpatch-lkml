WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#203: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/linux32.c:426:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#930: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43/dma.c:1507:
+		 * The device did not touch the buffer and did not overwrite the poison. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
