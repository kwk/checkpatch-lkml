Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'arch' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#54: FILE: sh/drivers/dma/dma-sh.c:154:
+	if (mach_is_dreamcast() && chan->chan == PVR2_CASCADE_CHAN)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
