CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/hpet.h:69:
+extern int hpet_is_forced_old_ich(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#89: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/hpet.c:756:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "hpet: hpet=force on old ICH enables clockevents,"

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#90: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/hpet.c:757:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "hpet: hpet=force on old ICH enables clockevents,"
+				" but not clocksource.\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - int hpet_is_forced_old_ich() should probably be int hpet_is_forced_old_ich(void)
#104: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c:256:
+int hpet_is_forced_old_ich() {

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#104: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c:256:
+int hpet_is_forced_old_ich() {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
