WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#68: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#73: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/checkpoint_hdr.h:1:
+#ifndef __ASM_S390_CKPT_HDR_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __aligned(8) over __attribute__((aligned(8)))
#90: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/checkpoint_hdr.h:18:
+ * __attribute__((aligned (8))) for the entire structure.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#103: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/checkpoint_hdr.h:31:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
