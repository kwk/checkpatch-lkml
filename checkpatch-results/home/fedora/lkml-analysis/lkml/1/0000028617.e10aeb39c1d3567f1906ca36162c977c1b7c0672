ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#66: FILE: kernel/pm_qos_params.c:108:
+	.requirements =
+		{LIST_HEAD_INIT(system_bus_freq_pm_qos.requirements.list)},

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
