ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#197: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/acer-wmi.c:1151:
platform_device *device)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#221: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/acer-wmi.c:1192:
+static struct dev_pm_ops acer_platform_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
