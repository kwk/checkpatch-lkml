CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#58: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_para.h:27:
+#define KVM_ASYNC_PF_SEND_ALWAYS		(1 << 1)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'resrved' may be misspelled - perhaps 'reserved'?
#86: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:1012:
+	/* Bits 2:5 are resrved, Should be zero */
 	                ^^^^^^^
