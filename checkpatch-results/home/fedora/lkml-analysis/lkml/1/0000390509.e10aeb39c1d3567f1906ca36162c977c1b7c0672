CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#67: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7082:
+	do_each_thread(g, p) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#89: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2082:
+extern void on_each_task(int(*func)(struct task_struct *t, void *d), void *data);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
