Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#212: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:342:
+	 * it during cciss_seq_start. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#238: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:349:
+static struct seq_operations cciss_seq_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#295: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:392:
+	if (strncmp(ENGAGE_SCSI, buffer, sizeof ENGAGE_SCSI - 1) == 0) {
[...]
+			err = -rc;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:SIZEOF_PARENTHESIS: sizeof ENGAGE_SCSI should be sizeof(ENGAGE_SCSI)
#295: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:392:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!proc_cciss"
#333: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:420:
+	if (proc_cciss == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IWUSR | S_IRUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0600'.
#340: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:424:
+	pde = create_proc_entry(hba[i]->devname, S_IWUSR | S_IRUSR |

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#379: FILE: drivers/block/cciss_scsi.c:1418:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
