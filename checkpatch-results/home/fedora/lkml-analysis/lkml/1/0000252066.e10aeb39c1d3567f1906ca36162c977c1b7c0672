#31: 
In ccio-dma.c, I noticed that eventhought the prototype of the function ccio_clear_io_tlb() is:

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#44: 
#define CCIO_IOVP(iova) ((iova) & IOVP_MASK)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#47: 
--- a/drivers/parisc/ccio-dma.c	2008-07-19 21:17:37.000000000 +0000

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
