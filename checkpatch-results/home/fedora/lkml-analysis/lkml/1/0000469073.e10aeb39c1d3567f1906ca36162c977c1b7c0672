ERROR:WEAK_DECLARATION: Using weak declarations can have unintended link defects
#72: FILE: include/linux/time.h:93:
+extern seqlock_t xtime_lock __attribute__((weak));

Using weak declarations like __attribute__((weak)) or __weak
can have unintended link defects.  Avoid using them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/time.h:93:
+extern seqlock_t xtime_lock __attribute__((weak));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
