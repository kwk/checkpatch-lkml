CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#139: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:1702:
+	sbi->s_anchor[0] = sbi->s_anchor[1] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
