WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#1066: FILE: fs/ceph/addr.c:1012:
+static struct vm_operations_struct ceph_vmops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
