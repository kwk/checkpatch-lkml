WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#198: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:446:
+			BUG_ON(p->frag.page_offset > PAGE_SIZE);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

#230: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:523:
+			size_t sw_size, dma_addr_t * phys, void *metadata)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#332: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:1737:
+/**
+*      get_packet - return the next ingress packet buffer from a free list

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#356: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:1761:
+		if (likely(skb != NULL)) {
[...]
+		} else if (!drop_thres)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "skb"
#356: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:1761:
+		if (likely(skb != NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#359: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:1764:
+			    (dma_addr_t)((u64) be32_to_cpu(d->addr_hi) << 32 |
