Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!skb"
#86: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_output.c:2197:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around '&sk->sk_write_queue'
#103: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_output.c:2214:
+			if (skb->next != (struct sk_buff *)(&sk->sk_write_queue))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
