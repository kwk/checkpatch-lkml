WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#22: 
Subject: [patch 49/71] ocfs2: Initialize the cluster were writing to in a non-sparse extend

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#59: FILE: fs/ocfs2/aops.c:897:
+	unsigned	c_needs_zero;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#148: FILE: fs/ocfs2/aops.c:1476:
+			BUG_ON(phys == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
