ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#85: FILE: drivers/bluetooth/hci_vhci.c:317:
struct file *file) static int vhci_fasync(int fd, struct file *file,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#169: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c:2950:
+++ b/drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "substream"
#318: FILE: sound/core/pcm_native.c:3257:
+	snd_assert(substream != NULL, goto out);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
