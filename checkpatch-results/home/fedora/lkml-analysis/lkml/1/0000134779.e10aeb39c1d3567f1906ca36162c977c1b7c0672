description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#68: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/kvm_host.h:38:
+#define KVM_PAGES_PER_HPAGE(x)	(1<<31)
                               	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#131: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c:720:
+^I^I^I          KVM_PAGES_PER_HPAGE(PT_DIRECTORY_LEVEL);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#219: FILE: virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:1003:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#280: FILE: virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:1183:
+		if ((base_gfn+npages) % KVM_PAGES_PER_HPAGE(level))
 		             ^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#281: FILE: virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:1184:
+			new.lpage_info[i][lpages-1].write_count = 1;
 			                        ^
