CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1954:
+extern void __wake_up_parent(struct task_struct *p, struct task_struct *parent);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
