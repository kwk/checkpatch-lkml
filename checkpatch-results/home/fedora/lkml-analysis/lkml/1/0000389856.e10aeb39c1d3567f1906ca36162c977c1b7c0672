WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#59: FILE: include/linux/res_counter.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'opeate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'operate'?

                            ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#168: FILE: init/Kconfig:340:
+config RESOURCE_COUNTERS
+	bool "Resource counters"
+	help
+	  This option enables controller independent resource accounting
+          infrastructure that works with containers
+	depends on CONTAINERS

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#253: FILE: kernel/res_counter.c:61:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#266: FILE: kernel/res_counter.c:74:
+	BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#271: FILE: kernel/res_counter.c:79:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buf"
#292: FILE: kernel/res_counter.c:100:
+	if (buf == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#301: FILE: kernel/res_counter.c:109:
+	tmp = simple_strtoul(buf, &end, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
