When changing a page that has already been modified to non standard attributes

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#78: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr_64.c:247:
+			BUG_ON(page_private(kpte_page) <= 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
