#37: 
New cxgb3i iscsi driver. The driver interfaces with cxgb3 driver to access the hardware.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#92:

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

+	This driver supports iSCSI offload for the Chelsio S3 series devices.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.
