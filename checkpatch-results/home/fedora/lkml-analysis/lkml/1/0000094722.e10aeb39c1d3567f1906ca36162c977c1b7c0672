CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#93: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:14:
+#define DMGL_PARAMS      (1 << 0)       /* Include function args */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro

+#define DMGL_ANSI        (1 << 1)       /* Include const, volatile, etc */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "demangled"
#120: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:627:
+		if (demangled != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
