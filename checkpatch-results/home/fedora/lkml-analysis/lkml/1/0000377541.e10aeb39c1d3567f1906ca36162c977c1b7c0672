#31: 
I've tried to compile 2.6.23-rc6-mm1, but it fails on ipg.c with the error :

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#60: 
#ifdef CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
