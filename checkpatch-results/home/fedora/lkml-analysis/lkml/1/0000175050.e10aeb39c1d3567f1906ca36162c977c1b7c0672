I moved it in /drivers/misc and reorganized virtual files under /sys/class/clock

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#68: FILE: drivers/misc/Kconfig:235:
+config UM_CLOCK
+	bool "User mode clock driver"
+	depends on SYSFS
+	default n
+	---help---
+	Allows user mode programs to configure and control internal clocks'
+	 rates and parents through virtual files in sysfs.
+	This driver requires implementation of some additional functions
+	 in architecture specific low-level drivers: clk_for_each() and
+	 clk_get_name(). Moreover, it requires clk_get() to recognize the
+	 "name.id" format
+	Currently they're implemented only on Samsung S3C24xx platforms.
+
+	If unsure, say N.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#165: FILE: drivers/misc/um_clock.c:66:
+	if (rate != 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_RW: Use DEVICE_ATTR_RW
#226: FILE: drivers/misc/um_clock.c:127:
+}

The DEVICE_ATTR_RW(name) helper macro can be used instead of
DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0644, name_show, name_store);

Note that the macro automatically appends _show and _store to the
named attribute variable of the device for the show and store methods.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#228: FILE: drivers/misc/um_clock.c:129:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(rate, S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR, rate_show, rate_store);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
