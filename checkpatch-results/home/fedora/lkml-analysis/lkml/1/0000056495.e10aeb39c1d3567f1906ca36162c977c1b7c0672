This will pinpoint the responsible function, as long as not several different 

WARNING:PRINTK_RATELIMITED: Prefer printk_ratelimited or pr_<level>_ratelimited to printk_ratelimit
#90: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:340:
+#define printk_ratelimit() ___ratelimit(&printk_ratelimit_state, __func__)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#103: FILE: include/linux/ratelimit.h:28:
+extern int ___ratelimit(struct ratelimit_state *rs, const char *func);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
