CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#130: FILE: fs/ocfs2/namei.c:935:
+	dir->i_ctime = dir->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
#287: FILE: fs/ocfs2/ocfs2_fs.h:121:
+#define OCFS2_BACKUP_SB_START			1 << 30

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#287: FILE: fs/ocfs2/ocfs2_fs.h:121:
+#define OCFS2_BACKUP_SB_START			1 << 30

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#313: FILE: fs/ocfs2/ocfs2_fs.h:596:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
