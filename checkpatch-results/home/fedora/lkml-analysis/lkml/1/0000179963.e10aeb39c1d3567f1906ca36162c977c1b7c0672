CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#170: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init_64.c:595:
+	use_pse = use_gbpages = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
