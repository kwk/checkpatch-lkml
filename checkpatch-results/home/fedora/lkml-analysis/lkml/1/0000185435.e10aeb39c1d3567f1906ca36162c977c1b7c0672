Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#271: FILE: include/linux/swiotlb.h:30:
+extern dma_addr_t swiotlb_phys_to_bus(struct device *hwdev,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#553: FILE: kernel/rcupdate.c:83:
+	struct rcu_synchronize rcu;
+	init_completion(&rcu.completion);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'call_rcu_sched', prefer 'call_rcu' instead
#577: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:1186:
+	call_rcu_sched(&rcu.head, wakeme_after_rcu);

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dir == DMA_FROM_DEVICE'
#1018: FILE: lib/swiotlb.c:489:
+	if (phys && ((dir == DMA_FROM_DEVICE) || (dir == DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dir == DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL'
