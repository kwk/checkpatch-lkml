WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'intialization' may be misspelled - perhaps 'initialization'?
#65: 
After intialization, usemap is used for only pfn in valid range.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'z->zone_start_pfn < pfn'
#100: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2550:
+		if ((z->zone_start_pfn < pfn)
+		    && (pfn < z->zone_start_pfn + z->spanned_pages)
+		    && !(pfn & (pageblock_nr_pages-1)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
