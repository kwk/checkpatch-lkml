CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u16' over 'uint16_t'

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!node"
#81: FILE: drivers/gpio/pca953x.c:217:
+	if (node == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pdata)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pca953x_platform_data)...)
#84: FILE: drivers/gpio/pca953x.c:220:
+	pdata = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pca953x_platform_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#101: FILE: drivers/gpio/pca953x.c:237:
+	if (val) {
+		pdata->invert = *val;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
