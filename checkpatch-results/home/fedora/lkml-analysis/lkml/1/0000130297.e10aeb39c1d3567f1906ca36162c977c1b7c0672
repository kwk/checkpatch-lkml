Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#130: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:811:
 		if ((unsigned long)buf & alignment
+		    || blk_rq_bytes(rq) & q->dma_pad_mask

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#163: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:230:
+	pc->req_xfer = pc->buf_size = blk_rq_bytes(rq);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
