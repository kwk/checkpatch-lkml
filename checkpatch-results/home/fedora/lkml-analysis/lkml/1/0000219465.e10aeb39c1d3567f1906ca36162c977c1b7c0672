CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#90: FILE: mm/slob.c:517:
+	if (slob_page(sp)) {
[...]

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#93: FILE: mm/slob.c:520:
+		unsigned int *m = (unsigned int *)(block - align);
+		return SLOB_UNITS(*m) * SLOB_UNIT;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
