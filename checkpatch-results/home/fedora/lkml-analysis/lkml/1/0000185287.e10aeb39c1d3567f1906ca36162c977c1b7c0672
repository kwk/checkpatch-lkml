patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#150: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/swab.h:1:
+#ifndef _ASM_POWERPC_SWAB_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:ARCH_DEFINES: architecture specific defines should be avoided
#165: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/swab.h:16:
+#ifndef __powerpc64__

Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever
possible.
