Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "filter"
#81: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:503:
+	if (filter != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#170: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.h:26:
+extern int parse_filter(const struct option *opt, const char *str, int unset);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
