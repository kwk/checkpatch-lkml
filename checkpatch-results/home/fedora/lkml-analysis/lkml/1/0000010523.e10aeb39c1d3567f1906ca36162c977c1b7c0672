#25: 
Some cleanup before the header file split-out so we don't propagate this style

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Header>
#52: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:1350:
+			c->Header.ReplyQueue = 0;   /* unused in simple mode */

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <ReplyQueue>
#52: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:1350:
+			c->Header.ReplyQueue = 0;   /* unused in simple mode */

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#58: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:1355:
+			} else /* no buffers to fill */

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#213: FILE: drivers/block/cciss_cmd.h:8:
+#define SENSEINFOBYTES          32 /* note that this value may vary

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
