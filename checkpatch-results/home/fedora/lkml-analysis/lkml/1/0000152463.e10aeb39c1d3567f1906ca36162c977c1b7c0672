#67: FILE: fs/notify/inode_mark.c:233:
+int fsnotify_add_mark(struct fsnotify_mark_entry *entry, struct fsnotify_group *group, struct inode *in_inode)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
