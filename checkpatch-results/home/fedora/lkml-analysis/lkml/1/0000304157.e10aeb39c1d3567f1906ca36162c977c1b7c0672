CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:32:
+extern void mem_cgroup_fork_init(struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#107: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:76:
+extern struct mem_cgroup *mem_cgroup_from_task(struct task_struct *p);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#159: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:258:
+	struct mem_cgroup *mem, *oldmem;
+	if (!mm)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#194: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:507:
+	BUG_ON(!mem_cont);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
