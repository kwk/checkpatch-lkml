ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#86: FILE: refclock_nmea.c:258:
+		return (0);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#88: FILE: refclock_nmea.c:260:
+	msyslog(LOG_INFO, "refclock_nmea: found PPS source \"%s\" at id #%d on \"%s\"", path, fd, id);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
