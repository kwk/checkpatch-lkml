#41: 
Subject: [PATCH] ide: replace the global ide_lock spinlock by per-hwgroup spinlocks

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#536: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/umc8672.c:111:
+	ide_hwgroup_t *mate_hwgroup = hwif->mate ? hwif->mate->hwgroup : NULL;
+	unsigned long uninitialized_var(flags);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#536: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/umc8672.c:111:
+	unsigned long uninitialized_var(flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'flags' should also have an identifier name
#536: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/umc8672.c:111:
+	unsigned long uninitialized_var(flags);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#579: FILE: drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c:609:
+	/* First give it some more time, how much is "right" is hard to say :-(
+	   FIXME - uses mdelay which causes latency? */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pc"
#621: FILE: drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c:682:
+	if (pc == NULL || req != hwgroup->rq || hwgroup->handler == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hwgroup->handler"
#621: FILE: drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c:682:
