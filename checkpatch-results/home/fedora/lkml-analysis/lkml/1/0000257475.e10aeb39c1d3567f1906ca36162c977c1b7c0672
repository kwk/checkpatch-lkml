>>>> Subject: [PATCH 1/1] x86: Add check for node passed to node_to_cpumask V3

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#123: FILE: include/asm-x86/topology.h:85:
+extern const cpumask_t *_node_to_cpumask_ptr(int node);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
