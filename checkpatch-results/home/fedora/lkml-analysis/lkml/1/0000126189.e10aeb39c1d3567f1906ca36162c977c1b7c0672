WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#327: FILE: kernel/posix-cpu-timers.c:1081:
+		if (!cputime_eq(it->expires, cputime_zero)) {
+			it->expires = cputime_add(it->expires, cur_time);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
