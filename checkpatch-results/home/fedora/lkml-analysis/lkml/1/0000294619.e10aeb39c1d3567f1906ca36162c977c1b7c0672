This patch removes lock_kernel(), unlock_kernel() usage in fbmem.c and replaces it with a mutex

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#62: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:991:
+__fb_ioctl(struct inode *inode, struct file *file, unsigned int cmd,
 	 unsigned long arg)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
