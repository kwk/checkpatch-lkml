CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: include/asm-x86/acpi.h:161:
+extern void acpi_fake_nodes(const struct bootnode *fake_nodes,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#50: FILE: include/asm-x86/acpi.h:162:
+extern void acpi_fake_nodes(const struct bootnode *fake_nodes,
 				   int num_nodes);
