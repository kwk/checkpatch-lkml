CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ti"
#63: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c:1065:
+	if (unlikely(ti == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#80: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c:1082:
+	BUG_ON(thread_info_cache == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
