WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 123 exceeds 100 columns
#50: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_qdi.c:378:
+					if (qdi_init_one(port, 6580, ide_port[r & 0x01], ide_irq[r & 0x01], r & 0x04) == 0)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
