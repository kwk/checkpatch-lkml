Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ocfs2_abort_trigger', this function's name, in a string
#109: FILE: fs/ocfs2/journal.c:422:
+	     "ocfs2_abort_trigger called by JBD2.  bh = 0x%lx, "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#110: FILE: fs/ocfs2/journal.c:423:
+	     "ocfs2_abort_trigger called by JBD2.  bh = 0x%lx, "
+	     "bh->b_blocknr = %llu\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#115: FILE: fs/ocfs2/journal.c:428:
+	 * don't, it'll just crash. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
