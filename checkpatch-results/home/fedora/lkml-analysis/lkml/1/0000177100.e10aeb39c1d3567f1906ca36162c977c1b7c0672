WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#81: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-gru/grukservices.c:706:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-gru/grutables.h:603:
+extern void gru_kservices_exit(struct gru_state *gru);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
