ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#124: FILE: async_tx/async_memcpy.c:55:
unsigned int dest_offset,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#138: FILE: async_tx/async_memcpy.c:80:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
