WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#79: FILE: arch/powerpc/Kconfig:251:
+config HIGHPTE
+	bool "Put PTE pages in high memory"
+	default n
+	depends on HIGHMEM && 6xx && EXPERIMENTAL
+	---help---
+	  The VM uses one page table entry for each page of physical memory.
+	  For 32-bit systems with a lot of RAM, this can be wasteful of
+	  precious low memory.  Setting this option will put user-space page
+	  table entries in high memory.
+
+	  This option is highly experimental.  Do not enable unless you are
+	  testing the VM.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
