#33: 
Signed-Off-By: Bodo Eggert <7eggert@gmx.de>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#44: FILE: fs/pipe.c:868:
+	 * Off cause this will not work for 32 bit inodes on 64 bit systems. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#45: FILE: fs/pipe.c:869:
+	if (sizeof(inode->i_ino) >= sizeof(struct inode*))

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#46: FILE: fs/pipe.c:870:
+		inode->i_ino = (unsigned int) inode;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
