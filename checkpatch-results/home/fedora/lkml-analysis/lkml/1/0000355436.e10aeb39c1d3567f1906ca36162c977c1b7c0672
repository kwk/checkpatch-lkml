ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#117: FILE: arch/x86_64/lib/delay.c:39:
+	while ((now-bclock) < loops);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:WHILE_AFTER_BRACE: while should follow close brace '}'
#117: FILE: arch/x86_64/lib/delay.c:39:
 	}
+	while ((now-bclock) < loops);

while should follow the closing bracket on the same line::

  do {
          ...
  } while(something);
