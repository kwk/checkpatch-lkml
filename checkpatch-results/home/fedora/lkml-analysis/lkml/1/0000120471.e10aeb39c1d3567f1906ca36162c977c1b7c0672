WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#667: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-top.c:645:
+			fd[i][counter] = sys_perf_counter_open(&hw_event, target_pid, cpu, group_fd, 0);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
