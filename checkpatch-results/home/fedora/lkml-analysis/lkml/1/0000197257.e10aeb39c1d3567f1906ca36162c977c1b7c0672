WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#233: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c:958:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(sdhci_set_clock);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#256: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.h:287:
+extern void sdhci_change_clock(struct sdhci_host *host, unsigned int clock);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
