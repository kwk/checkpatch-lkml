WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#41: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma_64.c:50:
+dma_alloc_pages(struct device *dev, gfp_t gfp, unsigned size,

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#86: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma_64.c:112:
+		if (force_iommu)
[...]
 		else if (high) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#148: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma_64.c:175:
+	   The caller just has to use *_mask allocations in this case. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
