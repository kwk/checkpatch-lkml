CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*db)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct debug_buffer)...)
#140: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlm/dlmdebug.c:316:
+	db = kzalloc(sizeof(struct debug_buffer), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#348: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlm/dlmdebug.c:524:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0400'.
#363: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlm/dlmdebug.c:539:
+						     S_IFREG|S_IRUSR,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
