WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#54: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#59: FILE: drivers/pci/irq.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:PREFER_DEV_LEVEL: Prefer dev_err(... to dev_printk(KERN_ERR, ...

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#85: FILE: drivers/pci/irq.c:27:
+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#110: FILE: drivers/pci/irq.c:52:
+		pci_note_irq_problem(pdev, "Potential ACPI misrouting please reboot with acpi=noirq");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#133: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:548:
+};
+enum pci_lost_interrupt_reason pci_lost_interrupt(struct pci_dev *dev);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
