CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

+	bootmap_size = bootmem_bootmap_pages(end_pfn)<<PAGE_SHIFT;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#108: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init_64.c:632:
+	bootmap = find_e820_area(0, end_pfn<<PAGE_SHIFT, bootmap_size,
 	                                   ^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#115: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init_64.c:639:
+	early_res_to_bootmem(0, end_pfn<<PAGE_SHIFT);
 	                               ^

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#155: FILE: include/asm-x86/page_64.h:86:
+extern void initmem_init(unsigned long start_pfn, unsigned long end_pfn);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
