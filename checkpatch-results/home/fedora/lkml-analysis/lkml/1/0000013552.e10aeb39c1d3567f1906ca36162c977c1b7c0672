ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#88: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:89:
opening. Default is 1/2 second */

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#89: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:90:
+#define CONF_PRE_OPEN		CONFIG_NETDEVICES_DELAY_PRE_OPEN	/* Before
+#define CONF_POST_OPEN		CONFIG_NETDEVICES_DELAY_POST_OPEN	/* After

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
