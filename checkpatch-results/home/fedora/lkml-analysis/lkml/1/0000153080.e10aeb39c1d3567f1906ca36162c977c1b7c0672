WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#178: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apm_32.c:580:
+	BUG_ON(cpu != 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#205: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apm_32.c:604:
+	 * have to worry about OOM or overhead. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#353: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apm_32.c:750:
+	call.ebx = call.ecx = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'apm_do_idle', this function's name, in a string
#403: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apm_32.c:842:
+			printk(KERN_DEBUG "apm_do_idle failed (%d)\n", err);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
