WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments

#ifdef CONFIG_INTR_REMAP section of the code.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Duplicate signature

specified by the community.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#120: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic/io_apic.c:2636:
+	for (;;) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
