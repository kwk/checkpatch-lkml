WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'unitialized' may be misspelled - perhaps 'uninitialized'?
#32: 
If uart is unitialized, we return before its use.
           ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#48: FILE: sound/drivers/serial-u16550.c:902:
 static int __devinit snd_serial_probe(struct platform_device *devptr)

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'uart' should also have an identifier name
#52: FILE: sound/drivers/serial-u16550.c:905:
+	struct snd_uart16550 *uninitialized_var(uart);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
