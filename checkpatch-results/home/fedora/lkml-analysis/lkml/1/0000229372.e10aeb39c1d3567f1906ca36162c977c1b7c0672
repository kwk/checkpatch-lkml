WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+	  If you say Y here, you will be able to classify packets based on
+	  cgroup membership of the task originating the packet.

+	  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called cls_cgroup.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#97: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#102: FILE: net/sched/cls_cgroup.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#103: FILE: net/sched/cls_cgroup.c:2:
+ * net/sched/cls_cgroup.c	Simple packet classifier which can filter

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#104: FILE: net/sched/cls_cgroup.c:3:

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#150: FILE: net/sched/cls_cgroup.c:49:

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#159: FILE: net/sched/cls_cgroup.c:58:
+	list_for_each_entry(f, &head->flist, link) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#178: FILE: net/sched/cls_cgroup.c:77:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!head"
#181: FILE: net/sched/cls_cgroup.c:80:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

#200: FILE: net/sched/cls_cgroup.c:99:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
