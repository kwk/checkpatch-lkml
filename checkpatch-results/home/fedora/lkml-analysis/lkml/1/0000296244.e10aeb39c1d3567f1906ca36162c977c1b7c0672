CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#157: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:963:
+extern int fcntl_getpath(struct path *fpath, char __user *path, int maxsize);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
