WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#159: FILE: drivers/pci/msi.c:69:
+		int i, nvec;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#304: FILE: drivers/pci/msi.c:642:
+			BUG_ON(irq_has_action(entry->irq + i));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#357: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:827:
+extern int pci_enable_msi_block(struct pci_dev *dev, unsigned int nvec);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
