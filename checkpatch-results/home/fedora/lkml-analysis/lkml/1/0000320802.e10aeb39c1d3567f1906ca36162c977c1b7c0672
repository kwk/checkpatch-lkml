Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
