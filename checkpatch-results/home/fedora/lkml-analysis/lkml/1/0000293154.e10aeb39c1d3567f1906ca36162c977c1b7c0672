ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#124: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:330:
+	bufname = (unsigned char*)__get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
