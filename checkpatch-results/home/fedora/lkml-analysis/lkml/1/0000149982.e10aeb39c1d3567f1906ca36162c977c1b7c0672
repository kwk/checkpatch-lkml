CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#151: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:75:
+extern int kobject_set_name_vargs(struct kobject *kobj, const char *fmt,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#166: FILE: lib/kobject.c:216:
+int kobject_set_name_vargs(struct kobject *kobj, const char *fmt,
 				  va_list vargs)
