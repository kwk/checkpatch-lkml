WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#61: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:266:
+         Please update rlim_names in fs/proc/array.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#61: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:266:
+         Please update rlim_names in fs/proc/array.c$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#61: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:266:
+         Please update rlim_names in fs/proc/array.c$

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#61: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:266:
+         Please update rlim_names in fs/proc/array.c
                                        ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
