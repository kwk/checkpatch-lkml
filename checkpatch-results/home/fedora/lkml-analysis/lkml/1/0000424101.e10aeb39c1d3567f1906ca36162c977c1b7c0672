WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#173: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:479:
+		 * become disabled. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#295: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:643:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#397: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:776:
+	if (hotkeys_over_input && hotkeys_check_per_sec > 0) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
