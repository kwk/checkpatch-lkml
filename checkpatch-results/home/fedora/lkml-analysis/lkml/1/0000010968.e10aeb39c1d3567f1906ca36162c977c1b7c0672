WARNING:BAD_STABLE_ADDRESS_STYLE: Invalid email format for stable: 'stable <stable@kernel.org>', prefer 'stable@kernel.org'
#36: 
Cc: stable <stable@kernel.org>

The email format for stable is incorrect.
Some valid options for stable address are::

  1. stable@vger.kernel.org
  2. stable@kernel.org

For adding version info, the following comment style should be used::

  stable@vger.kernel.org # version info

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#84: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:100:
+		umode_t mode = iattr->ia_mode;
+		iattrs->ia_mode = sd->s_mode = mode;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#84: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:100:
+		iattrs->ia_mode = sd->s_mode = mode;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
