CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#79: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:192:
+	ec->curr->irq_count = ec->curr->wi = ec->curr->ri = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#98: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:206:
+			acpi_ec_write_data(ec,
+				ec->curr->wdata[ec->curr->wi++]);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#127: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:238:
+		if (wait_event_timeout(ec->wait, ec_transaction_done(ec),
+					msecs_to_jiffies(ACPI_EC_DELAY)))
