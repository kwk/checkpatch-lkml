Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#47:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#77: FILE: fs/eventpoll.c:2:
+ *  fs/eventpoll.c (Efficient event retrieval implementation)

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#263: FILE: fs/eventpoll.c:393:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#369: FILE: fs/eventpoll.c:519:

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#408: FILE: fs/eventpoll.c:641:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
