#30: 
Today kvm_io_bus_regsiter_dev() returns void and will internally BUG_ON if it

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#136: FILE: include/linux/kvm_host.h:67:
+void kvm_io_bus_unregister_dev(struct kvm_io_bus *bus,
+			    struct kvm_io_device *dev);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#206: FILE: virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:2487:
+	if (bus->dev_count > (NR_IOBUS_DEVS-1))
 	                                   ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#221: FILE: virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:2502:
+	for (i = 0; i < bus->dev_count; i++) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
