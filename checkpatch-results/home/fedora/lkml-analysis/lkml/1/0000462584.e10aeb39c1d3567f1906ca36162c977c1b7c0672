CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#40: FILE: include/linux/rwsem.h:85:
+extern int down_read_trylock_non_owner(struct rw_semaphore *sem);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#63: FILE: kernel/rwsem.c:133:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(down_read_trylock_non_owner);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
