CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: include/linux/ftrace.h:227:
+extern int trace_vbprintk(unsigned long ip, const char *fmt, va_list args);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#90: FILE: kernel/trace/Kconfig:100:
+config TRACE_BPRINTK
+	bool "Binary printk for tracing"
+	default y
+	depends on TRACING
+	select BINARY_PRINTF
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#200: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.h:134:
+};
+#ifdef CONFIG_TRACE_BPRINTK

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#216: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#221: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_bprintk.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#294: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_bprintk.c:74:
+static struct tracer bprintk_trace __read_mostly =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
