ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#123: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-sff.c:278:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#175: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-sff.c:330:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

#180: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-sff.c:335:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
