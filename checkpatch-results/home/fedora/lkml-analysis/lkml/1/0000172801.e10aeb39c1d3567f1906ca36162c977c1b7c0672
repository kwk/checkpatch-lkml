ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#101: FILE: include/linux/if_vlan.h:113:
*dev);

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#106: FILE: include/linux/if_vlan.h:117:
+extern int vlan_hwaccel_do_receive(struct sk_buff *skb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#160: FILE: net/8021q/vlan_core.c:29:
+	return (polling ? netif_receive_skb(skb) : netif_rx(skb));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#160: FILE: net/8021q/vlan_core.c:29:
+	return (polling ? netif_receive_skb(skb) : netif_rx(skb));

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev"
#178: FILE: net/8021q/vlan_core.c:41:
+	if (dev == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
