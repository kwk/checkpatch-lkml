ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#93: FILE: drivers/w1/w1.h:143:
=20

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct w1_master *' should also have an identifier name
#117: FILE: drivers/w1/w1.h:213:
+void w1_next_pullup(struct w1_master *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#117: FILE: drivers/w1/w1.h:213:
+void w1_next_pullup(struct w1_master *, int);

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'hardare' may be misspelled - perhaps 'hardware'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#137: FILE: drivers/w1/w1_int.c:118:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'w1_add_master_device', this function's name, in a string
#137: FILE: drivers/w1/w1_int.c:118:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "w1_add_master_device: set_pullup requires "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#138: FILE: drivers/w1/w1_int.c:119:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "w1_add_master_device: set_pullup requires "
+			"write_byte or touch_bit, disabling\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
