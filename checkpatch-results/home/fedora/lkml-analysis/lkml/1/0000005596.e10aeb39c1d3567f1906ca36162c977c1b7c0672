WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#155: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-omap3touchbook.c:526:
+	return strict_strtoul(p, 10, &touchbook_revision);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
