Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0

+int nobootirqquirk __read_mostly = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
