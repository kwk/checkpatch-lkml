Subject: l2tp: Fix possible oops if transmitting or receiving when tunnel goes down

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!session"
#73: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:245:
+	if (session == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tunnel"
#92: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:264:
+	if (tunnel == NULL) {

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#258: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:1277:
+		BUG_ON(session->magic != L2TP_SESSION_MAGIC);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
