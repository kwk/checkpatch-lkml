CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#59: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/io_common.c:40:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#134: FILE: include/asm-ia64/sn/acpi.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#149: FILE: include/asm-ia64/sn/acpi.h:16:
+extern int sn_acpi_base_support(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
