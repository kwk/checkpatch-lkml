#35: 
* Don't do a get_mtd_device in blktrans_open because it would lead to a deadlock

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#188: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtd_blkdevs.c:178:
+	/* Take another reference on the device so it won't go away till
+		last release */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
