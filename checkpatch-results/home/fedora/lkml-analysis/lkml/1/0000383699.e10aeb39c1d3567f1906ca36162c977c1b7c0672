WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#227: FILE: kernel/res_counter.c:116:
+		if (write_strategy(buf, &tmp)) {
+			goto out_free;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoull is obsolete, use kstrtoull instead
#231: FILE: kernel/res_counter.c:120:
+		tmp = simple_strtoull(buf, &end, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
