CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#101: FILE: mm/hugetlb.c:503:
+	max_huge_pages[h - hstates] = h->free_huge_pages = h->nr_huge_pages = i;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#112: FILE: mm/hugetlb.c:535:
+	unsigned long *mhp = &max_huge_pages[parsed_hstate - hstates];
+	if (sscanf(s, "%lu", mhp) <= 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
