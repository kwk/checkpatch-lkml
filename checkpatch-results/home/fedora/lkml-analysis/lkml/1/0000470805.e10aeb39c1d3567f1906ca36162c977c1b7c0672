ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#27: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/paravirt.c	Fri Feb 02 13:54:53 2007 -0800

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#174: FILE: include/asm-i386/vmi_time.h:52:
+extern unsigned long long vmi_get_sched_cycles(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
