CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#66: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tsc_sync.c:49:
+	start = last_tsc = get_cycles_sync();

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
