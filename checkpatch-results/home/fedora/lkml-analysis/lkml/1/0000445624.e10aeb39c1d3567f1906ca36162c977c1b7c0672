CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#84: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1054:
+extern int cmdline_parse_kernelcore(char *p, char **retp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
