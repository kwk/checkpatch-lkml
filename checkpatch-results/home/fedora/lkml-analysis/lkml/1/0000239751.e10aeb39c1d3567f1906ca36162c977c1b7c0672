CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#56: FILE: include/linux/pid.h:170:
+		do {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while loop
#57: FILE: include/linux/pid.h:171:
+#define while_each_pid_thread(pid, type, task)				\
+		} while_each_thread(tg___, task);			\
+		task = tg___;						\
+	} while_each_pid_task(pid, type, task)

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)
