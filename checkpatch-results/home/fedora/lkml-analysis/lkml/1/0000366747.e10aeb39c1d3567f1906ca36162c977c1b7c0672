CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#136: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:1354:
+			else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#195: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_mrmw.c:1870:
+				pgaddr = ( page_to_pfn(sg_page(&chunk->page_list[i]))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#241: FILE: drivers/pci/intel-iommu.c:2013:
+		BUG_ON(!sg_page(sg));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*send_els->req)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct scatterlist)...)
#288: FILE: drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_erp.c:311:
+	send_els->req = kmalloc(sizeof(struct scatterlist), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*send_els->resp)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct scatterlist)...)
#294: FILE: drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_erp.c:316:
+	send_els->resp = kmalloc(sizeof(struct scatterlist), GFP_ATOMIC);
