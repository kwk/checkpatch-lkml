WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#58: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#63: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/fakephp.c:1:
+/* Works like the fakephp driver used to, except a little better.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#97: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/fakephp.c:35:
+	struct legacy_slot *slot = container_of(kobj, typeof(*slot), kobj);
+	strcpy(buf, "1\n");

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#112: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/fakephp.c:50:
+	if (strict_strtoul(buf, 0, &val) < 0)

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#137: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/fakephp.c:75:
+	.sysfs_ops = &(struct sysfs_ops){

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
