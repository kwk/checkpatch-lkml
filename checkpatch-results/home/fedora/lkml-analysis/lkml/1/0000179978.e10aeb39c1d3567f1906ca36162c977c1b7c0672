CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#92: FILE: drivers/net/e1000e/e1000.h:336:
+#define FLAG2_CRC_STRIPPING               (1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
