#72: FILE: include/linux/cpu_acct.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#80: FILE: include/linux/cpu_acct.h:9:
+extern void cpuacct_charge(struct task_struct *, cputime_t cputime);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#82: FILE: include/linux/cpu_acct.h:11:
+static void inline cpuacct_charge(struct task_struct *p, cputime_t cputime) {}

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#93: FILE: init/Kconfig:321:

+	bool "Simple CPU accounting cgroup subsystem"
+	depends on CGROUPS
+	help
+	  Provides a simple Resource Controller for monitoring the
+	  total CPU consumed by the tasks in a cgroup
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#119: FILE: kernel/cpu_acct.c:2:
+ * kernel/cpu_acct.c - CPU accounting cgroup subsystem

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#175: FILE: kernel/cpu_acct.c:58:
+	 * current time */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#278: FILE: kernel/cpu_acct.c:161:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
