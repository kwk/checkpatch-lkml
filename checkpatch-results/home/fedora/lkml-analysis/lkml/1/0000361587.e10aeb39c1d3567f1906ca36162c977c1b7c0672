The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#50: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:471:

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#79: FILE: fs/unionfs/subr.c:65:
+				int ret = PTR_ERR(lower_dentry);
+				if (!IS_COPYUP_ERR(ret))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
