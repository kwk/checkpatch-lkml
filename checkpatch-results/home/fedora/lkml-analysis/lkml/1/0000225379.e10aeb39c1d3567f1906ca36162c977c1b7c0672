CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/kvm_ppc.h:67:
+extern void kvmppc_mmu_switch_pid(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, u32 pid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#131: FILE: arch/powerpc/kvm/44x_tlb.c:227:
+ * switching address spaces. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
