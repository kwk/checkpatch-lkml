CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#277: FILE: include/linux/reboot.h:73:
+extern int orderly_poweroff(bool force);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: char * array declaration might be better as static const
#308: FILE: kernel/sys.c:2299:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!argv"
#316: FILE: kernel/sys.c:2307:
+	if (argv == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#338: FILE: kernel/sys.c:2329:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
