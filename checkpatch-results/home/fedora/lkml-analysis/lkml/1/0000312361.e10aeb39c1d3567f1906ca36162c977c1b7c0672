CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/nmi.h> instead of <asm/nmi.h>
#86: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:7:
+#include <asm/nmi.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#157: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:250:

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#168: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:261:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#174: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:267:
+	BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#351: FILE: include/asm-x86/smp.h:73:
+extern int __cpu_disable(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
