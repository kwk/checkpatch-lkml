ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#37: 
--- a/fs/ext2/ext2.h	Mon Jul 09 10:53:57 2007 -0400

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#93: FILE: fs/ext2/inode.c:652:
+	if (em) {
+		return em;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#143: FILE: fs/ext2/inode.c:702:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
