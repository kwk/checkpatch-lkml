WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#57: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:33:
+			/* Catch corrupt table ends before we walk into

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dmi_save_ipmi_device', this function's name, in a string
#123: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:280:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "dmi_save_ipmi_device: table overrun.\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
