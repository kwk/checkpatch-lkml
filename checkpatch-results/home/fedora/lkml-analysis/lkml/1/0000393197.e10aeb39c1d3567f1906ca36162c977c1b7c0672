WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct net_device *' should also have an identifier name
#91: FILE: include/linux/ethtool.h:389:
+	u32     (*get_flags)(struct net_device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct net_device *' should also have an identifier name
#92: FILE: include/linux/ethtool.h:390:

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'u32' should also have an identifier name

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
