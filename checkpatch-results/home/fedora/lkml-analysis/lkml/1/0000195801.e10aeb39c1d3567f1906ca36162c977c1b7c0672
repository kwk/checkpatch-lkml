Subject: [RFC][PATCH 3/4] memcg: hierachical reclaim
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cgrp->parent"
#132: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:535:
+	if (cgrp->parent == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#302: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:625:
+		ret = try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages(victim,
+				gfp_mask, noswap, get_swappiness(victim));

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#334: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:737:
+				mem_cgroup_out_of_memory(mem_over_limit,
+							gfp_mask);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#343: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:2044:
+		BUG_ON(!css_under_removal(&mem->css));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
