#35: 
In reenter_kprobe(), a breakpoint in KPROBE_HIT_SS case can only occur when single-stepping a breakpoint on which a probe was installed. Since such probes are single-stepped inline, identifying these cases is unambiguous. All other cases leading up to KPROBE_HIT_SS are possible bugs. Identify and WARN_ON such cases.
