CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:193:
+extern unsigned long try_to_free_pages(struct zone **zones, int order,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#76: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:194:
+extern unsigned long try_to_free_pages(struct zone **zones, int order,
+					gfp_t gfp_mask);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#198: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:702:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
