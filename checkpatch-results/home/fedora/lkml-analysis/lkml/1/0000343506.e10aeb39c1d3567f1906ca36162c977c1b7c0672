WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#28: 
A simplified version of the semantic patch making this change is as follows:

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#53: 
#include <linux/jiffies.h>

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#81: FILE: kernel/irq/spurious.c:182:
+		if (time_after(jiffies, desc->last_unhandled + HZ/10))
 		                                                 ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
