WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'alows' may be misspelled - perhaps 'allows'?
#156: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1785:
+ * This will impact the direct IO perf, but this alows direct IO and
                                                  ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'sucess' may be misspelled - perhaps 'success'?
#159: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1788:
+ * returns 0 in sucess case, and non zero in failure case.
                 ^^^^^^

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#168: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1797:
+	head = bh = page_buffers(page);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#184: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1813:
+        return ret;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#184: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1813:
+        return ret;$

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#219: FILE: fs/jbd/journal.c:567:
+	struct journal_head * jh;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
