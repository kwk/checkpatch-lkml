WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#92: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:1264:
+	unsigned long i = simple_strtoul(s, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
