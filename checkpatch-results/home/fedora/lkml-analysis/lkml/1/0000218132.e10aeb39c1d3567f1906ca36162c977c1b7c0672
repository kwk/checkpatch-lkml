#44: 
_ Adding a stack trace to know which function locked or unlocked the kernel.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#60: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#65: FILE: include/trace/bkl.h:1:
+#ifndef _TRACE_BKL_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: include/trace/bkl.h:22:
+extern void trace_bkl_acquire(struct bkl_trace_acquire *trace);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+	depends on HAVE_FTRACE

+	help
+	  This tracer records the latencies issued by the Big Kernel Lock.
+	  It traces the time when a task request the bkl, the time when it
+	  acquires it and the time when it releases it.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
