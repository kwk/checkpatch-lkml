CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#162: FILE: include/trace/events/timer.h:335:
+		  (int) __entry->pid, (unsigned long long)__entry->now)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#296: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1260:
+	entry_time = now = ktime_get();

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn_once([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn_once(dev, ... then pr_warn_once(...  to printk_once(KERN_WARNING ...
#348: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1363:
