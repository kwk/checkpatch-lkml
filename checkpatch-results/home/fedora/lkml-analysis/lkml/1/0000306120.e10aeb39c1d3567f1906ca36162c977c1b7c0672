ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

+u16 x86_cpu_to_apicid_init[NR_CPUS] __initdata =

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
