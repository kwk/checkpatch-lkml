#37: 
Some newer Lenovo models are shipped with a TPM that doesn't seem to set the TPM_STS_DATA_EXPECT status bit

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#63: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis.c:260:
+static int itpm = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#83: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis.c:474:
+^Iif (itpm) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#86: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis.c:477:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
