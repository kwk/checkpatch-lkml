WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'managment' may be misspelled - perhaps 'management'?
#261: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:505:
+ * BIO list managment for use by remapping drivers (e.g. DM or MD).
             ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bl->head"
#274: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:518:
+	return bl->head == NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#279: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:523:
+	bl->head = bl->tail = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'bio' - possible side-effects?
#282: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:526:
+#define bio_list_for_each(bio, bl) \
+	for (bio = (bl)->head; bio; bio = bio->bi_next)

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
