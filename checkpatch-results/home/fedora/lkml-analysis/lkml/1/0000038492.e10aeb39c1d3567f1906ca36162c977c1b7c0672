#40: 
detection with NAT (commit a3a9f79e361e864f0e9d75ebe2a0cb43d17c4272).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/net/netfilter/nf_nat_helper.h:36:
+extern s16 nf_nat_get_offset(const struct nf_conn *ct,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#101: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_nat_core.c:753:
+	BUG_ON(nf_ct_nat_offset != NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "nf_ct_nat_offset"
#101: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_nat_core.c:753:
+	BUG_ON(nf_ct_nat_offset != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "get_offset"
#208: FILE: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c:502:
+	return get_offset != NULL ? get_offset(ct, dir, seq) : 0;

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#210: FILE: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c:504:

+#define NAT_OFFSET(pf, ct, dir, seq) \

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'pf' may be better as '(pf)' to avoid precedence issues
