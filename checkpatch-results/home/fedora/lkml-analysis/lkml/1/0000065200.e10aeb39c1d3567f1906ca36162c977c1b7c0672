ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#45: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:317:
+inline void mddev_unlock(mddev_t * mddev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
