Subject: [PATCH 3/3] kbuild, modpost: fix unexpected non-allocatable warning with mips

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#63: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:730:
 static const char *section_white_list[] =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
