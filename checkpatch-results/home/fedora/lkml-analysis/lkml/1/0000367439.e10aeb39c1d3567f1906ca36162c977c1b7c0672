Cleans up some of the static early-boot memory allocations (nodemap, trampoline)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#177: FILE: arch/x86/mm/numa_64.c:199:
+		if (s < CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START) s += CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
