CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: include/linux/vmstat.h:177:
+extern void zone_statistics(struct zone *, struct zone *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#63: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1054:
+static struct page *buffered_rmqueue(struct zone *preferred_zone,
 			struct zone *zone, int order, gfp_t gfp_flags)
