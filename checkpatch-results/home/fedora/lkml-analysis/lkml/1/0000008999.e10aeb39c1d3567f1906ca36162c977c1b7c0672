WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#156: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:1075:
+	BUG_ON(bio_list_empty(&pkt->orig_bios));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
