Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'oprofile_spu_buff_create', this function's name, in a string
#305: FILE: arch/powerpc/oprofile/cell/spu_task_sync.c:490:
+			       "%s, line %d:  oprofile_spu_buff_create "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
