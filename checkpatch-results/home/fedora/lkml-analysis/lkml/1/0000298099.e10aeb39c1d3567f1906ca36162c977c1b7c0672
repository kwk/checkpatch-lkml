ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#45: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma.c:17:
+int iommu_sac_force __read_mostly = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
