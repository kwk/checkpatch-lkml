Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#85:

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct rtc_class_ops should normally be const
#306: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-nuc900.c:217:
+static struct rtc_class_ops nuc900_rtc_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*nuc900_rtc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct nuc900_rtc)...)
#319: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-nuc900.c:230:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
