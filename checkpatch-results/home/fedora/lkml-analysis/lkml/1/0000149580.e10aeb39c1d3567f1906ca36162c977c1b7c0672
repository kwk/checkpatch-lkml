CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#84: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:997:
+	if (tape->chrdev_dir == IDETAPE_DIR_READ)
[...]
+	else if (tape->chrdev_dir == IDETAPE_DIR_WRITE) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
