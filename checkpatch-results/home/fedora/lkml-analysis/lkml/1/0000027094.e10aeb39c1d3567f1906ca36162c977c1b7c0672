WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#58: FILE: fs/fcntl.c:715:
+	BUG_ON(20 != hweight32(

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#58: FILE: fs/fcntl.c:715:
+	BUG_ON(20 != hweight32(

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.
