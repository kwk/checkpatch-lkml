Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#284: FILE: Documentation/pps/ppsctl.c:1:
+#include <stdio.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'usage', this function's name, in a string
#297: FILE: Documentation/pps/ppsctl.c:14:
+	fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <ttyS> [enable|disable]\n", name);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#329: FILE: Documentation/pps/ppsctl.c:46:
+	if (argv[2][0] == 'e' || argv[2][0] == '1')
[...]
+	else if (argv[2][0] == 'd' || argv[2][0] == '0')
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'pps_show_assert' to 'assert_show'
#1763: FILE: drivers/pps/sysfs.c:40:

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#1764: FILE: drivers/pps/sysfs.c:41:
+DEVICE_ATTR(assert, S_IRUGO, pps_show_assert, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
