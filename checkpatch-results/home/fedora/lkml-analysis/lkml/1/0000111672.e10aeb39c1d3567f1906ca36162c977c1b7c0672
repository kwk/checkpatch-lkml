WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#60: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .25
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "of_find_property"
#119: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/of_device.c:238:
+		if (of_find_property(dp, "ranges", NULL) != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "of_find_property"
#213: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/of_device.c:293:
+		if (of_find_property(dp, "ranges", NULL) != NULL)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#650: FILE: drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c:4137:
+		 * packet, also make sure the frame isn't just CRC only */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'length <= 4'
#651: FILE: drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c:4138:
+		if (unlikely(!(status & E1000_RXD_STAT_EOP) || (length <= 4))) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!lowerdev->ethtool_ops"
#679: FILE: drivers/net/macvlan.c:331:
+	if (lowerdev->ethtool_ops == NULL ||

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!lowerdev->ethtool_ops->get_rx_csum"
#680: FILE: drivers/net/macvlan.c:332:
+	    lowerdev->ethtool_ops->get_rx_csum == NULL)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#887: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1108:
+extern int ext4_alloc_da_blocks(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#989: FILE: fs/ext4/file.c:43:
+^I^I        !EXT4_I(inode)->i_reserved_data_blocks)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#1117: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:2121:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#1280: FILE: fs/ext4/ioctl.c:293:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#1303: FILE: fs/ext4/mballoc.c:1453:
+	BUG_ON(ex->fe_len > EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(ac->ac_sb));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
