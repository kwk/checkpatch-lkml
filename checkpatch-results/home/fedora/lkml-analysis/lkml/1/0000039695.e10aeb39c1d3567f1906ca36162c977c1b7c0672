WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#115: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:165:
+module_param(global_cursor_default, int, S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#125: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:782:
+	    /* If no drivers have overridden us and the user didn't pass a
+	       boot option, default to displaying the cursor */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

WARNING:TABSTOP: Statements should start on a tabstop
#126: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:783:
+	    if (global_cursor_default == -1)

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (12, 20)
#126: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:783:

+		    global_cursor_default = 1;

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#183: FILE: include/linux/screen_info.h:69:
+#define VIDEO_FLAGS_NOCURSOR	(1 << 0) /* The video mode has no cursor set */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#204: FILE: include/linux/vt_kern.h:134:
+extern void hide_boot_cursor(bool hide);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
