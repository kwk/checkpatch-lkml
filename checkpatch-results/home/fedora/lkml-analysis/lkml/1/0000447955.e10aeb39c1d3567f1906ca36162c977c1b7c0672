CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'hwgroup->req_gen != hwgroup->req_gen_timer'
#66: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:1415:
+	if (((handler = hwgroup->handler) == NULL) ||
+	    (hwgroup->req_gen != hwgroup->req_gen_timer)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#66: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:1415:
+	if (((handler = hwgroup->handler) == NULL) ||

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
