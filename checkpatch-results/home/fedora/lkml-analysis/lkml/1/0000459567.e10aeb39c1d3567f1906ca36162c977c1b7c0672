WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#64: FILE: arch/i386/power/suspend.c:20:
+extern const void __nosave_begin, __nosave_end;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+	unsigned long nosave_end_pfn = PAGE_ALIGN(__pa_symbol(&__nosave_end)) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
+	return (pfn >= nosave_begin_pfn) && (pfn < nosave_end_pfn);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
