WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#62: FILE: include/asm-generic/signal.h:1:
+#ifndef __ASM_GENERIC_SIGNAL_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#103: FILE: include/asm-generic/signal.h:42:
+/*
+#define SIGLOST		29

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
