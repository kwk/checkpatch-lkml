The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#222: FILE: Documentation/idle/test_idle.c:147:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:WHILE_AFTER_BRACE: while should follow close brace '}'
#223: FILE: Documentation/idle/test_idle.c:148:

while should follow the closing bracket on the same line::

  do {
          ...
  } while(something);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
