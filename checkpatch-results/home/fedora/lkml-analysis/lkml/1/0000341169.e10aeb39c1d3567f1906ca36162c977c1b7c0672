CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#48: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/e820_64.c:823:
+#define EARLY_ALLOC_START (32<<20)
                              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#52: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/e820_64.c:827:
+	unsigned long p = find_e820_area(EARLY_ALLOC_START, -1UL, size);
+	if (p == -1ULL) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'arch_early_alloc', this function's name, in a string
#56: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/e820_64.c:831:
+			panic("arch_early_alloc %lu failed", size);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_EARLY_ALLOC' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#69: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgtable_64.h:439:
+#define ARCH_HAS_EARLY_ALLOC

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgtable_64.h:440:
+extern void *arch_early_alloc(unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
