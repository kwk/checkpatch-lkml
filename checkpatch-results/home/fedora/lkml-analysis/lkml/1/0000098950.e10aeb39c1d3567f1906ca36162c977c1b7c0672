CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/kmemleak.h:30:
+extern void kmemleak_free_part(const void *ptr, size_t size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#80: FILE: include/linux/kmemleak.h:75:
 }
+static inline void kmemleak_free_part(const void *ptr, size_t size)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#165: FILE: mm/kmemleak.c:584:
+		kmemleak_warn("Partially freeing unknown object at 0x%08lx "
+			      "(size %zu)\n", ptr, size);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
