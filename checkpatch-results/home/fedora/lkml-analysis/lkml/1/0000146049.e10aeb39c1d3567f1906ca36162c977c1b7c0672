CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*bmd->sgvecs)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct iovec)...)
#139: FILE: fs/bio.c:695:
+	bmd->sgvecs = kmalloc(sizeof(struct iovec) * iov_count, gfp_mask);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#271: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:784:
+extern int blk_rq_map_user_iov(struct request_queue *q, struct request *rq,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
