WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'netpoll_send_skb', this function's name, in a string
#50: FILE: net/core/netpoll.c:324:
+			KERN_WARNING "netpoll_send_skb(): [net driver %s]"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#51: FILE: net/core/netpoll.c:325:

+			"ndo_start_xmit() shouldn't return with interrupts"

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
