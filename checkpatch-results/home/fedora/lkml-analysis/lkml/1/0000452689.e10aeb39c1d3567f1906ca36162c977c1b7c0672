Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#80: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:48:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#109: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:77:
+	__ATTR(version, S_IRUGO, ubi_version_show, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#164: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:132:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#186: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:154:
+	sprintf(&ubi->dev.bus_id[0], UBI_NAME_STR"%d", ubi->ubi_num);

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#473: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:441:
+		ubi->vid_hdr_offset = ubi->vid_hdr_aloffset =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#475: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:443:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#574: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:542:
+		mtd_num = simple_strtoul(mtd_dev, &endp, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#594: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:562:
+	ubi = ubi_devices[ubi_devices_cnt] = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ubi_device),

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ubi_devices[ubi_devices_cnt])...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ubi_device)...)
#594: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:562:
+	ubi = ubi_devices[ubi_devices_cnt] = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ubi_device),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
