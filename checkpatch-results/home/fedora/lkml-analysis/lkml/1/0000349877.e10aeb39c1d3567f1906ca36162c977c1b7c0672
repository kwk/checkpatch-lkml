CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#159: FILE: arch/x86/lib/delay_32.c:50:
+	start = now = cpu_clock(this_cpu);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#305: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:2658:
+		if (DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(current->hardirqs_enabled)) {
+			printk("possible reason: unannotated irqs-off.\n");
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#336: FILE: kernel/printk.c:626:
+const char printk_recursion_bug_msg [] =

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'printk', this function's name, in a string
#337: FILE: kernel/printk.c:627:
+			KERN_CRIT "BUG: recent printk recursion!\n";

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
