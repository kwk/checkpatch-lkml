WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'e100_hw_init', this function's name, in a string
#270: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:1518:
+	netif_err(nic, hw, nic->netdev, "e100_hw_init\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#359: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:1784:
+			     (int)(((void*)cb - (void*)nic->cbs)/sizeof(struct cb)),

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
