CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!eeprom"
#91: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/af9015.c:568:
+	if (eeprom == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#106: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/af9015.c:581:
+		print_hex_dump_bytes("", DUMP_PREFIX_OFFSET, eeprom,
+				eeprom_size);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#108: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/af9015.c:583:
+	BUG_ON(eeprom_size % 4);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
