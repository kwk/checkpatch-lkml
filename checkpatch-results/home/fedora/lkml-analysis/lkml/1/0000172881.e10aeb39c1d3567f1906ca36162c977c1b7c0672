    Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#182: FILE: drivers/xen/manage.c:50:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "xen_suspend: sysdev_suspend failed: %d\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'xen_suspend', this function's name, in a string
#182: FILE: drivers/xen/manage.c:50:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "xen_suspend: sysdev_suspend failed: %d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#183: FILE: drivers/xen/manage.c:51:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "xen_suspend: sysdev_suspend failed: %d\n",
+			err);

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Power_up_devices>
#210: FILE: kernel/kexec.c:1472:
+			goto Power_up_devices;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
