CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#69: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:436:
+	total = (long) (mem->res.usage >> PAGE_SHIFT) + 1L;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#88: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:67:
+extern int mem_cgroup_calc_mapped_ratio(struct mem_cgroup *mem);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#90: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:69:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
