#35: 
This is an example about how to add eventfd support to the current KAIO code,

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#141: FILE: fs/aio.c:1576:
+		req->ki_eventfd = eventfd_fget((int) iocb->aio_resfd);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LIKELY_MISUSE: nested (un)?likely() calls, IS_ERR already uses unlikely() internally
#142: FILE: fs/aio.c:1577:

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#181: FILE: include/linux/aio_abi.h:54:
+#define IOCB_FLAG_RESFD		(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
