WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#54: FILE: Makefile:18:
+aio-read: aio-read.c syslet.h sys.h Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#61: FILE: aio-read.c:1:
+#include <stdio.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:ARRAY_SIZE: Prefer ARRAY_SIZE(a)
#91: FILE: aio-read.c:31:
+#define ARRAY_SIZE(a) (sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]))

The ARRAY_SIZE(foo) macro should be preferred over
sizeof(foo)/sizeof(foo[0]) for finding number of elements in an
array.

The macro is defined in include/linux/kernel.h::

  #define ARRAY_SIZE(x) (sizeof(x) / sizeof((x)[0]))

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - int collect_status() should probably be int collect_status(void)
#93: FILE: aio-read.c:33:

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
