ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#81: FILE: fs/inode.c:213:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

#460: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1897:
+extern int __cond_resched_lock(void * lock, int lock_type);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#460: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1897:
+extern int __cond_resched_lock(void * lock, int lock_type);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
