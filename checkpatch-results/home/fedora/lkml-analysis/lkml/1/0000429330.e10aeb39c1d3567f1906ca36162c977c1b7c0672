>> If we add 8 bytes to struct page on 64-bit machines, it becomes 64 bytes,

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#74: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:265:
+int put_page_testzero(struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#75: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:266:
+int get_page_unless_zero(struct page *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#76: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:267:
+void get_page(struct page *);
