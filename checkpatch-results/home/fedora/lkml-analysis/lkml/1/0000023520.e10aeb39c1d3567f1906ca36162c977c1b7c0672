#40: 
commit 486bad2e40e938cd68fd853b7a9fa3115a9d3a4a upstream.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#76: FILE: net/sunrpc/auth_gss/auth_gss.c:655:
+		case -ENOSYS:

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#82: FILE: net/sunrpc/auth_gss/auth_gss.c:661:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
