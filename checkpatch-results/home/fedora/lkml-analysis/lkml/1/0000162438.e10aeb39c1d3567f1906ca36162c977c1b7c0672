ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#185: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:2559:
socket *parent)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#202: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:2574:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#205: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:2576:
+	if (rc == 0) {
[...]
-	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#215: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:2586:
+			 * everyone when we suddenly drop the labeling later */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "smack_host_label"
#217: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:2588:
+			if (smack_host_label(&addr) != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#224: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:2594:
