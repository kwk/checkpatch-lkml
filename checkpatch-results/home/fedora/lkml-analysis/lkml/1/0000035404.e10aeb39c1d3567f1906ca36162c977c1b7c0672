#28: 
Daniel Bernstein has observed [1] that security-conscious userland processes

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#125: FILE: net/socket.c:582:
+	if (sock->sk->sk_family != AF_UNIX &&
+		!current->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_NETWORK].rlim_cur &&

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "msg->msg_name"
#126: FILE: net/socket.c:583:
+		(msg->msg_name != NULL || msg->msg_namelen != 0))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#179: FILE: net/socket.c:1498:
+	err = sock->ops->bind(sock, (struct sockaddr *) &address, addrlen);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#246: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1052:
+	if (test_bit(SOCK_PASSCRED, &sock->flags) && !u->addr

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#247: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1053:
+	if (test_bit(SOCK_PASSCRED, &sock->flags) && !u->addr
+		&& (err = unix_autobind(sock)) != 0)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#258: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1392:
+		if (!current->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_NETWORK].rlim_cur &&
+			!sunaddr->sun_path[0])

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#269: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1546:
+		 * See Documentation/rlimit_network.txt for details. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
