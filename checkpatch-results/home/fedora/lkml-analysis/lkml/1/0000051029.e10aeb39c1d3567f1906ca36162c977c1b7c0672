commit 3967684006f30c253bc6d4a6604d1bad4a7fc672 upstream.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 148 exceeds 100 columns
#166: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/therm_throt.c:131:
+		printk(KERN_CRIT "CPU%d: Temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled (total events = %lu)\n", this_cpu, state->throttle_count);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
