#36: 
> hx4700 touchscreen events were being dropped in ads7846_rx() because their pressure values consistently exceeded the platform maximum of 512; a sample of 256 pressure values were in the range 531 to 815. Doubling the platform maximum to 1024 allows hx4700 touchscreen events to pass the test.
