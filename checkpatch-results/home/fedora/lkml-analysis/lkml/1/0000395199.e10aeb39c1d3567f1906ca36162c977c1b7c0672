WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#21: 
Subject: [patch 18/18] Get rid of a bunch of sparse warnings again.

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#84: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/audit.h:1:
+#ifndef __ARCH_S390_KERNEL_AUDIT_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#90: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/audit.h:7:
+extern int s390_classify_syscall(unsigned);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/audit.h:7:
+extern int s390_classify_syscall(unsigned);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#194: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tty3270.h:1:
+/*

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#195: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tty3270.h:2:
+ *  drivers/s390/char/tty3270.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#274: FILE: drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_dbf.c:19:
  * Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
