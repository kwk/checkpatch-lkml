CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!alias_data->domain"
#155: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:1441:
+		if (alias_data->domain == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev_data->domain"
#166: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:1447:
+	if (dev_data->domain == NULL)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#182: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:1491:
+	BUG_ON(!dev_data->domain);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
