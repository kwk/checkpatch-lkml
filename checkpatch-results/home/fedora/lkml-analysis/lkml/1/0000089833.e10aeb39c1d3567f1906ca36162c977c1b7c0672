CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "root"
#125: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-res.c:108:
+	if (root != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#135: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-res.c:117:
+		const char *dtype = resource < PCI_BRIDGE_RESOURCES ? "device" : "bridge";
+		dev_err(&dev->dev, "BAR %d: %s %s %pR\n",

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
