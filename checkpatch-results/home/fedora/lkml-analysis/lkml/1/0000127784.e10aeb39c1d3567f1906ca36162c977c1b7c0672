#30: 
Corey noticed that ioctl()s on grouped counters didn't work on the whole group.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#116: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1279:
+static void perf_counter_for_each_sibling(struct perf_counter *counter,
+					  void (*func)(struct perf_counter *))
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct perf_counter *' should also have an identifier name
#159: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1321:
+	void (*func)(struct perf_counter *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
