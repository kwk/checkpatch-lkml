WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#40: 
This feature itself is very useful but "no operation" cgroup is not supported

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#104: FILE: kernel/cgroup_noop.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#105: FILE: kernel/cgroup_noop.c:2:
+ * kernel/cgroup_noop.c - No Operation Cgroup. Just for organizing process tree

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#113: FILE: kernel/cgroup_noop.c:10:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#116: FILE: kernel/cgroup_noop.c:13:
+static struct cgroup_subsys_state *noop_create(struct cgroup_subsys *ss,
+						   struct cgroup *cont)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#131: FILE: kernel/cgroup_noop.c:28:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
