Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: include/linux/rwsem-spinlock.h:71:
+extern int rwsem_is_locked(struct rw_semaphore *sem);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
