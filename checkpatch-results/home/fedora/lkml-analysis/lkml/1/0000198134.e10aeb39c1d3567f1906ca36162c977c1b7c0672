CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#93: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic.c:3803:
+
+			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#176: FILE: kernel/irq/internals.h:28:
+extern int irq_select_affinity_usr(unsigned int irq);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
