ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#55: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1778:
extern int force_sigsegv(int, struct task_struct *);

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1780:
+extern int __kill_pid_ns_info(int sig, struct siginfo *info, struct

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'nr <= 1'
#126: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1136:
+		if (!p || (nr <= 1) || !thread_group_leader(p) ||
+		    same_thread_group(p, current))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
