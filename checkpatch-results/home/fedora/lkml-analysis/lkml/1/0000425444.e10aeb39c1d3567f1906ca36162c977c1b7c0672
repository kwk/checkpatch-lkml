The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#143: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_pmu.c:83:
+	max1 = max2 = -1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#145: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_pmu.c:85:
+	for (i = 0; i < cfg->num_pmc_entries;  i++) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
