WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#30: 
+/- now denotes whether expectation fails in less than 5% of the tests - rather

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/compiler.h:63:
+extern int do_check_likely(struct likeliness *likeliness, unsigned int exp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#144: FILE: lib/likely_prof.c:65:
+		seq_printf(out, "[+- ]Type | # True  | # False | Function@"
+				"Filename:Line\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#185: FILE: lib/likely_prof.c:114:
+	seq_printf(out, "|%9u|%9u|\t%s@%s:%u\n", pos, neg, function,
+			entry->file, entry->label >> LP_LINE_SHIFT);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#194: FILE: lib/likely_prof.c:123:
+static struct seq_operations likely_profiling_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
