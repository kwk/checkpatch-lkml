WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#67: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp.h:740:
+	BUG_ON(cpqhp_routing_table == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cpqhp_routing_table"
#67: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp.h:740:
+	BUG_ON(cpqhp_routing_table == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cpqhp_routing_table"
#111: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_core.c:162:
+	if (cpqhp_routing_table == NULL)

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'work == 0xffffffff'
#273: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_pci.c:261:
+			if (!nobridge || (work == 0xffffffff))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#288: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_pci.c:275:
+			} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
