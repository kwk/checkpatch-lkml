Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#106: FILE: arch/x86/pci/common.c:176:
+static void __devinit pcibios_fixup_bus_resources(struct pci_bus *bus)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#116: FILE: arch/x86/pci/common.c:186:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#188: FILE: arch/x86/pci/pci.h:121:
+extern int pcibios_resource_needs_fixup(struct pci_dev *dev, int resno);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
