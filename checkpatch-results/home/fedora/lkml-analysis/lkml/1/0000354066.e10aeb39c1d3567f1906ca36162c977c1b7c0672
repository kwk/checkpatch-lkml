WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#86: FILE: arch/x86/Makefile:15:
+include $(srctree)/arch/x86/Makefile_$(CONFIG_BITS)

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
