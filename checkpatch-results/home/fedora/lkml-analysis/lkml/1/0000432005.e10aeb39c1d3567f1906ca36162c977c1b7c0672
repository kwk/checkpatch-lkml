WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#39: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#44: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1682.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ds1682_show', this function's name, in a string
#114: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1682.c:71:
+	dev_dbg(dev, "ds1682_show() called on %s\n", attr->attr.name);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#118: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1682.c:75:
+					   (u8 *) & val);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that '&' (ctx:WxW)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#123: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1682.c:80:
+	 * resolution, scale them up to milliseconds */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ds1682_store', this function's name, in a string
#141: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1682.c:98:
+	dev_dbg(dev, "ds1682_store() called on %s\n", attr->attr.name);

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoull is obsolete, use kstrtoull instead
#144: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1682.c:101:
+	val = simple_strtoull(buf, &endp, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#171: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1682.c:128:
+SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR_2(config, S_IRUGO, ds1682_show, NULL, DS1682_REG_CONFIG, 1);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
