WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#144: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1443:
+int ide_dma_prepare(ide_drive_t *, struct ide_cmd *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ide_cmd *' should also have an identifier name
#144: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1443:
+int ide_dma_prepare(ide_drive_t *, struct ide_cmd *);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#155: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1478:
+static int ide_dma_prepare(ide_drive_t *drive,
+			   struct ide_cmd *cmd) { return 1; }

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
