CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#116: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_console.h:92:
+extern void __hvc_resize(struct hvc_struct *hp, struct winsize ws);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#137: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_iucv.c:277:
+		 * is the case when called from hvc_iucv_get_chars() */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#138: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_iucv.c:278:
+		__hvc_resize(priv->hvc, *((struct winsize *) rb->mbuf->data));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
