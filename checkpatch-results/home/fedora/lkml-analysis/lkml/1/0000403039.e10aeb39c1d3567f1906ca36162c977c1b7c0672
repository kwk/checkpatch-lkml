#24: 
Reenable kprobes and alternative patching when the kernel text is write
^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#106: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:10:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#145: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:411:
+ * Warning: $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#153: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:419:
+        u8 *addr = oaddr;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#153: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:419:
+        u8 *addr = oaddr;$

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#155: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:421:
+		struct page *p[2] = { virt_to_page(addr), virt_to_page(addr+PAGE_SIZE) };
 		                                                           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#156: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:422:
+		struct page *p[2] = { virt_to_page(addr), virt_to_page(addr+PAGE_SIZE) };
+		addr = vmap(p, 2, VM_MAP, PAGE_KERNEL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#164: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:430:
+	/* Not strictly needed, but can speed CPU recovery up. Ignore cross cacheline
+	   case. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

#191: FILE: include/asm-i386/alternative.h:152:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
