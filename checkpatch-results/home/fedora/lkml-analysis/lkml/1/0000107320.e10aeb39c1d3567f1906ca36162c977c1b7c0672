WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#85: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#90: FILE: arch/m68knommu/platform/5407/gpio.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#103: FILE: arch/m68knommu/platform/5407/gpio.c:14:
+ * GNU General Public License for more details.
+*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#111: FILE: arch/m68knommu/platform/5407/gpio.c:22:
+ $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#111: FILE: arch/m68knommu/platform/5407/gpio.c:22:
+ $

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#132: FILE: arch/m68knommu/platform/5407/gpio.c:43:
+	unsigned i = 0;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#133: FILE: arch/m68knommu/platform/5407/gpio.c:44:
+	unsigned i = 0;
+	while (i < ARRAY_SIZE(mcf_gpio_chips))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
