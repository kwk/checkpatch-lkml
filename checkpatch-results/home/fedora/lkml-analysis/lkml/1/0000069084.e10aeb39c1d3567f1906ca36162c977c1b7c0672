Initially you can check whether those events are occuring:
                                                 ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

And i used 'perf report' to analyze where the MCE events occured:

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments

# perf record -R -f -e mce:mce_thermal_throttle_hot:r -e mce:mce_thermal_throttle_cold:r -e irq:irq_handler_entry:r -M -c 1 -a sleep 10

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.
