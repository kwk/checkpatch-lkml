#46: 
This patch adds kernel code to online/offline the CPUs soon_after/just_before

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#93: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/dlpar.c:309:
+			BUG_ON(get_cpu_current_state(cpu)

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#112: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/dlpar.c:328:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
