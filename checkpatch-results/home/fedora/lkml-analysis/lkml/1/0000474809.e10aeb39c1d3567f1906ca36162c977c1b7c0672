WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#156: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_bitbang.c:282:
+		unsigned		cs_inactive;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#170: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_bitbang.c:307:
+			BUG_ON(cs_inactive && !spi->master->can_cs_inactive);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
