CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#94: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/pci_of_scan.c:266:
+			if (i == 1)
[...]
+			else if (i == 2)
[...]
+			else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#335: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta_socket.c:755:
+	res->start = res->end = res->flags = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
