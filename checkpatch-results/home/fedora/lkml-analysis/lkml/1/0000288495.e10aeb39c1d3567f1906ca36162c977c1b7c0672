CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#265: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smp_32.c:435:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#412: FILE: include/asm-generic/tlbflush.h:1:
+/* include/asm-generic/tlbflush.h

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#412: FILE: include/asm-generic/tlbflush.h:1:
+/* include/asm-generic/tlbflush.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/mmu_context.h> instead of <asm/mmu_context.h>
#429: FILE: include/asm-generic/tlbflush.h:18:
+#include <asm/mmu_context.h>

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#432: FILE: include/asm-generic/tlbflush.h:21:
+/* flush an mm that we messed with earlier, but delayed the flush
+   assuming that we would muck with it a whole lot more. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_RELOAD_TLB' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#662: FILE: include/asm-x86/tlbflush.h:38:
+#define ARCH_HAS_RELOAD_TLB

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#703: FILE: include/asm-x86/tlbflush.h:135:
+extern void reload_tlb_mm(struct mm_struct *mm);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
