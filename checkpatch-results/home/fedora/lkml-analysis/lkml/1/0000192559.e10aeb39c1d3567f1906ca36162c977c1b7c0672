CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#239: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1674:
+extern long do_fallocate(struct file *file, int mode, loff_t offset,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
