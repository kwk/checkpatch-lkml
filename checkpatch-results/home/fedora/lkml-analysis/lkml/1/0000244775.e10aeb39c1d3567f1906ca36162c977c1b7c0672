CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/ppc32.h:138:
+extern int copy_siginfo_to_user32(struct compat_siginfo __user *d, siginfo_t *s);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "child->sighand"
#98: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace32.c:76:
+	if (likely(child->sighand != NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "child->last_siginfo"
#101: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace32.c:79:
+		if (likely(child->last_siginfo != NULL)) {
