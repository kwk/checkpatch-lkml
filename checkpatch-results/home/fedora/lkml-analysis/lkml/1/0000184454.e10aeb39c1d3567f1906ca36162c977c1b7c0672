WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'alligned' may be misspelled - perhaps 'aligned'?
#39: 
alligned length that has been used in ring_buffer_lock_reserve().
^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#56: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:120:
+	unsigned length = rb_event_length(event);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#57: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:121:
+	unsigned length = rb_event_length(event);
+	if (event->type != RINGBUF_TYPE_DATA)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#61: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:125:
+                length -= sizeof(event->array[0]);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
