#41: 
 cdd6c48 perf: Do the big rename: Performance Counters -> Performance Events

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'stucts' may be misspelled - perhaps 'structs'?
#43: 
accidentally renamed some members of stucts that were named after
                                     ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#231: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event.c:1734:
+	for (idx = 0; idx < x86_pmu.num_counters_fixed; idx++) {
 		checking_wrmsrl(MSR_ARCH_PERFMON_FIXED_CTR0 + idx, 0ull);
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:MINMAX: max() should probably be max_t(int, edx.split.num_counters_fixed, 3)
#320: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event.c:2111:
+	x86_pmu.num_counters_fixed	= max((int)edx.split.num_counters_fixed, 3);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#352: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event.c:2210:
+		((1LL << x86_pmu.num_counters_fixed)-1) << X86_PMC_IDX_FIXED;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
