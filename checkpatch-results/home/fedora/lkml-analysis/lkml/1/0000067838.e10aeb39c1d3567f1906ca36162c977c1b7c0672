WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#39: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .35
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/mmu-hash64.h:303:
+extern void slb_set_size(u16 size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#141: FILE: arch/powerpc/mm/slb.c:257:
+	extern unsigned int *slb_compare_rr_to_size;

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#193: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:570:
+			ata_dev_printk(dev, KERN_WARNING, "device reported "
+				       "invalid CHS sector 0\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#445: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsproc.c:191:
+^I^I^I           &cnt,$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#512: FILE: fs/udf/lowlevel.c:63:
+	if (ioctl_by_bdev(bdev, CDROM_LAST_WRITTEN, (unsigned long) &lblock) ||

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:OxV)
