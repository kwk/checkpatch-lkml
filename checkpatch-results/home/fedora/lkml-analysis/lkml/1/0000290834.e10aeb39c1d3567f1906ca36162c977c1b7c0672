Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#140: FILE: fs/afs/cmservice.c:461:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*call->request)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct afs_uuid)...)
#146: FILE: fs/afs/cmservice.c:467:
+		call->request = kmalloc(sizeof(struct afs_uuid), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
