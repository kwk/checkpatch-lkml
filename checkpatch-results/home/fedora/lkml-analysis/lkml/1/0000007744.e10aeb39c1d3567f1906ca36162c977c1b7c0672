Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#287: FILE: drivers/gpu/vga/vga_switcheroo.c:167:
+				   void (*set_gpu_state)(struct pci_dev *pdev, enum vga_switcheroo_state),

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#337: FILE: drivers/gpu/vga/vga_switcheroo.c:356:
+	if (strncmp(pci_id, "IGD", 3) == 0) {
+		client_id = VGA_SWITCHEROO_IGD;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
