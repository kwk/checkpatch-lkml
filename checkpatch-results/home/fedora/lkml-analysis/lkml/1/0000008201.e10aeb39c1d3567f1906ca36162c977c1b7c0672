CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buf"
#94: FILE: kernel/trace/latency_hist.c:450:
+	if (buf == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#98: FILE: kernel/trace/latency_hist.c:454:
+	r = snprintf(buf, strmaxlen, "%d %d %ld %s\n",
 	    mp->pid, MAX_RT_PRIO-1 - mp->prio, mp->latency, mp->comm);
