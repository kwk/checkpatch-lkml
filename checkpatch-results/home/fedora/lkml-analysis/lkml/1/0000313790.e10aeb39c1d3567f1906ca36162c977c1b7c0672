CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:14:
+extern int device_pm_add(struct device *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#191: FILE: drivers/base/power/main.c:82:
+			dev_err(dev, "added while parent '%s' is asleep\n",
+					dev->parent->bus_id);

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#306: FILE: drivers/base/power/main.c:452:
+				dev_err(dev, "suspended while a child "
+						"was added\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <PMAddError>
#346: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:823:
+		goto PMAddError;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
