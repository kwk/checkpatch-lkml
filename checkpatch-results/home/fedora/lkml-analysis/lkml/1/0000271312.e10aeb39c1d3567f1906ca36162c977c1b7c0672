The problem arises in commit 64e9159f5d2c which has uart_set_ldisc as follows:

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#53: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_core.c:1168:
+static void uart_set_ldisc(struct tty_struct *tty)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
