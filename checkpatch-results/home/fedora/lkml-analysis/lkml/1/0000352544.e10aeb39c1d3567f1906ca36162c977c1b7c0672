Ingo had expressed the need to reintroduce this patch asap and hence I resent 

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#60: 
#include <linux/cgroup_subsys.h>

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as

infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#101: FILE: include/linux/cpu_acct.h:1:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#109: FILE: include/linux/cpu_acct.h:9:
+extern void cpuacct_charge(struct task_struct *tsk, u64 cputime);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+	bool "Simple CPU accounting cgroup subsystem"
+	depends on CGROUPS
+	help
+	  Provides a simple Resource Controller for monitoring the

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
