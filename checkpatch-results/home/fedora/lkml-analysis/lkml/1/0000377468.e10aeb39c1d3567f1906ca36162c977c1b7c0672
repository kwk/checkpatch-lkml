CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'info->state != FBINFO_STATE_RUNNING'
#113: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:756:
+	if (((state == 3 && ret) || !ret) && (info->state != FBINFO_STATE_RUNNING))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#175: FILE: drivers/video/geode/gxfb_core.c:454:
 	if (state.event == PM_EVENT_SUSPEND) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 10)
#197: FILE: drivers/video/geode/gxfb_core.c:476:
+	if (gxfb_power(info, 0))
 	  printk(KERN_ERR "gxfb:  Powerup failed\n");

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct fb_info *' should also have an identifier name
#220: FILE: drivers/video/geode/lxfb.h:28:
+int lx_power(struct fb_info *, int level);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#279: FILE: drivers/video/geode/lxfb_ops.c:839:
+static int lx_power_state = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#375: FILE: drivers/video/geode/video_gx.c:372:
+		writel(gx_saved_regs.dc.r.gcfg & ~0x0F,
+		par->dc_regs + DC_GENERAL_CFG);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#382: FILE: drivers/video/geode/video_gx.c:375:
+		writel(gx_saved_regs.dc.r.dcfg & ~0x19,
+		par->dc_regs + DC_DISPLAY_CFG);

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#433: FILE: drivers/video/geode/video_gx.c:410:
+			for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#448: FILE: drivers/video/geode/video_gx.c:418:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "gxfb:  Panel power up timed out\n");

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#454: FILE: drivers/video/geode/video_gx.c:422:
+		   start the line count */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
