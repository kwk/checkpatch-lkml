Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#123: FILE: arch/x86/ia32/ia32_binfmt.c:50:
+extern int sysctl_vsyscall32;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#231: FILE: arch/x86/vdso/vdso32-setup.c:71:
+__setup("vdso32=", vdso_setup);

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#237: FILE: arch/x86/vdso/vdso32-setup.c:76:

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
