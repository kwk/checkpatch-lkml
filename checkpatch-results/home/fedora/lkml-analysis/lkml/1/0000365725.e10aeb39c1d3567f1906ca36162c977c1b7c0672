WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#90: FILE: lib/kobject.c:372:
+		struct kobject *temp_kobj;
+		temp_kobj = kset_find_obj(kobj->kset, new_name);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#92: FILE: lib/kobject.c:374:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'existance' may be misspelled - perhaps 'existence'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
