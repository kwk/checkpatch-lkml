#46: 
This patch tries to change behavior as following by charge/commit/cancel ops.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#134: FILE: mm/migrate.c:632:
+	BUG_ON(charge);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#183: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:62:
+extern void mem_cgroup_end_migration(struct mem_cgroup *mem,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#184: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:63:
+extern void mem_cgroup_end_migration(struct mem_cgroup *mem,
+	struct page *oldpage, struct page *newpage);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#300: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:783:
+void mem_cgroup_end_migration(struct mem_cgroup *mem,
+		struct page *oldpage, struct page *newpage)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#361: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:830:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
