WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#121: FILE: fs/unionfs/unlink.c:196:
+		struct inode *inode = dentry->d_inode;
+		BUG_ON(!inode);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#121: FILE: fs/unionfs/unlink.c:196:
+		BUG_ON(!inode);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
