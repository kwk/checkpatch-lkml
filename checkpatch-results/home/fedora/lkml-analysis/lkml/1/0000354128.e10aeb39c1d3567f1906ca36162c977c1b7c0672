#28: 
these utilities implemented in lib/hexdump.c are more handy, please use this.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#77: FILE: drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c:330:
+			print_hex_dump(KERN_DEBUG, "", DUMP_PREFIX_OFFSET, 16, 1, pc->buffer, 16, 1);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
