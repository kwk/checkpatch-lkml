CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*irq)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pnp_irq)...)
#64: FILE: drivers/pnp/resource.c:88:
+	irq = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pnp_irq), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
