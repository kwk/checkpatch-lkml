WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#54: FILE: security/selinux/avc.c:221:
+	BUG_ON(tclass >= ARRAY_SIZE(class_to_string) || !class_to_string[tclass]);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
