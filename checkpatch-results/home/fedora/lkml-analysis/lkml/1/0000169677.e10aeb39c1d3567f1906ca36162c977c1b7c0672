The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.

should be::

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 120 exceeds 100 columns

+echo "int foo(void) { char X[200]; return 3; }" | $1 -S -xc -c -O0 -fstack-protector - -o - 2> /dev/null | grep -q "%gs"

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
