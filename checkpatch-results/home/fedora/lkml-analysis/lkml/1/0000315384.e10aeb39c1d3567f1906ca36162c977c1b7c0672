WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .17
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!uninorth_node"
#59: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/powermac/feature.c:2580:
+	if (uninorth_node == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#104: FILE: drivers/macintosh/smu.c:139:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#136: FILE: drivers/macintosh/smu.c:482:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "SMU: Driver %s %s\n", VERSION, AUTHOR);

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#147: FILE: drivers/macintosh/smu.c:557:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "SMU: using NAP mode workaround\n");

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SCpnt>
#160: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:904:
+	u64 end_lba = SCpnt->request->sector + (xfer_size / 512);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#193: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:950:
+			u64 factor = SCpnt->device->sector_size / 512;
+			do_div(start_lba, factor);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#221: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:727:
+		!(NFS_I(inode)->cache_validity & (NFS_INO_REVAL_PAGECACHE|NFS_INO_INVALID_DATA));
 		                                                         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#240: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:756:
+	if (nfs_write_pageuptodate(page, inode) &&
+			inode->i_flock == NULL &&

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!inode->i_flock"
#240: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:756:
+			inode->i_flock == NULL &&

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#260: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/pmac_feature.h:402:
+extern int pmac_get_uninorth_variant(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#272: FILE: include/linux/ktime.h:292:
+extern ktime_t ktime_add_safe(const ktime_t lhs, const ktime_t rhs);

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#522: FILE: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c:961:
 	if (old_state != new_state
+	    && new_state == TCP_CONNTRACK_FIN_WAIT)
