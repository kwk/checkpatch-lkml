#49: 
This patch tries to change behavior as following by charge/commit/cancel ops.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#141: FILE: mm/migrate.c:632:
+	BUG_ON(charge);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#190: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:62:
+extern void mem_cgroup_end_migration(struct mem_cgroup *mem,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+	struct page *oldpage, struct page *newpage);
