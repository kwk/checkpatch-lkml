ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#46: FILE: src/cyclictest/cyclictest.c:149:
+static int tracing_thresh = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#83: FILE: src/cyclictest/cyclictest.c:1003:
+		case 1: tracing_thresh = atoi(optarg); break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
