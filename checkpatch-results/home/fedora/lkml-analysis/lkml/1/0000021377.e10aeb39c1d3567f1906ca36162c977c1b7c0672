Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#189: FILE: drivers/pnp/pnpbios/core.c:145:
+	value = call_usermodehelper(argv [0], argv, envp, NULL, UMH_WAIT_EXEC);

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
