WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#133: FILE: arch/x86/mm/fault_32.c:615:
+	if (unlikely(in_atomic() || !mm))

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
