Sorry, my mail client corrupted the previous mail containing the patch... it should be ok now...

Add a boot parameter (‘pci-mem-align’) which forces PCI memory regions to be aligned to 4K.

#37: 
This is very useful when developing an hypervisor, since in case we want to let native domains direct access to specific hardware, we don’t want PCI devices to share their memory region page with other devices. In Xen for example, PCI devices mmio resources are mapped by remapping complete pages (by Intel VT-d & the Neocleus pass-through patch for Xen).

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
