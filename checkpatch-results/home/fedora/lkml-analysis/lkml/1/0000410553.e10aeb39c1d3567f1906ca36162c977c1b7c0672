  - Uses software scatter-gather with a 64 KiB bounce buffer as the hypervisor

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#118: FILE: drivers/scsi/ps3rom.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#134: FILE: drivers/scsi/ps3rom.c:17:
+ * with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#150: FILE: drivers/scsi/ps3rom.c:33:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#301: FILE: drivers/scsi/ps3rom.c:184:
+	atapi_cmnd.blocks = atapi_cmnd.arglen = cmd->request_bufflen;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#473: FILE: drivers/scsi/ps3rom.c:356:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
