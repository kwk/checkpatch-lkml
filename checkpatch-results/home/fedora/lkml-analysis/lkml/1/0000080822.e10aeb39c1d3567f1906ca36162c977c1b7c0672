CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:217:
+extern void workqueue_set_lazy_timeout(struct workqueue_struct *wq,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#71: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:218:
+extern void workqueue_set_lazy_timeout(struct workqueue_struct *wq,
+			unsigned long timeout);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#93: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:74:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#187: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:333:
+			 * and move the work there. If we fail, fall through

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#200: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:346:
+			if (p) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
