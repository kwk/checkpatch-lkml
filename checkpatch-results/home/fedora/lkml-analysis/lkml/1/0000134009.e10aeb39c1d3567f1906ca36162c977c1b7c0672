CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/user.h> instead of <asm/user.h>
#81: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/elf.h:39:
+#include <asm/user.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument '_dest' may be better as '(_dest)' to avoid precedence issues

+#define ELF_CORE_COPY_REGS(_dest, _regs)			\

+	sizeof(struct pt_regs));

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#149: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/elf.h:107:
+	_r->r1 =  _r->r1 =  _r->r2 =  _r->r3 =		\

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
