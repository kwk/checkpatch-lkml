WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#99: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlm/dlmmaster.c:3263:
+	BUG_ON(mle->type != DLM_MLE_BLOCK);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#111: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlm/dlmmaster.c:3275:
+		 * dlmlock path which is fine. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
