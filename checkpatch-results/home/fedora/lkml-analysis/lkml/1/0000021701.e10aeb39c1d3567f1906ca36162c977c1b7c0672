Often the highest and lowest cpu speeds do not provide the the optimal

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#45: 
If load for normal and high priority threads are not high enough to increase

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#215: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c:476:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#238: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c:504:
