CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/percpu.h> instead of <asm/percpu.h>
#57: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/pda.h:10:
+#include <asm/percpu.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#166: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup_percpu.c:87:
 }
+#ifndef CONFIG_SMP

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
