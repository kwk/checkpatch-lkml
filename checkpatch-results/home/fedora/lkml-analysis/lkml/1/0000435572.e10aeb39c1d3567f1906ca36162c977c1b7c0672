The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#86: FILE: drivers/usb/input/appletouch.c:375:
+		dev->fingers_old = dev->x_old = dev->y_old = -1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
