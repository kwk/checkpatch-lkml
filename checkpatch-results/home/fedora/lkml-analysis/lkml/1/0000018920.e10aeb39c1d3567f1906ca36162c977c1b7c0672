WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT_ULL macro
#52: FILE: include/linux/perf_event.h:461:
+#define PERF_EVENT_RAW_BIT			(1ULL << 63)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#57: FILE: include/linux/perf_event.h:466:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#158: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:5391:
+			seq_printf(s, "0x%llx\t%s\t%lld-%lld\t%s\n",
+			PERF_EVENT_CONFIG_TO_RAW(entry->config),

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#202: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:5453:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "Cannot create debugfs entry 'perf_events_platform'\n");
