CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#85: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usbatm.c:1038:

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#88: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usbatm.c:1041:
+		usb_err(instance, "%s: failed to create kernel_thread (%ld)!\n",
+				__func__, PTR_ERR(t));

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "instance->thread"
#112: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usbatm.c:1293:
+	if (instance->thread != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
