WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#72: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.h:60:
+sector_t ide_gd_capacity(ide_drive_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#207: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-gd-floppy.c:98:
+static int ide_gd_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
                                                          ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!idkp"
#218: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-gd-floppy.c:106:
+	if (idkp == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#277: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-gd-floppy.c:156:
+static int ide_gd_release(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
                                                             ^^^^

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#337: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-gd-floppy.c:208:
+	struct ide_floppy_obj *idkp = ide_drv_g(disk, ide_floppy_obj);
+	set_capacity(disk, ide_gd_capacity(idkp->drive));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct block_device_operations should normally be const
#342: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-gd-floppy.c:212:
+static struct block_device_operations ide_gd_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
