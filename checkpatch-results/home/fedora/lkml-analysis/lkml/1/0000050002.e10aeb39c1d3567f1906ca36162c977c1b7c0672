WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#189: FILE: drivers/acpi/scan.c:1294:
+	if ((result = acpi_device_set_context(device, type)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer name
#306: FILE: drivers/net/bonding/bond_main.c:689:
+	int (* ioctl)(struct net_device *, struct ifreq *, int);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that '*' (ctx:BxW)
#306: FILE: drivers/net/bonding/bond_main.c:689:

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct net_device *' should also have an identifier name
#306: FILE: drivers/net/bonding/bond_main.c:689:
+	int (* ioctl)(struct net_device *, struct ifreq *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ifreq *' should also have an identifier name
#306: FILE: drivers/net/bonding/bond_main.c:689:
+	int (* ioctl)(struct net_device *, struct ifreq *, int);

WARNING:STRLCPY: Prefer strscpy over strlcpy - see: https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAHk-=wgfRnXz0W3D37d01q3JFkr_i_uTL=V6A6G1oUZcprmknw@mail.gmail.com/

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "state"
#500: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c:3559:
+		if (state != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

#511: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c:3568:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#641: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:203:
+extern void printk_tick(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#642: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:204:

WARNING:WAITQUEUE_ACTIVE: waitqueue_active without comment
#713: FILE: kernel/printk.c:997:

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#752: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:988:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
