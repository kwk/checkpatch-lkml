WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#86: FILE: drivers/md/dm-table.c:843:
+			DMERR("Inconsistent table: different target types"
+			      " mixed up");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#201: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:1573:
+	md->disk->queue = md->queue = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:NEEDLESS_IF: mempool_destroy(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required
#332: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:1733:
+	if (md->tio_pool)
+		mempool_destroy(md->tio_pool);
