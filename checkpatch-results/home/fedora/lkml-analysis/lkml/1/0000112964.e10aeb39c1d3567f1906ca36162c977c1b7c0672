    Lock a-kernel-lock.(wait thread2)         |    mutex_lock(&cpu_hotplug.lock)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#85: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:102:
+extern int try_get_online_cpus(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#105: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:17:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#165: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:70:
+		BUG_ON(!cpu_hotplug.active_writer);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
