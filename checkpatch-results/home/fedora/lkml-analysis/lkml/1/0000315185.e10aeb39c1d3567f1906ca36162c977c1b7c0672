+	  on how to choose a default I/O scheduler at boot time and also
+	  on a per-device basis at run time.
+
+	  To compile this scheduler as a module, choose M here; the module
+	  will be called cfq-iosched. A scheduler built as a module cannot
+	  be chosen as default.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
