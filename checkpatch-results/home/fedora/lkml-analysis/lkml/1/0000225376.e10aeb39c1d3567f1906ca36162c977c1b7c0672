CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*lapic)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_lapic_state)...)
#48: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:1549:
+		lapic = kzalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_lapic_state), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
