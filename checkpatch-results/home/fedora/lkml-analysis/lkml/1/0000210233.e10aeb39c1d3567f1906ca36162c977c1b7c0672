ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#155: FILE: drivers/staging/winbond/wbusb.c:305:
+	case 1: hal_halt( pHwData, NULL );

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
