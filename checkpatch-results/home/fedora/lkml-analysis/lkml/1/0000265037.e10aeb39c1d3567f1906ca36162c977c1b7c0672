WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#199: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:552:
+	int lru;
+	VM_BUG_ON(PageLRU(page));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#417: FILE: mm/mlock.c:271:
+	if (!page->mapping ||
+	     (PageAnon(page) && !page_mapcount(page))) {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#557: FILE: mm/internal.h:46:
+extern void putback_lru_page(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
