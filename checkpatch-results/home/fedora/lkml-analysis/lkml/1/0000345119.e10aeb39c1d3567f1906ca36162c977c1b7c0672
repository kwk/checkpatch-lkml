ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#96: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup_32.c:70:
+int disable_pse __cpuinitdata = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __cpuinitdata should be placed after smp_b_stepping
#109: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot_32.c:63:
+static int __cpuinitdata smp_b_stepping;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
