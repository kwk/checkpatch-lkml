Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#371: FILE: ipc/checkpoint_shm.c:67:

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#556: FILE: ipc/checkpoint_shm.c:252:
+	if (ret < 0) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
