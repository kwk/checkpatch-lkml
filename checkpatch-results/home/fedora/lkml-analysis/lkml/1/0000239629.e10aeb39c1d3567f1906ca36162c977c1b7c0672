CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2473:
+extern void prepare_free_task(struct task_struct *tsk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#168: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2398:
+    .free = task_pi_free_cb,$
