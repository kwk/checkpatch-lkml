CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#44: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/msi-laptop.c:73:
+#define MSI_STANDARD_EC_3G_MASK		(1 << 4)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#71: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/msi-laptop.c:237:
+static ssize_t show_threeg(struct device *dev,
+	struct device_attribute *attr, char *buf)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#73: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/msi-laptop.c:239:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'show_threeg' to 'threeg_show'
#94: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/msi-laptop.c:315:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(threeg, 0444, show_threeg, NULL);

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.
