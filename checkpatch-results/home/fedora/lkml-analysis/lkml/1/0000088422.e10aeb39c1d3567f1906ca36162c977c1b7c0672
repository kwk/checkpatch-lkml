#51: 
  - pte_special(), _PAGE_SPECIAL bit in pte is used for indicating ZERO_PAGE.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#157: FILE: mm/memory.c:1182:
+	if (HAVE_ANON_ZERO && pte_special(pte) && use_zero_page(vma)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
