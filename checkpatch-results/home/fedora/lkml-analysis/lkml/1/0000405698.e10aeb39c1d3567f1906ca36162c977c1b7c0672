WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#161: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:744:
+	ret = prev = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#164: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:747:
+		if (this > SCSI_MAX_SG_SEGMENTS) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
