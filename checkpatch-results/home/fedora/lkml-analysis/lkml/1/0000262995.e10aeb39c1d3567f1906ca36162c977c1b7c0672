WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'successfuly' may be misspelled - perhaps 'successfully'?
#58: 
I noticed a bug with respect to time drifting after multiple sleep/wakeup sequence. We have an embedded ARM11 based platform on which we have successfuly ported Linux. We also have a RTC on board. Hence we have implemented the read_persistent_clock() function overriding the one defined in kernel/time/timekeeping.c. What we observed was that after doing multiple sleep/wakeup sequences, the time reported by RTC and gettimeofday was drifting. After about 10 iterations the gettimeofday was lagging by about one second. Subsequently the lag only increased. 
                                                                                                                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
