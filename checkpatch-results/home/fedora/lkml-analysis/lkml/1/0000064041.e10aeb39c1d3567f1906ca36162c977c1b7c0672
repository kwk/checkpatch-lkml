CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#108: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:120:
+extern void __css_put(struct cgroup_subsys_state *css, int val);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#180: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:2117:
+		bulk_css_put(&mem->css,
+			current->memcg_batch.pages >> PAGE_SHIFT);
