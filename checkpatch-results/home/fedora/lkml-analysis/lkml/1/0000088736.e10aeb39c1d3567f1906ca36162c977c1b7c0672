#40: 
      Make SCSI SG v4 driver enabled by default and remove EXPERIMENTAL dependency, since udev depends on BSG

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#273: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:916:
+extern void blk_limits_io_min(struct queue_limits *limits, unsigned int min);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
