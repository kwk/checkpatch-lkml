Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_crit([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_crit(dev, ... then pr_crit(...  to printk(KERN_CRIT ...

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'calibrate_APIC_clock', this function's name, in a string
#247: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_64.c:458:
+			printk(KERN_CRIT "calibrate_APIC_clock: SMI flood - "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#248: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_64.c:459:
+			printk(KERN_CRIT "calibrate_APIC_clock: SMI flood - "
+				"the APIC timer calibration may be wrong!\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
