CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#99: FILE: block/blk-map.c:366:
+	rq->buffer = rq->data = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#145: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:391:
+extern int bio_map_kern_prealloc(struct request_queue *q, struct bio *bio,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
