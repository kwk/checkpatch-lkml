Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#130: FILE: include/linux/time.h:111:
+extern long do_utimes(int dfd, char __user *filename, struct timeval *times, int flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
