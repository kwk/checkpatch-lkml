WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#32: 
  sorry for insufficient description in my earlier post. I hope it is better

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#59: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:48:
+static unsigned long elf_map (struct file *, unsigned long, struct elf_phdr *, int, int, unsigned long);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#59: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:48:
+static unsigned long elf_map (struct file *, unsigned long, struct elf_phdr *, int, int, unsigned long);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+	addr = ELF_PAGESTART(addr);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#101: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:304:
+	/*
+	* total_size is the size of the ELF (interpreter) image.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#108: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:311:
+	if (total_size) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
