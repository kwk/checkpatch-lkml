WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config I2C_GPIO
+	tristate "GPIO-based bitbanging i2c driver"
+	depends on I2C && GENERIC_GPIO
+	select I2C_ALGOBIT
+	help
+	  This is a very simple bitbanging i2c driver utilizing the
+	  arch-neutral GPIO API to control the SCL and SDA lines.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/gpio.h> instead of <asm/gpio.h>

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*adap)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_adapter)...)
#228: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-gpio.c:92:
+	adap = kzalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_adapter), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*bit_data)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_algo_bit_data)...)
