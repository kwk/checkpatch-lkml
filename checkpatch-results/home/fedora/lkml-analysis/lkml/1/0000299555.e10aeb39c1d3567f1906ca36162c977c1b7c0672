WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#27: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#28: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:2:
+ * fs/logfs/super.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#65: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:39:
+	void *stack = (void *) ((ulong)current & ~0x1fffUL);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#71: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:45:
+			u64 ofs = sb->s_blocksize + i*super->s_writesize;
 			                             ^

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#72: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:46:
+			u64 ofs = sb->s_blocksize + i*super->s_writesize;
+			super->s_devops->write(sb, ofs, super->s_writesize,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#100: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:74:
+	const unsigned char *p = s;
+	while (n-- != 0)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#161: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:135:
+	 * for rw-mounts, if necessary */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#191: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:165:
+	iput(logfs_super(sb)->s_master_inode);
 	^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#266: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:240:
+	BUG_ON(super->s_dirty_used_bytes || super->s_dirty_free_bytes);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#278: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:252:
+int logfs_get_sb_device(struct file_system_type *type, int flags,
+		struct mtd_inode *mtd, struct block_device *bdev,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#345: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:319:
+static int logfs_get_sb(struct file_system_type *type, int flags,
+		const char *devname, void *data, struct vfsmount *mnt)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#356: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:330:
+		char *garbage;
+		mtdnr = simple_strtoul(devname+3, &garbage, 0);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#356: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:330:
+		mtdnr = simple_strtoul(devname+3, &garbage, 0);
 		                              ^

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#356: FILE: fs/logfs/super.c:330:
+		mtdnr = simple_strtoul(devname+3, &garbage, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
