WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#253: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:306:
+	if (unlikely(space == 0 || in_atomic() || !mm))

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'space == 2'
#272: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:324:
+	if (unlikely((space == 2) && !(vma->vm_flags & VM_EXEC)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
