CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#92: FILE: arch/um/include/kern_util.h:84:
+extern char *uml_strdup(const char *string);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: char * array declaration might be better as static const
#153: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/mem.c:33:
+	const char *dirs[] = { "TMP", "TEMP", "TMPDIR", NULL };
