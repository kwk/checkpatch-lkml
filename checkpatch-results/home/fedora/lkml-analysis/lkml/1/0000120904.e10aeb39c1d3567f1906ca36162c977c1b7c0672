CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*va)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct vmap_area)...)
#107: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:1034:
+		va = kzalloc(sizeof(struct vmap_area), GFP_NOWAIT);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
