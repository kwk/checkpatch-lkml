CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/net/netfilter/ipv6/nf_conntrack_ipv6.h:12:
+extern struct sk_buff *nf_ct_frag6_gather(struct sk_buff *skb, u32 user);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#97: FILE: net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_conntrack_l3proto_ipv6.c:194:

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
