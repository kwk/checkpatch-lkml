CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:86:
+extern void cpu_hotplug_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#80: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:87:
+extern void cpu_maps_update_begin(void);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:88:
+extern void cpu_maps_update_done(void);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cpu_hotplug.active_writer"
#116: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:39:
+#define writer_exists() (cpu_hotplug.active_writer != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
