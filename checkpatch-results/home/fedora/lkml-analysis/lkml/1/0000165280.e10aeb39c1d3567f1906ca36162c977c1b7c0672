WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns

+	{ "vt6410",	PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_6410,     0x00, 0x2f, VIA_UDMA_133 | VIA_BAD_AST | VIA_NO_ENABLES },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
