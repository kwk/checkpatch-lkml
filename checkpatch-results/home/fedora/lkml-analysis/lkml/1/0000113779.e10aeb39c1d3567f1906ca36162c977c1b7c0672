CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1620:
+extern int ext4_get_blocks(handle_t *handle, struct inode *inode,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'contigous' may be misspelled - perhaps 'contiguous'?
#220: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:5036:
+ * ext4_get_blocks() to map/allocate a chunk of contigous disk blocks.
