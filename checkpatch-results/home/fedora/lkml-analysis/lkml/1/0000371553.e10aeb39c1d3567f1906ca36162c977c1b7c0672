WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#44: FILE: security/tomoyo/audit.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#45: FILE: security/tomoyo/audit.c:2:
+ * security/tomoyo/audit.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#76: FILE: security/tomoyo/audit.c:33:
+		 "pid=%d uid=%d gid=%d euid=%d egid=%d "
+		 "suid=%d sgid=%d fsuid=%d fsgid=%d : %s : ",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#103: FILE: security/tomoyo/audit.c:60:
+		const char *msg
+			= is_granted ? "granted" : is_enforce ?

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
