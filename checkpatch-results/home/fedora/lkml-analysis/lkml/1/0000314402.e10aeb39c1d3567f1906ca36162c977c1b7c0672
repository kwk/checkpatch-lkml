CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#262: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/ide-4drives.c:43:
+			hwif->serialized = mate->serialized = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hwif"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
