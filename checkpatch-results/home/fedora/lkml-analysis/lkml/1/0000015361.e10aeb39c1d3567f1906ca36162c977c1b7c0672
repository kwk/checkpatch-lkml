CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#99: FILE: arch/x86/ia32/ia32_aout.c:319:
+	regs->r8 = regs->r9 = regs->r10 = regs->r11 = regs->r12 =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#221: FILE: fs/exec.c:961:
+void setup_new_exec(struct linux_binprm * bprm)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#253: FILE: include/linux/binfmts.h:104:
+extern void setup_new_exec(struct linux_binprm * bprm);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#264: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1357:
+				     - initialized normally by setup_new_exec */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
