The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#809: FILE: include/linux/mount.h:96:
+extern int mnt_want_write(struct vfsmount *mnt, const int reason);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
