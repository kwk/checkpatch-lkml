WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'tranfered' may be misspelled - perhaps 'transferred'?
#76: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/at91_mci.c:403:
+ * Update bytes tranfered count during a write operation
                 ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#93: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/at91_mci.c:419:
+			pr_debug("-> bytes_xfered %d, total_length = %d\n",
+				data->bytes_xfered, host->total_length);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#99: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/at91_mci.c:425:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#128: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/at91_mci.c:852:
+				 * command and send stop */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
