Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#84: FILE: include/linux/hugetlb.h:196:
+ 	return ERR_PTR(-ENOSYS);

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
