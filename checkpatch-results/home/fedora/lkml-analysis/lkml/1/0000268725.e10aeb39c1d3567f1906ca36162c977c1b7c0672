I found a bug which can be reproduced by this way:(linux-2.6.26-rc5, x86-64)

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#30: 
# mkdir /dev/cpuctl

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.
