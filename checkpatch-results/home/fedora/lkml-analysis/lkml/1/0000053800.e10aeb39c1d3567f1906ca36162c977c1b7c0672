CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#71: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_para.h:53:
+#define KVM_PV_SHM_FEATURES_ASYNC_PF		(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!per_cpu"
#130: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c:252:
+	if (per_cpu(kvm_vcpu_pv_shm, smp_processor_id()) == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#134: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c:256:
+	printk(KERN_INFO"Unregister pv shared memory for cpu %d\n",

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#134: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c:256:
+	printk(KERN_INFO"Unregister pv shared memory for cpu %d\n",

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#137: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c:259:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#148: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c:270:
+        .notifier_call = kvm_pv_reboot_notify,$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
