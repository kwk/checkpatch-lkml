WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#199: FILE: drivers/acpi/hardware/hwsleep.c:576:
+	if (ACPI_FAILURE(status) && status != AE_NOT_FOUND) {
+		ACPI_EXCEPTION((AE_INFO, status, "During Method _BFS"));
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
