WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'overriden' may be misspelled - perhaps 'overridden'?

                    ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_bus *' should also have an identifier name
#129: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:568:
+void pci_fixup_cardbus(struct pci_bus *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
