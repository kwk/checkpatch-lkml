#53: 
OK, I think I should have addressed your comments. Unfortunately I had to use 

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p_mtrr_usage"
#145: FILE: arch/x86/pci/i386.c:309:
+		if (*p_mtrr_usage == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#215: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:88:
+extern int pci_release_file(struct file *file);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Duplicate signature
#272: 
Signed-off-by: Thomas Schlichter <thomas.schlichter@web.de>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ot' may be misspelled - perhaps 'to'?
#316: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:496:
+	// round down size to next power ot two
 	                                 ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#320: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:500:
+	ptr1 = ptr2 = (base + size - 1) & ~(size - 1);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#447: FILE: fs/sysfs/bin.c:449:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct kobject *' should also have an identifier name
#475: FILE: include/linux/sysfs.h:76:
+	int (*release)(struct kobject *, struct bin_attribute *attr,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#476: FILE: include/linux/sysfs.h:77:
+	int (*release)(struct kobject *, struct bin_attribute *attr,
+		      struct file *file);
