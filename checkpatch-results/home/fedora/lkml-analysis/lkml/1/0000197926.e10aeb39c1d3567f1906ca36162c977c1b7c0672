WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#135: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-sysfs.c:63:
+	if (strict_strtoul(buf, 0, &val) < 0)

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#151: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-sysfs.c:139:
+	ssize_t result = strict_strtoul(buf, 0, &val);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#162: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-sysfs.c:148:
+	if (!val) {
[...]
-	} else if (*buf == '1')
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#188: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-sysfs.c:204:
+	 * attribute in the first place?  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

+			 " bad things could happen\n", val ? "" : " not");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
