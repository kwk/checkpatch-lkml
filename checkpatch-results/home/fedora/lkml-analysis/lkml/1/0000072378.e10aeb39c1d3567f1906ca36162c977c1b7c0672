> Add __GFP_ZERO to kbuf allocation, and just ignore vread()'s return value.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#188: FILE: include/linux/vmalloc.h:108:
+extern int vread(char *buf, char *addr, unsigned long count);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
