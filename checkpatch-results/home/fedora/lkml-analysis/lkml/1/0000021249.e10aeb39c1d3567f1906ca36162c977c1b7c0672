WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'verions' may be misspelled - perhaps 'versions'?
#42: 
The static verions in MIPS and SCORE are also made global.
           ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+int __attribute__((weak)) page_is_ram(unsigned long pfn)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __weak over __attribute__((weak))
#70: FILE: kernel/resource.c:335:
+int __attribute__((weak)) page_is_ram(unsigned long pfn)

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#72: FILE: kernel/resource.c:337:
+	return PAGE_IS_RAM == walk_system_ram_range(pfn, 1, NULL, __is_ram);

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#74: FILE: kernel/resource.c:339:
+}
+#undef PAGE_IS_RAM

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#85: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:194:
+extern int page_is_ram(unsigned long pfn);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
