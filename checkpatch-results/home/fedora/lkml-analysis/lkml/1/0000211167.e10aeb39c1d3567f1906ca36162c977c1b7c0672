CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#941: FILE: include/linux/ftrace.h:96:
+extern int ftrace_modify_code(unsigned long ip, unsigned char *old_code,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#1735: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:637:
+		if (ftrace_code_disable(p)) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
