ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#97: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:126:
+int maps_protect = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#141: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:457:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#150: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:465:
+        .show   = show_numa_map_checked$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#150: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:465:
+        .show   = show_numa_map_checked$

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#191: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:79:
+extern int maps_protect;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
