WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ser' may be misspelled - perhaps 'set'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct uart_ops should normally be const
#370: FILE: drivers/serial/altera_jtaguart.c:284:
+static struct uart_ops altera_jtaguart_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
