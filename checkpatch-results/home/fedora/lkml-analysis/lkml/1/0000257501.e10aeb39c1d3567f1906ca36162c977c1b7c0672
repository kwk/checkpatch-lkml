Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#81: FILE: include/acpi/acpi_bus.h:393:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
