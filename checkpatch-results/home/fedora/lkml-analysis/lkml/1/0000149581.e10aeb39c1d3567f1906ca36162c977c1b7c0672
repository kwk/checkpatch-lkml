CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#112: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:603:
+	if (opcode == READ_6)
[...]
-		atomic_set(&bh->b_count, 0);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "tape->buf"
#223: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:826:
+	if (tape->buf != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#584: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1908:
+	BUG_ON(tape->valid);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
