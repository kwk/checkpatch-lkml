This change in the struct scatterlist was introduced by this commit: 18dabf473e15850c0dbc8ff13ac1e2806d542c15

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#94: FILE: drivers/pci/intel-iommu.c:2013:
+		BUG_ON(!sg_page(sg));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
