WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#112: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1357:
+	return nd;
 	       ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#154: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1485:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#178: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1504:
+		struct zonelist *zl;
+		zl = node_zonelist(nid, gfp);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:ONE_SEMICOLON: Statements terminations use 1 semicolon
#265: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1539:
+	zonelist = node_zonelist(zonelist_nid, gfp_mask);;

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#274: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1551:
+		zonelist, high_zoneidx, ALLOC_WMARK_LOW|ALLOC_CPUSET,
 		                                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#350: FILE: include/linux/mempolicy.h:200:
+extern int huge_node(struct vm_area_struct *vma,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#351: FILE: include/linux/mempolicy.h:201:
+extern int huge_node(struct vm_area_struct *vma,
