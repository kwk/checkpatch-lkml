CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#55: FILE: include/asm-generic/bug.h:37:
+extern void warn_slowpath(const char *file, const int line, const char *fmt, ...);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#78: FILE: include/asm-generic/bug.h:64:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
