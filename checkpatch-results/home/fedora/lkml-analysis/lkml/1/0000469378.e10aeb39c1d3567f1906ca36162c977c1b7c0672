ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#53: FILE: security/keys/key.c:177:
*key)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#77: FILE: security/keys/key.c:204:
+^I^Ielse {^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#77: FILE: security/keys/key.c:204:
+		else {	

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#79: FILE: security/keys/key.c:206:
+			 * keyspace */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'keyspace_loop == 1'
#80: FILE: security/keys/key.c:207:
+			if ((keyspace_loop == 1) && (key->serial >= orig)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
