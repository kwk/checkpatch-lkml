WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#86: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb3/iwch_cm.c:1807:
+		err = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
