Subject: [PATCH] affs: fix shadowed variable sparse warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

#64: FILE: fs/affs/file.c:574:
+			u32 _tmp = be32_to_cpu(AFFS_DATA_HEAD(prev_bh)->next);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 118 exceeds 100 columns
#65: FILE: fs/affs/file.c:575:
+				affs_warning(sb, "extent_file_ofs", "next block already set for %d (%d)", bidx, _tmp);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
