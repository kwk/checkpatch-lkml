This code only works if the TMU channel 1 is initialized during the kernel boot

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#61: FILE: arch/sh/include/asm/ltt.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: arch/sh/include/asm/ltt.h:14:
+extern u64 ltt_read_synthetic_tsc(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
