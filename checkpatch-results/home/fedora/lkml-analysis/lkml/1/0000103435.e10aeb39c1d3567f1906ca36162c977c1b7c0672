WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#17: 
Subject: HTC Dream: framebuffer checkpatch cleanups

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#72: FILE: drivers/video/msm/mddi_client_nt35399.c:64:
+	if (wait_event_timeout(nt35399_vsync_wait, panel->nt35399_got_int,
 				HZ/2) == 0)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*panel)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct panel_info)...)
#119: FILE: drivers/video/msm/mddi_client_nt35399.c:195:
+	struct panel_info *panel = kzalloc(sizeof(struct panel_info),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
