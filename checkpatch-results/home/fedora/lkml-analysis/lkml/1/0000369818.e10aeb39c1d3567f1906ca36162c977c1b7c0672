Reorder source so that all the code and data for each interface is together.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#97: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:156:
+	priv->tail_vma = tail_vma = get_gate_vma(priv->task);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#101: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:160:
+	if (last_addr && (vma = find_vma(mm, last_addr))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "tail_vma"
#136: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:185:
+	m->version = (tail_vma != NULL)? 0: -1UL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'vma != tail_vma'
#149: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:198:
+	if (vma && (vma != tail_vma) && vma->vm_next)

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#166: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:215:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
