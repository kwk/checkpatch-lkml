CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#374: FILE: tools/perf/builtin.h:25:
+extern int cmd_trace(int argc, const char **argv, const char *prefix);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#390: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#395: FILE: tools/perf/util/debug.c:1:
+/* For general debugging purposes */

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#402: FILE: tools/perf/util/debug.c:8:
+int verbose = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __printf(1, 2) over __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2)))
#427: FILE: tools/perf/util/debug.h:5:
+int eprintf(const char *fmt, ...) __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2)));

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#510: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1014:
+	if (err <= 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#513: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1017:
+	} else

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#532: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1036:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
