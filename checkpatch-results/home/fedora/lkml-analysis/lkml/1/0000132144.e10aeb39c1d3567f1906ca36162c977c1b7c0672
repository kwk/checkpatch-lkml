Subject: [PATCH] kernel/posix-cpu-timers.c: fix sparse warning

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#63: FILE: kernel/posix-cpu-timers.c:1433:
+		if (likely(cpu_firing >= 0)) {
 			cpu_timer_fire(timer);
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
