ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#79: FILE: tools/perf/bench/mem-memcpy.c:27:
+static int		use_clock	= 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#102: FILE: tools/perf/bench/mem-memcpy.c:70:
+	if (clock_fd < 0 && errno == ENOSYS)

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#105: FILE: tools/perf/bench/mem-memcpy.c:73:
+		BUG_ON(clock_fd < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
