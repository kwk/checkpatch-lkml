#38: 
2.6.28-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#70: FILE: net/netrom/af_netrom.c:1086:
+	/* Build a packet - the conventional user limit is 236 bytes. We can
+	   do ludicrously large NetROM frames but must not overflow */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
