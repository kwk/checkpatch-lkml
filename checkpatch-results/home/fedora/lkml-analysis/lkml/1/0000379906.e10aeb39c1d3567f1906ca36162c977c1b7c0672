Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#112: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:1705:
+	BUG_ON(!subsys->active);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#115: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:1708:
+	 * with, and pin them so we can drop cgroup_mutex */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'cgroup_clone', this function's name, in a string
#183: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:1776:
+		       "Race in cgroup_clone() - leaking cgroup %s\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
