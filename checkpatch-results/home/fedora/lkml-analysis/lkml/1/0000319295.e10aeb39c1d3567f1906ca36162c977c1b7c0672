#43: 
Explicit timing delay is only needed in pcspkr for accesses to the 8253 PIT.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#97: FILE: include/asm-x86/i8253.h:16:
+/* accesses to PIT registers need careful delays on some platforms. Define
+   them here in a common place */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
