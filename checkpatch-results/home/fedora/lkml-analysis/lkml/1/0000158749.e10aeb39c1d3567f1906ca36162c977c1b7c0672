WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#56: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spufs/spufs.h:376:
+#define spu_context_trace(name, ctx, _spu) \
+	trace_mark(spu, name, "ctx %p spu %p", ctx, _spu);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
