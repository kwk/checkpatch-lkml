#34: 
the following/attached patch works around a [obscure] problem when an 2.6 (not sure/caring about 2.4) NFS client accesses an "offline" file on a Sun/Solaris-10 NFS server when the underlying filesystem is of type SAM-FS. Happens with RHEL4/5 and mainline kernels. Frankly, it is not a Linux problem, but the chance for a short-/mid-term solution from Sun are very slim. So, being lazy, I would love to get this patch into Linux. If not, I just will have to maintain it for eternity out of tree.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
