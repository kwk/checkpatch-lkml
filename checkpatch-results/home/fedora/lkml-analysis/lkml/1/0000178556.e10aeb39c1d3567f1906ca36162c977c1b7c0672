WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dma_map_ops should normally be const
#184: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/dma-mapping.h:212:
+	struct dma_map_ops *ops = get_dma_ops(dev);

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#186: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/dma-mapping.h:214:
+	BUG_ON(!valid_dma_direction(dir));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
