WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#73: FILE: virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:104:
+	BUG_ON(!ioapic);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#76: FILE: virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:107:
+	deliver_bitmask = kvm_ioapic_get_delivery_bitmask(ioapic,
+				dest_id, dest_mode);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#81: FILE: virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:112:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "vcpu"
#82: FILE: virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:113:
+		if (vcpu != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
