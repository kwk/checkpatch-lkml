commit ca109491f (hrtimer: removing all ur callback modes) moved all

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct hrtimer *' should also have an identifier name
#84: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:524:
+	enum hrtimer_restart	(*function)(struct hrtimer *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'funtion' may be misspelled - perhaps 'function'?
