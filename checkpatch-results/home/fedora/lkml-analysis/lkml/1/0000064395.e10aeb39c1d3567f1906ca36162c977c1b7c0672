ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#65: FILE: kernel/softlockup.c:100:
*table, int write,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#108: FILE: kernel/softlockup.c:133:
+	if (cpu != this_cpu) {
[...]
+	} else if (print_timestamp == touch_timestamp)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#128: FILE: kernel/softlockup.c:151:
+	if (now > touch_timestamp + cur_thresh/2)
 	                                      ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
