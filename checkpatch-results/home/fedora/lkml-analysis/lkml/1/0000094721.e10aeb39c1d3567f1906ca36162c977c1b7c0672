CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#110: FILE: include/asm-generic/hw_breakpoint.h:109:
+extern void bp_perf_triggered(struct hw_breakpoint *bp, struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#147: FILE: kernel/hw_breakpoint.c:86:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
