Subject: arm: struct device - replace bus_id with dev_name(), dev_set_name()

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#253: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/include/mach/memory.h:73:
+#define is_lbus_device(dev)	(cpu_is_omap15xx() && dev && (strncmp(dev_name(dev), "ohci", 4) == 0))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
