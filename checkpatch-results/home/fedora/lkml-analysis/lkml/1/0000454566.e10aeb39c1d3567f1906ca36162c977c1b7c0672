[PATCH, take3] getrusage() : Fill ru_inblock and ru_oublock fields if possible
                                                                     ^

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#69: 
# /usr/bin/time updatedb

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#188: FILE: kernel/fork.c:877:
+	sig->inblock = sig->oublock = sig->cinblock = sig->coublock = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
