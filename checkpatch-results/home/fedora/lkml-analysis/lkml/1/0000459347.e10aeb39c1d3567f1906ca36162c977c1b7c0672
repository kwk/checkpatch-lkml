CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#60: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1086:
+	if (time == MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#62: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1088:

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#64: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1090:
+		struct restart_block *restart;
+		restart = &current_thread_info()->restart_block;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
