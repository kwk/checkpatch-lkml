WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#58: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#240: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:1:
+#include <linux/kernel.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#245: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:6:
+#include <asm/uaccess.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#249: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:10:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 't->tls_array'
#261: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:22:
+		if (desc_empty((struct n_desc_struct *)(t->tls_array) + idx))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#322: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:83:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'desc' - possible side-effects?
#327: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:88:
+#define GET_LIMIT(desc) ( \
+	((desc)->a & 0x0ffff) | \
+	 ((desc)->b & 0xf0000) )

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited before that close parenthesis ')'
#329: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:90:
+	 ((desc)->b & 0xf0000) )

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'useable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'usable'?
#361: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:122:
+	info.useable = GET_USEABLE(desc);
 	     ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
