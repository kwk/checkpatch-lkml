WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Non-standard signature: 'Signed-of-by:' - perhaps 'Signed-off-by:'?
#29: 
Signed-of-by: Mike Travis <travis@sgi.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#285: FILE: include/asm-x86/topology.h:81:
+ * "warning: type qualifiers ignored on function return type" */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#287: FILE: include/asm-x86/topology.h:83:
+extern const_cpumask_t node_to_cpumask(int node);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
