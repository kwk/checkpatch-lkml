#35: 
This patch provides specific clock support for the SH7712. (This is my first ever patch, so apologies if I've not followed the procedure correctly!)

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#43: FILE: arch/sh/kernel/cpu/sh3/clock-sh7712.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#44: FILE: arch/sh/kernel/cpu/sh3/clock-sh7712.c:2:
+ * arch/sh/kernel/cpu/sh3/clock-sh7712.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#61: FILE: arch/sh/kernel/cpu/sh3/clock-sh7712.c:19:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct clk_ops should normally be const
#74: FILE: arch/sh/kernel/cpu/sh3/clock-sh7712.c:32:
+static struct clk_ops sh7712_master_clk_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
