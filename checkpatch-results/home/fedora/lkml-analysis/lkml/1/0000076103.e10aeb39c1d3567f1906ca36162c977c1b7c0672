WARNING:SIZEOF_PARENTHESIS: sizeof buffer->buf should be sizeof(buffer->buf)

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#126: FILE: include/asm-x86/kvm_host.h:248:
+	 * put it here to avoid allocation */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
