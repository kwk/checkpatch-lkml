Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: fs/ocfs2/acl.h:31:
+extern int ocfs2_check_acl(struct inode *, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
