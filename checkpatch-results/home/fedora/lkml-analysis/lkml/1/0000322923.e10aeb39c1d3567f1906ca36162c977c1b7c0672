The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#59: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#64: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9713.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+		u16 data = wm97xx_reg_read(wm, AC97_WM97XX_DIGITISER_RD);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#395: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9713.c:332:
+	while ((wm97xx_reg_read(wm, AC97_WM9713_DIG1) & WM9713_POLL)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#452: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9713.c:389:
+		if (pil) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#457: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9713.c:394:
+		} else

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'continous' may be misspelled - perhaps 'continuous'?
#477: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9713.c:414:
+		/* continous mode */
 		   ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#478: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9713.c:415:
+		if (wm->mach_ops->acc_startup &&

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#479: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9713.c:416:
