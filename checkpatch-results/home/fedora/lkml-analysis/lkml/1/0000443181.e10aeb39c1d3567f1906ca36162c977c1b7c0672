WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#58: FILE: fs/namespace.c:232:
+	BUG_ON(mnt->mnt_flags & MNT_USER);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#92: FILE: fs/namespace.c:937:
+static int do_loopback(struct nameidata *nd, char *old_name, int flags)
                                          ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#169: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:126:
+#define MS_SETUSER	(1<<22) /* set mnt_uid to current user */
                   	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#169: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:126:
+#define MS_SETUSER	(1<<22) /* set mnt_uid to current user */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
