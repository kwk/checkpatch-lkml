#35: 
> serial: turn serial console suspend a boot rather than compile time option

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#157: FILE: kernel/printk.c:754:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#171: FILE: kernel/printk.c:765:
+		printk("Suspending console(s)\n");

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#182: FILE: kernel/printk.c:774:
+		BUG_ON(!disable_console_on_suspend);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
