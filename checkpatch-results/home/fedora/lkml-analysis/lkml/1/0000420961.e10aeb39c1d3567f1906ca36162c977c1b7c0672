WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#56: FILE: sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c:979:
 static int __devinit azx_codec_create(struct azx *chip, const char *model)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#69: FILE: sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c:994:
+	codecs = audio_codecs = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#74: FILE: sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c:998:
+			struct hda_codec *codec;
+			err = snd_hda_codec_new(chip->bus, c, &codec);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
