>> The v3020 RTC can be connected to GPIOs as well as to memory-like interface.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!chip->ioaddress"
#124: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-v3020.c:81:
+	if (chip->ioaddress == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
