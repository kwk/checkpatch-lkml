#52: 
The more i think of it, I don't think removal of the SANE_SENSE flag is a good idea after we've made reasonable effort to detect it.  The problem is the buggy devices that trigger SANE_SENSE to be set by error in the first place because they lie about the additional sense length.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
