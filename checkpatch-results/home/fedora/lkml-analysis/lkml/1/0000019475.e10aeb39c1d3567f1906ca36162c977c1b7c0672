WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#81: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c:1:
+/* *  drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#81: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c:1:
+/* *  drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

#129: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c:336:

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#216: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c:517:
+	max_load_freq = max_ignore_nice_load_freq = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
