CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#71: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c:594:
+	option_independent = option = pnp_register_independent_option(dev);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#89: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c:668:
+				dev_warn(&dev->dev, "missing "
+					 "_STAG_STARTDEP tag\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
