CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#55: FILE: include/linux/mmzone.h:787:
+#define SECTION_SIZE		(1UL << SECTION_SIZE_BITS)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#70: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:305:
+	/* Adding non-section-aligned memory will give unexpected
+	   and unintuitive results. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
