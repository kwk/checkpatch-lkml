WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#551: FILE: tests/rtmutex-tester.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#610: FILE: tests/rtmutex-tester.c:60:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#611: FILE: tests/rtmutex-tester.c:61:
+	switch(td->opcode) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#721: FILE: tests/rtmutex-tester.c:171:
+	BUG_ON(tid == MAX_RT_TEST_THREADS);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#750: FILE: tests/rtmutex-tester.c:200:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
