CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*scomp)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ses_component)...)
#110: FILE: drivers/scsi/ses.c:527:
+	scomp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ses_component) * components, GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
