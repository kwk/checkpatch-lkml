WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#111: FILE: fs/ocfs2/stack_user.c:61:
+	BUG_ON(!mutex_is_locked(&ocfs2_control_lock));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'c->oc_conn->cc_namelen == len'
#114: FILE: fs/ocfs2/stack_user.c:64:
+		if ((c->oc_conn->cc_namelen == len) &&
+		    !strncmp(c->oc_conn->cc_name, name, len))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*c)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ocfs2_live_connection)...)
#133: FILE: fs/ocfs2/stack_user.c:83:
+	c = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ocfs2_live_connection), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#140: FILE: fs/ocfs2/stack_user.c:90:
+	if (atomic_read(&ocfs2_control_opened))
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
