WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#94: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/au1xmmc.c:205:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#118: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/au1xmmc.c:693:

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#176: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/au1xmmc.c:1011:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
