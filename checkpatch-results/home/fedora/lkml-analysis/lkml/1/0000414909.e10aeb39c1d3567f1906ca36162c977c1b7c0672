#34: 
	I've found a preemption problem in kernel/rtmutex.c:649.  The BUG_ON listed in the patch below makes sure a preemption event hasn't occurred since the thread last checked the owner of the lock.  If it did happen and the current task is now the owner, it asserts with BUG_ON.  With the RT-PATCH applied, however, interrupts are not disabled and preemption is possible.  The following patch removes the BUG_ON as it is an incorrect check in the rt kernel. I've checked the rtmutex code and it appears to handle this case just fine..
