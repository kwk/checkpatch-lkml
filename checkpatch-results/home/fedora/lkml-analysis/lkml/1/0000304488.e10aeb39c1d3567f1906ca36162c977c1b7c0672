Subject: [PATCH 140/148] include/asm-x86/user_64.h: checkpatch cleanups - formatting only

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
