WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'destory' may be misspelled - perhaps 'destroy'?
#34: 
Since __xfrm_policy_destroy is used to destory the resources

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: include/net/xfrm.h:508:
+extern void xfrm_policy_destroy(struct xfrm_policy *policy);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
