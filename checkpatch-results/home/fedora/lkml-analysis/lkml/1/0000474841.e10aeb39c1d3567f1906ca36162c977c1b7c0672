CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:231:
+extern void init_rcu_boost_late(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#556: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:389:
+	while (!list_empty(&list)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
