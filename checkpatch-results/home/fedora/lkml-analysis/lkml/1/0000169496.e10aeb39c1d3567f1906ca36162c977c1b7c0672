Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
