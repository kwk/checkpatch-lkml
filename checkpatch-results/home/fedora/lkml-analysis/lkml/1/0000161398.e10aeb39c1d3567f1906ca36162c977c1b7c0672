CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#123: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup.c:341:
+	_brk_start = _brk_end = brk;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#131: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup.c:349:
+	BUG_ON(align & mask);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#193: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:711:
+	if (within(vaddr, (unsigned long) _text, _brk_end))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
