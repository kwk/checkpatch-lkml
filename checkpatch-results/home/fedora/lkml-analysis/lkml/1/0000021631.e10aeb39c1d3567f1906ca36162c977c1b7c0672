CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#101: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/ptrace.h:138:
+extern int regs_query_register_offset(const char *name);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
