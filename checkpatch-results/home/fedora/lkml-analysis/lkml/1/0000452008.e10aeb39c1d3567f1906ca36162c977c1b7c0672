WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'analagous' may be misspelled - perhaps 'analogous'?
#39: 
That field replaces the analagous PCI-only support in parport_pc.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#128: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:635:
+		dma_addr = dma_handle = dma_map_single(dev, (void *)buf, length,

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
