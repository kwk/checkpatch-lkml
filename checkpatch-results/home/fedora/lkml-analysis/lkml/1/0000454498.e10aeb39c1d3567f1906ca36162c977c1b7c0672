Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#104: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:77:
+	fprintf(stderr, "getdelays [-dilv] [-w logfile] [-r bufsize] [-m cpumask] [-t tgid] [-p pid]\n");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
