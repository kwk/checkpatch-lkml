CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*lapic)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_lapic_state)...)
#59: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:1310:
+		lapic = kzalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_lapic_state), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*lapic)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_lapic_state)...)
#79: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:1325:
+		lapic = kmalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_lapic_state), GFP_KERNEL);

WARNING:NEEDLESS_IF: kfree(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required
#97: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:1431:
