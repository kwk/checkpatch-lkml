WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_crit([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_crit(dev, ... then pr_crit(...  to printk(KERN_CRIT ...
#38: FILE: init/main.c:616:
+		printk(KERN_CRIT "start_kernel(): bug: interrupts were "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'start_kernel', this function's name, in a string
#38: FILE: init/main.c:616:
+		printk(KERN_CRIT "start_kernel(): bug: interrupts were "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#39: FILE: init/main.c:617:
+		printk(KERN_CRIT "start_kernel(): bug: interrupts were "
+				 "enabled early\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
