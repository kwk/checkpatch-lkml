WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#219: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:379:

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#241: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:396:
+			ide_dump_status(drive, "media error "
+					"(bad sector)", stat);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#262: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:417:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#263: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:418:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
