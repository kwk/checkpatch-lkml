We should actually warn and panic in this case to avoid the user datas

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#77: FILE: fs/reiserfs/lock.c:43:
+	BUG_ON(sb_i->lock_owner != current);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
