Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:697:
+extern void perf_counter_output(struct perf_counter *counter, int nmi,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#93: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:2635:
+void perf_counter_output(struct perf_counter *counter, int nmi,
 				struct perf_sample_data *data)
