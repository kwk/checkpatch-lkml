#30: 
Add a signal control group subsystem that allows us to send signals to all tasks

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dummy)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct stateless)...)
#108: FILE: kernel/cgroup_signal.c:26:
+	dummy = kzalloc(sizeof(struct stateless), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buffer"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
