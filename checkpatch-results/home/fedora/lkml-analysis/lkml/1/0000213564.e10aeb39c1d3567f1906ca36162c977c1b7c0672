_ Adding a stack trace to know which function locked or unlocked the kernel.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config BKL_TRACER
+	bool "Trace Big Kernel Lock latencies"
+	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
+	select TRACING
+	select STACKTRACE
+	help
+	  This tracer records the latencies issued by the Big Kernel Lock.
+	  It traces the time when a task requests the bkl, the time when it
+	  acquires it and the time when it releases it.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
