CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: include/linux/async.h:19:
+extern void async_run(async_func_ptr *ptr, void *data);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#79: FILE: kernel/async.c:212:
+		newcookie = entry->cookie = next_cookie++;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
