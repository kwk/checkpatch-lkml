WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#64: FILE: drivers/char/Kconfig:935:
+config GPIO_EPIAPD
+	tristate "EPIA-PD VT8251 GPIO support"
+	---help---
+	  This driver provides access to the GPI/GPO pins on the VT8251
+	  EPIA-PD board.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#86: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#91: FILE: drivers/char/epiapd_gpio.c:1:
+/* linux/drivers/char/epiapd_gpio.c

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#91: FILE: drivers/char/epiapd_gpio.c:1:
+/* linux/drivers/char/epiapd_gpio.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#92: FILE: drivers/char/epiapd_gpio.c:2:
+/* linux/drivers/char/epiapd_gpio.c
+

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
