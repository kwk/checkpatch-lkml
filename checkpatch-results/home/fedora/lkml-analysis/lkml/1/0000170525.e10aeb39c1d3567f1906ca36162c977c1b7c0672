Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <__ClearPageGUP>
#162: FILE: include/linux/page-flags.h:245:
+#define __ClearPageGUP(page)	__clear_bit(PG_gup, &(page)->flags)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#215: FILE: mm/hugetlb.c:387:
+		orig_entry = entry = huge_ptep_get(src_pte);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#239: FILE: mm/hugetlb.c:411:
+				BUG_ON(!pte_same(huge_ptep_get(src_pte),

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#270: FILE: mm/hugetlb.c:519:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
