Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sb->s_bdev"
#81: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:547:
+	if (sb->s_bdev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1959:
+extern int isfrozen_bdev(struct block_device *bdev, struct super_block *sb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
