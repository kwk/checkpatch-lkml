CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*zfcpdump_save_areas[cpu])...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct save_area)...)
#223: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/smp.c:260:
+	zfcpdump_save_areas[cpu] = kmalloc(sizeof(struct save_area), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
