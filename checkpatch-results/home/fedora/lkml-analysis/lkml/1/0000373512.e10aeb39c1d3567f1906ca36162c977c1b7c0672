CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!gi->gl"
#99: FILE: fs/gfs2/glock.c:2006:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
