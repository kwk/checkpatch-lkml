WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#335: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:146:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#388: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:177:
+		} else if (wb->task);
+			wake_up_process(wb->task);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#388: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:177:
+		} else if (wb->task);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#583: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:511:

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#898: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:785:
+			work->sync_mode = sync_mode = WB_SYNC_ALL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
