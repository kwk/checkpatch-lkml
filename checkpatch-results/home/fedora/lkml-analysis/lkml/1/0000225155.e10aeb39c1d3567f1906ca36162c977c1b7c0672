CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:810:
+extern int make_pages_present(unsigned long addr, unsigned long end,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#50: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:811:
+extern int make_pages_present(unsigned long addr, unsigned long end,
+			int interruptible);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#63: FILE: mm/fremap.c:226:
+		make_pages_present(start, start+size, 0);
 		                               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
