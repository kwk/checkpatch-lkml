      ^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#143: FILE: drivers/spi/pxa2xx_spi.c:1006:
+	 * struct spi_device.mode[s], including SPI_CS_HIGH */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#158: FILE: include/asm-arm/arch-pxa/pxa-regs.h:1672:
+#define SSCR1_IFS		(1 << 16)	/* Invert Frame Signal */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
