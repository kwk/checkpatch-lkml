WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#75: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#80: FILE: drivers/mfd/wm831x-otp.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'wm831x_unique_id_show' to 'unique_id_show'
#142: FILE: drivers/mfd/wm831x-otp.c:63:
+}

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#170: FILE: include/linux/mfd/wm831x/otp.h:2:
+ * include/linux/mfd/wm831x/otp.h -- OTP interface for WM831x

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#329: FILE: include/linux/mfd/wm831x/otp.h:161:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
