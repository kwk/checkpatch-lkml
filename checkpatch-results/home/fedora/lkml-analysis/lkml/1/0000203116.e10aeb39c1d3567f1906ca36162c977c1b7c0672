WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'suport' may be misspelled - perhaps 'support'?
#33: 
Here is a patch which adds 8-bit bus width suport to the mmc
                                           ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#65: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/mmc.c:438:
+		unsigned ext_csd_bit, bus_width;

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#108: FILE: include/linux/mmc/host.h:120:
+#define MMC_CAP_8_BIT_DATA	(1 << 6)	/* Can the host do 8 bit transfers */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
