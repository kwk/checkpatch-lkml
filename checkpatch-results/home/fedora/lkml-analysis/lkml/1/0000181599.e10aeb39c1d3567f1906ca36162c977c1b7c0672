CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#134: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:333:
+extern int mutex_spin_on_owner(struct mutex *lock, struct thread_info *owner);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
