ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#46: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c:124:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'smi' may be better as '(smi)' to avoid precedence issues

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
