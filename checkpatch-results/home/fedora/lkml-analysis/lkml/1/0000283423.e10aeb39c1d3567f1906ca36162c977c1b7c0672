1) Apply the attched aim9 patch;
             ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'readn', this function's name, in a string
#163: FILE: pipe_test.c:496:
+				"\nMaximum iterations exceeded in readn(%d, %p, %d)",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'writen' may be misspelled - perhaps 'written'?
#174: FILE: pipe_test.c:526:
+				"\nMaximum iterations exceeded in writen(%d, %p, %d)",
 				                                  ^^^^^^
