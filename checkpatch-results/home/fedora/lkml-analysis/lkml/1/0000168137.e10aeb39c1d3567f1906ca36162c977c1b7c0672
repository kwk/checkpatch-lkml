Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#102: FILE: drivers/mtd/chips/map_ram.c:96:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#319: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtdchar.c:820:

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
