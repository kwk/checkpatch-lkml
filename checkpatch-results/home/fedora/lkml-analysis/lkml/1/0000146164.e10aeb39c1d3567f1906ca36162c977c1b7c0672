CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:516:
+extern struct perf_callchain_entry *perf_callchain(struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __weak over __attribute__((weak))
#113: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1661:
+__attribute__((weak))
