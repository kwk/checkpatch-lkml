WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#61: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-gpio.c:136:
 static int __devinit gpio_led_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#69: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-gpio.c:301:
+	int uninitialized_var(ret);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ret' should also have an identifier name
#69: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-gpio.c:301:
+	int uninitialized_var(ret);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
