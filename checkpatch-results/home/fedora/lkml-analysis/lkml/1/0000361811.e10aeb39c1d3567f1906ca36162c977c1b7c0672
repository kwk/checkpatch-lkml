The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+		unsigned long foo = 0;
+		__asm__ __volatile__("cmovz %0, %1" : "=r" (foo) : "0" (foo));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
