CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#74: FILE: include/linux/vbus.h:154:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'node' - possible side-effects?
#126: FILE: kernel/vbus/core.c:373:
+#define for_each_rbnode(node, root) \
+	for (node = rb_first(root); node != NULL; node = rb_next(node))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "node"
#127: FILE: kernel/vbus/core.c:374:
+	for (node = rb_first(root); node != NULL; node = rb_next(node))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
