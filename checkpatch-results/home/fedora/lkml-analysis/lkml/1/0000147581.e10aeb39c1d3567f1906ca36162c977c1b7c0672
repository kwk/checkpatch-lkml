comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.h:605:
+extern unsigned long long ns2usecs(cycle_t nsec);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
