WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#116: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#295: FILE: include/asm-x86/bitops.h:316:
+unsigned long find_next_bit(const unsigned long *addr,
+		unsigned long size, unsigned long offset);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#297: FILE: include/asm-x86/bitops.h:318:
+unsigned long find_next_zero_bit(const unsigned long *addr,
+		unsigned long size, unsigned long offset);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#299: FILE: include/asm-x86/bitops.h:320:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
