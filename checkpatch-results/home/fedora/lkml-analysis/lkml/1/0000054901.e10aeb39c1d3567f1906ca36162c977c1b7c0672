CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: include/linux/bootmem.h:56:
+extern void free_bootmem_late(unsigned long addr, unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#86: FILE: mm/bootmem.c:179:
+			unsigned long idx = cursor - start;
+			vec = ~map[idx / BITS_PER_LONG];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
