file to configure weight and ioprio_class for each device in a given cgroup.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "p"
#217: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:1284:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#226: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:1293:

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
