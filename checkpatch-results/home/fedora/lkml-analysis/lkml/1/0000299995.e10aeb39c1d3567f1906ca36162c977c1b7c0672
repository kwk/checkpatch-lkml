ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#158: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlm/dlmlock.c:56:
+static struct kmem_cache *dlm_lock_cache = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
