WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#119: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-res.c:142:
+	BUG_ON(!align);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#149: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-res.c:235:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "PCI: bogus alignment of resource "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#150: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-res.c:236:

+				"%d [%llx:%llx] (flags %lx) of %s\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
