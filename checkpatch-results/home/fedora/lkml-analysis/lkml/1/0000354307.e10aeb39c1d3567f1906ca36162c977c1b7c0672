Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "up->port.info"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "up->port.info->tty"

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#318: FILE: drivers/serial/ip22zilog.c:696:
+		unsigned char stat = read_zsreg(channel, R1);
+		if (stat & ALL_SNT)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#320: FILE: drivers/serial/ip22zilog.c:698:
+		udelay(100);

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/timers/timers-howto.html#delays-information-on-the-various-kernel-delay-sleep-mechanisms

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#329: FILE: drivers/serial/ip22zilog.c:707:
+	(void) read_zsreg(channel, R0);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
