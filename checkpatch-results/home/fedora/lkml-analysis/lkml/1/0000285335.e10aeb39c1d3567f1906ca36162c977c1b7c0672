patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#192: FILE: arch/microblaze/Kconfig:143:
+source "arch/microblaze/Kconfig.debug"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
