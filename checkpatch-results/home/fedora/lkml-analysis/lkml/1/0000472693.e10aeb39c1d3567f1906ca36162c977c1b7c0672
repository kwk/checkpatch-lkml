#30: 
Add fb_append_extra_logo(), to append extra lines of logos below the standard

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#51: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:327:
+static unsigned int fb_logo_ex_num = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#139: FILE: include/linux/linux_logo.h:50:
+extern void fb_append_extra_logo(const struct linux_logo *logo,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
