CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "req->ki_eventfd"
#103: FILE: fs/aio.c:488:
+	if (req->ki_eventfd != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#160: FILE: fs/aio.c:1615:
+		req->ki_eventfd = eventfd_ctx_fdget((int) iocb->aio_resfd);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#408: FILE: include/linux/eventfd.h:45:
+	return ERR_PTR(-ENOSYS);

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#418: FILE: include/linux/eventfd.h:55:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
