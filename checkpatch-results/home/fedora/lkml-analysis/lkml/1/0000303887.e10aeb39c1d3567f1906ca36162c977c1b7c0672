CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'err_mask == AC_ERR_DEV'
#118: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:2100:
+		if ((err_mask == AC_ERR_DEV) && (tf.feature & ATA_ABORTED)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:TYPECAST_INT_CONSTANT: Unnecessary typecast of c90 int constant - '(unsigned int)63' could be '63U'

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#260: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_promise.c:639:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#267: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_promise.c:646:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#283: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_promise.c:662:
+	BUG_ON(i >= nr_ports);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#423: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:1363:
+	qc->nbytes = qc->extrabytes = qc->curbytes = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
