ERROR:WEAK_DECLARATION: Using weak declarations can have unintended link defects

Using weak declarations like __attribute__((weak)) or __weak
can have unintended link defects.  Avoid using them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#50: FILE: kernel/ksysfs.c:69:
+extern const char __stop_notes __attribute__((weak));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#63: FILE: kernel/ksysfs.c:82:
+		.mode = S_IRUGO,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
