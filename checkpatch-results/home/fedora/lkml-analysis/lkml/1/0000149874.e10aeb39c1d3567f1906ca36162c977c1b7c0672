WARNING:PREFER_SEQ_PUTS: Prefer seq_puts to seq_printf
#146: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:368:
+	seq_printf(m, "    ");

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#339: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_output.h:23:
+extern void trace_print_seq(struct seq_file *m, struct trace_seq *s);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
