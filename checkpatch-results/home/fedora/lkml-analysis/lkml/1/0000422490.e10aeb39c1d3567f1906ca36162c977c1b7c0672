WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#115: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:397:
+						if (print_task_context_switch_rates)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#116: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:398:
+							task_context_switch_rates((struct taskstats *) NLA_DATA(na));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#116: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:398:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+static inline char *task_context_switch_rates(struct task_struct *p, char *buffer)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
