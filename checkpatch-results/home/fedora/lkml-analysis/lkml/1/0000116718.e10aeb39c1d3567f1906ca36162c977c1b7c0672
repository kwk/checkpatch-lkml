WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#44: 
#!/bin/sh

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#149: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic/io_apic.c:2369:
+	 * information in the IO-APIC RTE. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
