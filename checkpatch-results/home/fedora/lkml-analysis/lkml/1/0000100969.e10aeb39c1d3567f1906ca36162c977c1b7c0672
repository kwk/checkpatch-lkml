#38: 
Ensures correct concurrent opening/reading of pidlists across pid namespaces

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: struct mutex definition without comment
#114: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:219:
+	struct mutex pidlist_mutex;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#139: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:649:
+	BUG_ON(!list_empty(&cgrp->pidlists));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#169: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2187:
+	struct pid_namespace *ns = get_pid_ns(current->nsproxy->pid_ns);
+	mutex_lock(&cgrp->pidlist_mutex);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*l)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct cgroup_pidlist)...)
#182: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2200:
+	l = kmalloc(sizeof(struct cgroup_pidlist), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
