CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/cred.h:161:
+extern void __put_cred(struct cred *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/linux/cred.h:162:
+extern int copy_creds(struct task_struct *, unsigned long);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct task_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#66: FILE: include/linux/cred.h:162:
+extern int copy_creds(struct task_struct *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#174: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1404:
+	int (*cred_alloc_security) (struct cred *cred);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#219: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#224: FILE: kernel/cred.c:1:
+/* Task credentials management

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#263: FILE: kernel/cred.c:40:
+	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&cred->usage) != 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#314: FILE: kernel/cred.c:91:
+	 * pointer yet, barring us */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#515: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:3214:
+	struct task_security_struct *tsec = cred->security;
+	cred->security = NULL;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
