Move the effective capabilities mask from the task struct into the credentials

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#220: FILE: include/linux/cred.h:50:
+extern void change_cap(struct cred *, kernel_cap_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct cred *' should also have an identifier name
#220: FILE: include/linux/cred.h:50:
+extern void change_cap(struct cred *, kernel_cap_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'kernel_cap_t' should also have an identifier name
#220: FILE: include/linux/cred.h:50:
+extern void change_cap(struct cred *, kernel_cap_t);

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#404: FILE: kernel/cred.c:208:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(change_cap);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#881: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:132:
+	if (cap_t(cap_effective) & CAP_TO_MASK(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) ||
 				p->uid == 0 || p->euid == 0)

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#1110: FILE: security/dummy.c:85:
+	if (cap_raised (cap_effective, cap))
