Add a helper routine returning the lowest power (highest number) ACPI device

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct device *' should also have an identifier name
#145: FILE: include/acpi/acpi_bus.h:367:
+int acpi_pm_device_sleep_state(struct device *, int, int *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
