WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#74: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:65:
+/* Disable local APIC timer from the kernel commandline or via dmi quirk
+   or using CPU MSR check */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
