WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary

+static int __devinit

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ace_of_probe', this function's name, in a string
#70: FILE: drivers/block/xsysace.c:1177:
+	dev_dbg(&op->dev, "ace_of_probe(%p, %p)\n", op, match);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __devinit should be placed after ace_of_match[]
#102: FILE: drivers/block/xsysace.c:1209:
+static struct of_device_id __devinit ace_of_match[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct of_device_id should normally be const
#102: FILE: drivers/block/xsysace.c:1209:
+static struct of_device_id __devinit ace_of_match[] = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
