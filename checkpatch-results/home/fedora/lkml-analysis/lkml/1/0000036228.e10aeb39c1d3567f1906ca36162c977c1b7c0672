WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#95: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1618:
+	spinlock_t *lock = ext4_group_lock_ptr(sb, group);
+	if (spin_trylock(lock))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#101: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1624:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'size == isize'
#124: FILE: fs/ext4/mballoc.c:4161:
+	if ((size == isize) &&
+	    !ext4_fs_is_busy(sbi) &&
+	    (atomic_read(&ac->ac_inode->i_writecount) == 0)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
