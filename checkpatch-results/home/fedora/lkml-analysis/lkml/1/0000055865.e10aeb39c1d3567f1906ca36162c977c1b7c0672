CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#64: FILE: arch/mips/include/asm/time.h:76:
+extern int init_r4k_timecounter(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: arch/mips/include/asm/time.h:77:
+extern u64 r4k_timecounter_read(void);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#133: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/csrc-r4k.c:62:
+	r4k_cc.mult = div_sc((unsigned long)mips_hpt_frequency, NSEC_PER_SEC,
+			32);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "r4k_tc.cc"
#144: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/csrc-r4k.c:73:
+	if (r4k_tc.cc != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
