The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#226: FILE: kernel/freezer.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#250: FILE: kernel/freezer.c:26:
+static inline int freezeable(struct task_struct * p)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p == current'

+	if ((p == current) ||
+	    (p->flags & PF_NOFREEZE) ||
+	    (p->exit_state != 0))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#263: FILE: kernel/freezer.c:39:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'refrigerator', this function's name, in a string
#275: FILE: kernel/freezer.c:51:
+	pr_debug("%s entered refrigerator\n", current->comm);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
