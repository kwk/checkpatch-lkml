WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#104: FILE: drivers/video/console/Kconfig:121:
+config FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_DETECT_PRIMARY
+       bool "Map the console to the primary display device"
+       depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE && VT_HW_CONSOLE_BINDING
+       default n
+       ---help---
+         If this option is selected, the framebuffer console will
+         automatically select the primary display device (if the architecture
+	 supports this feature).  Otherwise, the framebuffer console will
+         always select the first framebuffer driver that is loaded. The latter
+         is the default behavior.
+
+	 You can always override the automatic selection of the primary device
+	 by using the fbcon=map: boot option.
+
+	 To select this feature, "Support for binding and unbinding console
+         drivers", under "Device Drivers"->"Character Devices" must be set to
+	 y.
+
+	 If unsure, select n.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
