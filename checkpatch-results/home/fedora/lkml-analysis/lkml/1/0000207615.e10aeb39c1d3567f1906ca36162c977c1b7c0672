WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#83: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1390.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#177: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1390.c:95:
+	 * Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Day, Date, Month / Century, Year */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
