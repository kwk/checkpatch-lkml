CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:174:
+extern void show_slabs(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#77: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:176:
+#define show_slabs(void)	do { } while (0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
