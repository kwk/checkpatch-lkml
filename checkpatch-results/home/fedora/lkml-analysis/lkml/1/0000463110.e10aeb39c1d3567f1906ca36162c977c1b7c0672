WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#56: FILE: fs/compat.c:112:
+asmlinkage long compat_sys_lutimesat(int dfd, char __user *filename, struct compat_timespec __user *utimes)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: include/linux/time.h:113:
+extern long do_utimes_nsec(int dfd, char __user *filename, struct timespec *times, int flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
