The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __cpuinitdata should be placed after blk_cpu_notifier
#325: FILE: block/blk-softirq.c:80:
+static struct notifier_block __cpuinitdata blk_cpu_notifier = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#367: FILE: block/blk-softirq.c:101:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#424: FILE: block/blk-sysfs.c:152:

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#483: FILE: block/blk-sysfs.c:239:
+	.attr = {.name = "completion_affinity", .mode = S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR },

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#573: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:719:
+extern int blk_queue_set_queue_cpu(struct request_queue *, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#573: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:719:
+extern int blk_queue_set_queue_cpu(struct request_queue *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
