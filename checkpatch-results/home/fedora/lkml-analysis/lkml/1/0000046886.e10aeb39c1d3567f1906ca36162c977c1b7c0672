Before throttling a group, try to borrow runtime from groups that have excess.

WARNING:TABSTOP: Statements should start on a tabstop

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#177: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:293:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
