Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct clk_icst307 *' should also have an identifier name
#157: FILE: arch/arm/include/asm/hardware/icst307.h:40:
+	void				(*setvco)(struct clk_icst307 *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
