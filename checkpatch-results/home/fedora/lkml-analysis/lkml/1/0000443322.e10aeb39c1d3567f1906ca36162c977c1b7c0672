WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#44: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:363:
+			 struct seq_operations *seq_ops)

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
