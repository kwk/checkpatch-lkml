WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#50: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .10
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#292: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2290:
+				if ((!(vc->vc_utf && !vc->vc_disp_ctrl) && c < 128) && !(c & ~charmask)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#542: FILE: drivers/media/video/tvaudio.c:196:

+					"Tried to access a non-existent register: %d\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#675: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-rx.c:255:
+		rxb->skb = alloc_skb(priv->hw_params.rx_buf_size + 256,
 				__GFP_NOWARN | GFP_ATOMIC);

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('
#685: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-rx.c:269:
+		rxb->real_dma_addr = pci_map_single(

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#691: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-rx.c:275:
+		BUG_ON(rxb->real_dma_addr & ~DMA_BIT_MASK(36));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#739: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-sta.c:624:
+	WARN(priv->stations[sta_id].sta.key.key_offset == WEP_INVALID_OFFSET,
+		"no space for new kew");

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#1004: FILE: drivers/video/macfb.c:978:
+	printk("fb%d: %s frame buffer device\n",

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#1026: FILE: include/asm-x86/vmi.h:228:
+extern void vmi_activate(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#1060: FILE: kernel/sched_clock.c:121:
+^I * ^I^I      max(scd->tick_gtod, scd->clock),$

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#1061: FILE: kernel/sched_clock.c:122:
+^I * ^I^I      scd->tick_gtod + TICK_NSEC);$

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Constistency' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Consistency'?
#1145: FILE: net/can/af_can.c:346:
+ *  Constistency checked mask.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#1188: FILE: net/can/af_can.c:382:
+	if (((*mask & CAN_EFF_RTR_FLAGS) == CAN_EFF_RTR_FLAGS)
+	    && !(*can_id & CAN_RTR_FLAG)) {

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#1189: FILE: net/can/af_can.c:383:
+	    && !(*can_id & CAN_RTR_FLAG)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'id' may be better as '(id)' to avoid precedence issues
#1227: FILE: net/can/bcm.c:67:
+#define REGMASK(id) ((id & CAN_EFF_FLAG) ? \
+		     (CAN_EFF_MASK | CAN_EFF_FLAG | CAN_RTR_FLAG) : \
+		     (CAN_SFF_MASK | CAN_EFF_FLAG | CAN_RTR_FLAG))

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
