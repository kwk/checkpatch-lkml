CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: fs/cifs/cifsproto.h:105:
+extern void cifs_put_tcp_session(struct TCP_Server_Info *server);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#201: FILE: fs/cifs/connect.c:1365:
+	struct sockaddr_in *addr4 = (struct sockaddr_in *) addr;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'addr4->sin_addr.s_addr !=
 		     server->addr.sockAddr.sin_addr.s_addr'

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#422: FILE: fs/cifs/connect.c:2236:
+				else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
