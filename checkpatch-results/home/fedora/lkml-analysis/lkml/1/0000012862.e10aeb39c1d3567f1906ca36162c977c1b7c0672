ERROR:DATE_TIME: Use of the '__DATE__' macro makes the build non-deterministic
#59: FILE: drivers/staging/hv/VersionInfo.h:27:
+static const char hv_build_date[] = __DATE__;

It is generally desirable that building the same source code with
the same set of tools is reproducible, i.e. the output is always
exactly the same.

The kernel does *not* use the ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros,
and enables warnings if they are used as they can lead to
non-deterministic builds.
