CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*cs)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct IsdnCardState)...)

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {
