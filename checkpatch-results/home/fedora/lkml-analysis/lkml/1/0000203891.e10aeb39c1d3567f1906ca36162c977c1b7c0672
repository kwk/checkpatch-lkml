CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!up"
#98: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1484:
+		if (up == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#101: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1487:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#102: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1488:

+					"irq%d\n", irq);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'occured' may be misspelled - perhaps 'occurred'?
#118: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1508:
+			 * interrupt meaning an LCR write attempt occured
 			                                          ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#121: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1511:
+			 * (USR) and re-writing the LCR. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#162: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1546:
+		BUG_ON(p == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p"
#162: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1546:
+		BUG_ON(p == NULL);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#179: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1562:
+	up->next = head = i->head;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#208: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1583:
+	if (i->head == NULL);
 		free_irq(up->port.irq, i);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#208: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1583:
+	if (i->head == NULL);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!i->head"
#208: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1583:
