Today, if  a  TCP server run with a SMACK non-ambient label, it will send labeled packets back to the client,

that's because "smack_socket_post_create" hook set labeled CIPSO packets unconditionnally

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sock->sk"
#81: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:1586:
+	if (sock->sk == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#85: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:1590:
+	/* sockets can listen on both IPv4 & IPv6,
+	   and fallback to V4 if client is V4 */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
