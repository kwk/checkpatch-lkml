WARNING:UNKNOWN_COMMIT_ID: Unknown commit id 'c5279dee26c0e8d7c4200993bfc4b540d2469598', maybe rebased or not pulled?
#44: 
commit c5279dee26c0e8d7c4200993bfc4b540d2469598 upstream.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#91: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:1001:
+	/* fall through */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#97: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:1004:
+	 * which require early EC, but fail to provide ECDT */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#99: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:1006:
+	acpi_handle x;
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG PREFIX "Look up EC in DSDT\n");

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
