WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#94: FILE: include/linux/dma-attrs.h:1:
+#ifndef _DMA_ATTR_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!attrs"
#139: FILE: include/linux/dma-attrs.h:46:
+	if (attrs == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#141: FILE: include/linux/dma-attrs.h:48:
+	BUG_ON(attr >= DMA_ATTR_MAX);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
