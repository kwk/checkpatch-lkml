Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#484: FILE: drivers/base/power/runtime.c:201:

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
