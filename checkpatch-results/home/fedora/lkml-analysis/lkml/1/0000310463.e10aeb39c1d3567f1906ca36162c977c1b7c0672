description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!uvd->dev"
#42: FILE: drivers/media/video/usbvideo/usbvideo.c:1037:
+	if (uvd->dev == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#43: FILE: drivers/media/video/usbvideo/usbvideo.c:1038:
+		err("%s: uvd->dev == NULL", __FUNCTION__);

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxO)
#46: FILE: drivers/media/video/usbvideo/usbvideo.c:1041:
+	uvd->vdev.dev=&(uvd->dev->dev);
 	             ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before that '&' (ctx:OxV)
#46: FILE: drivers/media/video/usbvideo/usbvideo.c:1041:
+	uvd->vdev.dev=&(uvd->dev->dev);
 	              ^

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around uvd->dev->dev
#46: FILE: drivers/media/video/usbvideo/usbvideo.c:1041:
+	uvd->vdev.dev=&(uvd->dev->dev);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
