CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: fs/proc/internal.h:35:
+extern void get_vmalloc_info(struct vmalloc_info *vmi, int lock);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'vmi' - possible side-effects?

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct sysinfo *' should also have an identifier name
#203: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:315:
+extern void __si_swapinfo(struct sysinfo *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

#259: FILE: kernel/kallsyms.c:523:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
