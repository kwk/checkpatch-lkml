CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#66: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:5435:
+				if (rdev->raid_disk >= conf->previous_raid_disks) {
[...]
+					added_devices++;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#70: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:5438:
+				} else

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#82: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:5453:
+	 * devices.*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
