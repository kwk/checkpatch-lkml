#49: 
This is a backported version of my similiar change for 2.6.33-rc6
                                   ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#99: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:107:
+		iattrs->ia_atime = timespec_trunc(iattr->ia_atime,
+			inode->i_sb->s_time_gran);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#102: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:110:
+		iattrs->ia_mtime = timespec_trunc(iattr->ia_mtime,
+			inode->i_sb->s_time_gran);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#105: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:113:
+		iattrs->ia_ctime = timespec_trunc(iattr->ia_ctime,
+			inode->i_sb->s_time_gran);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#111: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:119:
+		iattrs->ia_mode = sd->s_mode = mode;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
