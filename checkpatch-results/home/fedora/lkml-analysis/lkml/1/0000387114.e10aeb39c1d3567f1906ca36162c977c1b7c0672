CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:829:
+extern int pci_dma_flags_set_dmaflush(int dir);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#49: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:831:
+static inline int pci_dma_flags_set_dmaflush(int dir) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#50: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:832:
+	return (dir);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
