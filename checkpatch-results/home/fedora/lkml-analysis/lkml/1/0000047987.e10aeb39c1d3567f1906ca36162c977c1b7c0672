ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct input_handler *' should also have an identifier name
#425: FILE: include/linux/input.h:1301:
+int input_handler_for_each_handle(struct input_handler *, void *data,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
