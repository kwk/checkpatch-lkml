CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!amd_iommu_rlookup_table[devid]"
#76: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:135:
+	if (amd_iommu_rlookup_table[devid] == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#160: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:2092:
 	while ((dev = pci_get_device(PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, dev)) != NULL) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
