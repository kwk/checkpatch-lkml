WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 122 exceeds 100 columns
#49: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c:3981:
+static void nfs4_handle_setlk_error(struct nfs_server *server, struct nfs4_lock_state *lsp, int new_lock_owner, int error)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
