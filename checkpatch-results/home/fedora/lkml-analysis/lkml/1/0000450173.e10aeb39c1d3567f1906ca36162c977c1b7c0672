ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#62: FILE: fs/pollfs/signal.c:27:

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
