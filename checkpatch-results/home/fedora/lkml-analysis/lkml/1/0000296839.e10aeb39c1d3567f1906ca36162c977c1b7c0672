WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#77: FILE: net/rfkill/rfkill.c:54:
+#define RFKILL_RADIO_DEFAULT(__type) \
+	module_param_named(default_##__type##_state, \
+			   rfkill_default_state_##__type, uint, 0444); \
+	MODULE_PARM_DESC(default_##__type##_state, \
+			 "Override initial state for radios of type " \
+			 #__type ", 0 = radio off");

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#102: FILE: net/rfkill/rfkill.c:518:
+	if (state == UINT_MAX)
[...]
+	else if (state == RFKILL_STATE_OFF || state == RFKILL_STATE_ON) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
