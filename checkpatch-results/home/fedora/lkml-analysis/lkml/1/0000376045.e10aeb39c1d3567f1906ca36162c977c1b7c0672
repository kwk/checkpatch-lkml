CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!new"
#80: FILE: arch/um/drivers/net_kern.c:62:
+	if (new == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#95: FILE: arch/um/drivers/net_kern.c:77:
+int npackets = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open brace '{'
#104: FILE: arch/um/drivers/net_kern.c:87:
+	if ((++npackets % 100) == 0){

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
