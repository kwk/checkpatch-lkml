WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#21: 
Subject: [tip:tracing/ftrace] tracing: fix four sparse warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.
