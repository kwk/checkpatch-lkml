WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#51: FILE: arch/um/drivers/vde_user.c:83:
+		printk(UM_KERN_ERR "vde_init_libstuff - vde_open_args "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'vde_init_libstuff', this function's name, in a string
#51: FILE: arch/um/drivers/vde_user.c:83:
+		printk(UM_KERN_ERR "vde_init_libstuff - vde_open_args "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:OOM_MESSAGE: Possible unnecessary 'out of memory' message
