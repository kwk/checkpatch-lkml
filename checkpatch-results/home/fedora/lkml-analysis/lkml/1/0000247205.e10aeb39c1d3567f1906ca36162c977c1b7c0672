CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#63: FILE: drivers/block/cciss_scsi.c:383:
+	bus = target = -1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#91: FILE: drivers/block/cciss_scsi.c:411:
+		if (find_bus_target_lun(ctlr,
+			&sd->bus, &sd->target, &sd->lun) != 0)
