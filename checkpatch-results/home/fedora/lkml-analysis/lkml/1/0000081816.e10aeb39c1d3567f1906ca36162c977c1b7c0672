CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "strstr"
#98: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/early_printk.c:200:
+	keep = (strstr(buf, "keep") != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <orig_video_isVGA>
#110: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/early_printk.c:212:
+		    boot_params.screen_info.orig_video_isVGA == 1) {

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
