ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo 		* bar" should be "foo 		*bar"
#43: FILE: include/linux/device.h:129:
+	const char 		* mod_name;	/* used for built-in modules */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#110: FILE: kernel/module.c:2352:
+	if (mod)
[...]
+	else if (drv->mod_name) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
