WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#122: FILE: include/linux/ioq.h:35:
+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ioq_notifier *' should also have an identifier name
#209: FILE: include/linux/ioq.h:122:
+	void (*signal)(struct ioq_notifier *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#230: FILE: include/linux/ioq.h:143:

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#577: FILE: lib/ioq.c:36:
+	BUG_ON(pos >= ioq->count);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'idx->head == idx->tail'

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
