#32: 
free_arg_pages() is used to clean the pages allocated by copy_strings_kenrel().

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/linux/binfmts.h:99:
+extern void free_arg_pages(struct linux_binprm *bprm);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#77: FILE: fs/exec.c:330:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(free_arg_pages);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
