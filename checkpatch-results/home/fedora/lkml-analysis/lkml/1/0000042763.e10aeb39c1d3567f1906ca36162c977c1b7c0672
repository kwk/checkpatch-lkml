CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1726:
+extern void task_times(struct task_struct *p, cputime_t *ut, cputime_t *st);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#151: FILE: kernel/sched.c:5188:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#170: FILE: kernel/sched.c:5206:
+	cputime_t utime;
+	task_times(p, &utime, NULL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
