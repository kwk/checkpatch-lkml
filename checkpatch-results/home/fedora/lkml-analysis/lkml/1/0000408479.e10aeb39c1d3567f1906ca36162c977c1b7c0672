WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 144 exceeds 100 columns
#43: FILE: drivers/net/pcmcia/pcnet_cs.c:1580:
+       PCMCIA_DEVICE_PROD_ID1234("Socket", "CF 10/100 Ethernet Card", "Revision B", "05/11/06", 0xb38bcc2e, 0x4de88352, 0xeaca6c8d, 0x7e57c22e),

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
