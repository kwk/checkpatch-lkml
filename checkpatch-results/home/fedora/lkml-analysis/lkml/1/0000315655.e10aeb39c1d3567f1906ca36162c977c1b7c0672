#32: 
After the previous patch security_task_kill() is always called with secid == 0.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: include/linux/security.h:66:
+extern int cap_task_kill(struct task_struct *p, struct siginfo *info, int sig);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#70: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1344:
+			  struct siginfo * info, int sig);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
