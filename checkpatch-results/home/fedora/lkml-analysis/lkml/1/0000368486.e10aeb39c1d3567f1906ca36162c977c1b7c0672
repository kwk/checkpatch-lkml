CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#168: FILE: include/linux/bootmem.h:69:
+#define BOOTMEM_EXCLUSIVE	(1<<0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#177: FILE: include/linux/bootmem.h:77:
+extern int reserve_bootmem(unsigned long addr, unsigned long size, int flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
