CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:499:
+extern void perf_counter_mmap(unsigned long addr, unsigned long len,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
