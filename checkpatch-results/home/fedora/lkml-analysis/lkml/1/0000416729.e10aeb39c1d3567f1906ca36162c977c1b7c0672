CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: include/linux/compaction.h:11:
+extern int fragmentation_index(struct zone *zone, unsigned int target_order);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
