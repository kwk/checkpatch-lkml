ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#65: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:40:
+static struct tracer no_tracer __read_mostly =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#106: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2450:
+	val = simple_strtoul(buf, NULL, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#117: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2461:
+		pr_info("ftrace: set current_tracer to none"
+			" before modifying buffer size\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#150: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2512:
+static struct file_operations tracing_entries_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
