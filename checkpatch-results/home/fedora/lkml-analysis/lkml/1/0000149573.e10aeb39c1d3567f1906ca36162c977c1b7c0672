WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#128: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1069:
+	BUG_ON(cmd != REQ_IDETAPE_READ && cmd != REQ_IDETAPE_WRITE);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
