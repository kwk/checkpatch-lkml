Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pci_raw_ops should normally be const
#50: FILE: arch/x86/pci/direct.c:79:
+static struct pci_raw_ops pci_direct_conf1 = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#249: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:1055:
+extern void __init pci_mmcfg_early_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
