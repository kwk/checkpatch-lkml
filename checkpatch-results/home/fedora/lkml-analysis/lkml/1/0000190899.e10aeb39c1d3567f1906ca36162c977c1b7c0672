WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct skb_shared_info *' should also have an identifier name
#107: FILE: include/linux/skbuff.h:154:
+	void		(*destructor)(struct skb_shared_info *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#153: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:330:
+			int i;
+			for (i = 0; i < shinfo->nr_frags; i++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
