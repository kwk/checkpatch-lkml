#32: 
I have checked the Makefile to ensure that ks0108 was being called before than cfag12864b at boot, still, I'm not sure and I don't know if this will prevent the crash if ks0108 fails to init.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
