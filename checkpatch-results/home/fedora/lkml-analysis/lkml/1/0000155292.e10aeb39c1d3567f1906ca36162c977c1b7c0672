> Implement a new syscall which clone a thread with a preselected pid number.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 118 exceeds 100 columns
#450: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1436:
+extern long do_fork(unsigned long, unsigned long, struct pt_regs *, unsigned long, int __user *, int __user *, pid_t);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#450: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1436:
+extern long do_fork(unsigned long, unsigned long, struct pt_regs *, unsigned long, int __user *, int __user *, pid_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#450: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1436:
+extern long do_fork(unsigned long, unsigned long, struct pt_regs *, unsigned long, int __user *, int __user *, pid_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
