WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#58: FILE: drivers/rapidio/Kconfig:12:
+config RAPIDIO_PROC_FS
+	bool "I/O and Memory resource debug"
+	depends on RAPIDIO && PROC_FS
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  Enable this option, it will create a /proc/riores node for
+	  monitoring the RapidIO I/O and Memory resource.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#105: FILE: drivers/rapidio/rio.c:898:
+	if (p->sibling)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
