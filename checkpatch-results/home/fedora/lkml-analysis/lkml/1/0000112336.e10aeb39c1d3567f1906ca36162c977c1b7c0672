ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#41: 
--- a/fs/Kconfig	2009-06-10 05:05:27 +0200

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#47: FILE: fs/Kconfig:42:
+source "fs/xfs/Kconfig"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
