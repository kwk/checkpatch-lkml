CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/linux/bootmem.h:15:
+extern void update_end_of_memory_vars(u64 start, u64 size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#125: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:18:
+++ b/mm/memory_hotplug.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
