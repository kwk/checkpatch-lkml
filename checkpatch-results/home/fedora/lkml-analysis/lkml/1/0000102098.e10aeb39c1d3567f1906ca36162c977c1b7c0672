WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#174: 
#-of-thread x 32pages isolation.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'couse' may be misspelled - perhaps 'course'?
