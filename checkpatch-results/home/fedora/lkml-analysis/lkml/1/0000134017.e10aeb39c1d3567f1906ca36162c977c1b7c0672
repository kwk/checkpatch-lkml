CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/io.h:134:
+extern void iounmap(void *addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#84: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/io.h:136:
+/*extern void *__ioremap(phys_addr_t address, unsigned long size,
+		unsigned long flags);*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
