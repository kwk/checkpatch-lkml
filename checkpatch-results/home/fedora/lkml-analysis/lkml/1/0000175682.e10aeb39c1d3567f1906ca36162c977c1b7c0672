defined in board file. It is developed for pxa, however it is probably generic

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#50: FILE: drivers/leds/Kconfig:174:
+config LEDS_PWM

 comment "LED Triggers"
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#72: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*leds_data)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct led_pwm_data)...)

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.
