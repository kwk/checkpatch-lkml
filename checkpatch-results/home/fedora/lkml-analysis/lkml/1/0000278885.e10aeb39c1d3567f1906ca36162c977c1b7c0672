The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#69: FILE: fs/fcntl.c:235:
+		int on = !!(arg & FASYNC);
+		if (filp->f_op && filp->f_op->unlocked_fasync)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#69: FILE: fs/fcntl.c:235:
+		if (filp->f_op && filp->f_op->unlocked_fasync)
[...]
+		else if (filp->f_op && filp->f_op->fasync) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#144: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1240:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#144: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1240:
+	int (*unlocked_fasync) (int, struct file *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
