CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#113: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/amso1100/c2.h:522:
+extern int c2_arm_cq(struct ib_cq *ibcq, enum ib_cq_notify_flags flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
