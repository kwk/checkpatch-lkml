The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#212: FILE: arch/m68knommu/platform/coldfire/timers.c:16:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

#239: FILE: arch/m68knommu/platform/coldfire/timers.c:43:
+extern void mcf_settimericr(int timer, int level);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
