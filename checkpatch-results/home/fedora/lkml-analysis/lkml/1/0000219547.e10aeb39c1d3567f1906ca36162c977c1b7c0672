WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

+		unsigned rand;

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#140: FILE: net/ipv4/udp.c:166:
+		snum = first = rand % remaining + low;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
