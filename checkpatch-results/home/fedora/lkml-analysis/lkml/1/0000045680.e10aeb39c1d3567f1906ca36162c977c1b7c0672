WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'make_request', this function's name, in a string
#82: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:2888:
+	PRINTK("make_request on %llu, %s\n", bi->bi_sector,

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#95: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:3020:
+					PRINTK("SYNCRAID on %llu, already "
+					       "resynced\n", bi->bi_sector);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
