ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxV)

 	                                ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#107: FILE: net/ipv4/sysctl_net_ipv4.c:585:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I * to avoid possible corner-case series of spurious retransmissions $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#153: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:2455:
+	 * Use only if there are no unsent data. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sk->sk_send_head"
#156: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:2458:
+	    tcp_is_sack(tp) && sk->sk_send_head == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
