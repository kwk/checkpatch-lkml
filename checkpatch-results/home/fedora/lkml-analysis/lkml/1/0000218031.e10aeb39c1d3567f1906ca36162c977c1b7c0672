Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#162: FILE: include/linux/stacktrace.h:23:
+extern void save_stack_trace_user(struct stack_trace *trace);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
