CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#631: FILE: arch/sparc/include/asm/smp_64.h:38:
+extern void arch_send_call_function_ipi_mask(const struct cpumask *mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#648: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/smp_64.c:813:
+	xcall_deliver((u64) &xcall_call_function, 0, 0, mask);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
