CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "tty->ldisc.ops->write_wakeup"
#62: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:366:
+	   (tty->ldisc.ops->write_wakeup != NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around function pointer (tty->ldisc.ops->write_wakeup)
#63: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:367:
+		(tty->ldisc.ops->write_wakeup)(tty);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
