#44: 
makes ide-tape allocate single continous buffer.  The maximum order is
                               ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bh"
#152: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:343:
+		if (bh == NULL || bcount > bh->b_size) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*bh)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct idetape_bh)...)
#275: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:832:
+	bh = kmalloc(sizeof(struct idetape_bh), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
