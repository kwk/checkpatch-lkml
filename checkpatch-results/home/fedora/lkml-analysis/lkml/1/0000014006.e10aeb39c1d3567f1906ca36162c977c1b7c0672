WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#14: 
Subject: Re: [PATCH] scripts/checkpatch.pl: Dramatically improve #define

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#85: 
--- a/drivers/char/mem.c~drivers-char-memc-cleanups-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
