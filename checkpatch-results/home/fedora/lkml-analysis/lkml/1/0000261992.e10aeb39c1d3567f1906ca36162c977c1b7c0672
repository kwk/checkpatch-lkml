CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*edac_pci_top_main_kobj)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct kobject)...)
#116: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_pci_sysfs.c:373:
+	edac_pci_top_main_kobj = kzalloc(sizeof(struct kobject), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
