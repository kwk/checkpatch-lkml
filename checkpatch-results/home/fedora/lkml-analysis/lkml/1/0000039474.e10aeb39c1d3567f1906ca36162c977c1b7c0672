#37: 
This patch implements rudimentary module-loading support for cgroups - namely,

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:41:
+extern int cgroup_load_subsys(struct cgroup_subsys *ss);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#115: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:3658:
+	 * need to register a subsys_id, among other things */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#116: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:3659:
+	BUG_ON(ss->module);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
