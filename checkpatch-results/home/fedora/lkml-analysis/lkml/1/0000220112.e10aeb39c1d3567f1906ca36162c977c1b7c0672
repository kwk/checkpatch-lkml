#51: FILE: drivers/leds/Kconfig:202:
+config LEDS_TRIGGER_BACKLIGHT
+	tristate "LED backlight Trigger"
+	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
+	help
+	  This allows LEDs to be controlled as a backlight device: they

+	  If unsure, say N.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#74: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#79: FILE: drivers/leds/ledtrig-backlight.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*n)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct bl_trig_notifier)...)
#139: FILE: drivers/leds/ledtrig-backlight.c:61:
+	n = kzalloc(sizeof(struct bl_trig_notifier), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory
