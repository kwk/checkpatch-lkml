CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#98: FILE: include/linux/dma-mapping.h:63:
+extern int dma_set_mask_weak(struct device *dev, u64 *mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#102: FILE: include/linux/dma-mapping.h:67:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
