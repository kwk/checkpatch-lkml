WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#125: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/scsiglue.c:202:
+		 * capacity will be decremented or is correct. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#192: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/transport.c:560:
+	if (srb->result == SAM_STAT_GOOD && scsi_get_resid(srb) == 0) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
