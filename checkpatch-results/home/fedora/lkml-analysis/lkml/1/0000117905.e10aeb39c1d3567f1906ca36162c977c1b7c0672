#30: 
Introduce the new "struct ptrace_context" and add the pointer to task_struct.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/linux/ptrace.h:85:
+extern int alloc_ptrace_context(struct task_struct *child);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#90: FILE: include/linux/tracehook.h:260:
+static inline int tracehook_init_task(struct task_struct *task,
+					unsigned long clone_flags, int trace)
