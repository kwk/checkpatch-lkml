#27: 
Add initialization of an array, which needs brackets that would pollute kernel

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#45: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:424:
+#define INIT_ARRAY(type, val, len) ((type [len]) { [0 ... (len)-1] = (val) })

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
