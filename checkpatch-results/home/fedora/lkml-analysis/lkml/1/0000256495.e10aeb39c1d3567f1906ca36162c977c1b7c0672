WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#41: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#46: FILE: drivers/regulator/fixed.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct regulator_ops should normally be const
#92: FILE: drivers/regulator/fixed.c:47:
+static struct regulator_ops fixed_voltage_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*drvdata)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct fixed_voltage_data)...)
#104: FILE: drivers/regulator/fixed.c:59:
+	drvdata = kzalloc(sizeof(struct fixed_voltage_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!drvdata"
#105: FILE: drivers/regulator/fixed.c:60:
+	if (drvdata == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!drvdata->desc.name"
#111: FILE: drivers/regulator/fixed.c:66:
+	if (drvdata->desc.name == NULL) {

WARNING:SUSPECT_COMMA_SEMICOLON: Possible comma where semicolon could be used
#117: FILE: drivers/regulator/fixed.c:72:

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
