Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct sock *' should also have an identifier name
#147: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/svcsock.h:26:
+	void			(*sk_owspace)(struct sock *, unsigned int bias);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#169: FILE: include/net/sock.h:557:
+extern void sk_stream_write_space(struct sock *sk, unsigned int bias);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#177: FILE: include/net/sock.h:1436:
+static inline int sock_writeable_bias(const struct sock *sk, unsigned int bias) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
