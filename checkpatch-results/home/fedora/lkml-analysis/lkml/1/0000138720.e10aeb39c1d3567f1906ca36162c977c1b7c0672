Subject: [PATCH] block/genhd.c: fix sparse warning

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
