CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#121: FILE: include/linux/mmc/host.h:98:
+#define MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL	(1 << 6)	/* Needs polling for card-detection */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
