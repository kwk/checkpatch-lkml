CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <PageAnon>
#69: FILE: mm/memory.c:493:
+		rss[!!PageAnon(head_page)]++;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

 			if (unlikely(details) && details->nonlinear_vma
+			    && linear_page_index_mapping(details->nonlinear_vma,

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#120: FILE: mm/memory.c:690:
+^I^I^I^I^I   ^I(head_page->index << compound_page(order))$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#120: FILE: mm/memory.c:690:
+^I^I^I^I^I   ^I(head_page->index << compound_page(order))$

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#122: FILE: mm/memory.c:692:
+			if (PageAnon(head_page))
[...]
 			else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
