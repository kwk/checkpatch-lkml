#30: 
Updated patch. Might be good for someone who runs VMware to verify things still work though.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#51: 
--- a/arch/x86/kernel/setup.c	2009-02-08 15:37:27.000000000 -0500

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

distractions when editing files.
