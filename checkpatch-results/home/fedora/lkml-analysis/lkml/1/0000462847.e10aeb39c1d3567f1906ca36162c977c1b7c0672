#32: 
 - if the paravirt_op function is either NULL or native_nop, then patch nops

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#63: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:363:
+		BUG_ON(used > p->len);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::
