ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#120: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:127:
+static long n_rcu_torture_timers = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p"
#193: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:624:
+	if (p == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
