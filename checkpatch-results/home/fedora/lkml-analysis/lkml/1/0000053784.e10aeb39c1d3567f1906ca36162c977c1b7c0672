CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#116: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:1551:
+extern int tcp_cookie_generator(struct tcp_extend_values *xvp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#193: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp.c:2993:
+	if (unlikely(NULL == tcp_secret_primary)) {

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
