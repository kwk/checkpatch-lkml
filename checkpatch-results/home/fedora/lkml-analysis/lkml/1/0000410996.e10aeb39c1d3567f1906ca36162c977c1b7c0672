CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#128: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1324:
+struct page *shmem_zero_nopage(struct vm_area_struct *vma,
+				unsigned long address, int *type)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#149: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1345:
+			inode->i_ctime = inode->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#164: FILE: mm/shmem.c:2504:
+static struct vm_operations_struct shmem_zero_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
