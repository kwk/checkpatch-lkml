comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#961: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = -rc3-proc
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#1059: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:543:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "PDE '%s' already registered\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#1060: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:544:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "PDE '%s' already registered\n",
+				dp->name);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#1242: FILE: fs/proc/inode.c:40:
+		BUG_ON(atomic_read(&de->count) == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
