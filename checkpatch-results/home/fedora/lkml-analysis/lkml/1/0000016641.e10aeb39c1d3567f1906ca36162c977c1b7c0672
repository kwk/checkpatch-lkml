CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#117: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/asus-laptop.c:1141:
+	if (event >= ATKD_BR_MIN && event <= ATKD_BR_MAX) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "asus->backlight_device"
#119: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/asus-laptop.c:1143:
+		if (asus->backlight_device != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited before semicolon
#123: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/asus-laptop.c:1147:
+		return ;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
