Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SUPPORTED_10000baseT_Full>
#306: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/t3_hw.c:451:
+	 SUPPORTED_10000baseT_Full | SUPPORTED_AUI,

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#344: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/t3_hw.c:3209:
+	mc7->size = mc7->size = G_DEN(cfg) == M_DEN ? 0 : mc7_calc_size(cfg);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:MEMORY_BARRIER: memory barrier without comment
