CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#207: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-annotate.c:455:
+	sym_ext = priv->ext = calloc(len, sizeof(struct sym_ext));

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!he->sym"
#249: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-annotate.c:590:
+		if (he->sym == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!priv->hist"
#254: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-annotate.c:594:
+		if (priv->hist == NULL)

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#367: FILE: tools/perf/util/map.c:65:

+					"without symbols\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#455: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1336:
+	if (!dso) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
