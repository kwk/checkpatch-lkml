The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <eID>
#92: FILE: include/linux/ltt-core.h:40:
+typedef int (*ltt_run_filter_functor)(void *trace, uint16_t eID);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: include/linux/ltt-core.h:44:
+extern void ltt_filter_register(ltt_run_filter_functor func);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
