WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#102: FILE: net/wireless/wext.c:946:
+	if (IW_IS_SET(cmd)) {
[...]
-			/* Check NULL pointer */
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'iwp->length != 0'
#142: FILE: net/wireless/wext.c:960:
+	if (IW_IS_SET(cmd) && (iwp->length != 0)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#152: FILE: net/wireless/wext.c:968:
+	err = handler(dev, info, (union iwreq_data *) iwp, extra);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#190: FILE: net/wireless/wext.c:990:
