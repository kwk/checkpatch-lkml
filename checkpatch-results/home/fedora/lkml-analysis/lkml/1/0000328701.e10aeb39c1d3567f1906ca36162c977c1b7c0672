The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern void __pte_free_tlb(struct mmu_gather *tlb, struct page *pte);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
