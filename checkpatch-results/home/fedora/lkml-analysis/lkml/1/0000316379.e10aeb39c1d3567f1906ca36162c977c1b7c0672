WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns

+	{7, 5, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0}, /* ATA_100a (730 specific), differences are on cycle_time range and offset */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
