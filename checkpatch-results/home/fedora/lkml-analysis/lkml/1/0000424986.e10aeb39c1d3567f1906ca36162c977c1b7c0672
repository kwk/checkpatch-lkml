CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#354: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:3314:
+	if (!bio_barrier(bio) || count) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#367: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:3327:
+			char b[BDEVNAME_SIZE];
+			printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s(%d): %s block %Lu on %s\n",

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
