WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#97: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc.h:28:
+/* Should really implement gc for free page table pages. This could be
+   done with a reference count in struct page. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#101: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc.h:32:
+	BUG_ON((unsigned long)pte & (PAGE_SIZE-1));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#101: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc.h:32:
+	BUG_ON((unsigned long)pte & (PAGE_SIZE-1));
 	                                      ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#110: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc.h:41:
+extern void __pte_free_tlb(struct mmu_gather *tlb, struct page *pte);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
