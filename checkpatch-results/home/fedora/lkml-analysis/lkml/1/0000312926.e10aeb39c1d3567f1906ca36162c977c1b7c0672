Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 133 exceeds 100 columns
#234: FILE: kernel/auditsc.c:572:
+							if (security_audit_rule_match(axi->osid, f->type, f->op, f->lsm_rule, ctx)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#234: FILE: kernel/auditsc.c:572:
+							if (security_audit_rule_match(axi->osid, f->type, f->op, f->lsm_rule, ctx)) {

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
