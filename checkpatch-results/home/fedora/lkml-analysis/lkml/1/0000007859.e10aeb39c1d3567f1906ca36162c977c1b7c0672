CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#47: FILE: include/drm/ttm/ttm_bo_driver.h:911:
+extern pgprot_t ttm_io_prot(uint32_t caching_flags, pgprot_t tmp);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/drm/ttm/ttm_bo_driver.h:911:
+extern pgprot_t ttm_io_prot(uint32_t caching_flags, pgprot_t tmp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
