CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#54: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4_jbd2.h:164:
+#define EXT4_NOJOURNAL_MAX_REF_COUNT ((unsigned long) 4096)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPECAST_INT_CONSTANT: Unnecessary typecast of c90 int constant - '(unsigned long) 4096' could be '4096UL'

+#define EXT4_NOJOURNAL_MAX_REF_COUNT ((unsigned long) 4096)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#57: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4_jbd2.h:167:
+ * a properly allocated handle is using a journal or not. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#83: FILE: fs/ext4/super.c:192:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#90: FILE: fs/ext4/super.c:199:
+	BUG_ON(ref_cnt >= EXT4_NOJOURNAL_MAX_REF_COUNT);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
