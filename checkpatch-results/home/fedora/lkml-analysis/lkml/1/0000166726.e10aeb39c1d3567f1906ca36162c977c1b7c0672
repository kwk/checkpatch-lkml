CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/acpi.h> instead of <asm/acpi.h>
#61: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/fixmap_32.h:19:
+#include <asm/acpi.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#91: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/fixmap_32.h:49:
+#define FIXADDR_TOP	(VSYSCALL_END-PAGE_SIZE)
                    	             ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#194: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/fixmap_32.h:146:
+extern void reserve_top_address(unsigned long reserve);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
