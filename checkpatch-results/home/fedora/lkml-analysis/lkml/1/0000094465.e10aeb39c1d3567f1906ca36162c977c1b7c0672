#27: 
Add a missing iput when cleaning up if v9fs_get_inode
              ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#104: FILE: fs/9p/vfs_inode.c:226:
+	inode->i_atime = inode->i_mtime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
