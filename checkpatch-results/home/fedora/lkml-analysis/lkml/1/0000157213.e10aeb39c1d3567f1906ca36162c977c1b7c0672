WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'lazyness' may be misspelled - perhaps 'laziness'?
#71: FILE: drivers/crypto/ixp4xx_crypto.c:1040:

 	                                                        ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#71: FILE: drivers/crypto/ixp4xx_crypto.c:1040:
+	BUG_ON(req->src != req->dst); /* -ENOTSUP because of my lazyness */

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
