WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Incase' may be misspelled - perhaps 'In case'?
#121: FILE: fs/open.c:377:
+ * Note: Incase the file system does not support preallocation,
          ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#177: FILE: fs/open.c:433:
+		ret = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
