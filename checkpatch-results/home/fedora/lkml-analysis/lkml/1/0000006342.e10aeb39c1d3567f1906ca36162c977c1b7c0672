WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#37: 
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/workqueue

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#40: 
==== ==== ===== ================ ============ ===== ============================

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#105: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:293:
+extern void workqueue_set_show_work(struct workqueue_struct *wq,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#274: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:3203:
+	ITER_CPU_BITS		= order_base_2(NR_CPUS),

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#392: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:3321:
+	} else	/* bump up the index */

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: char * array declaration might be better as static const
#458: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:3387:
+	const char *units[] =	{ "us", "ms", " s", " m", " h", " d" };

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "worker"
#523: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:3452:
+		showed = wq->show_work(m, work, worker != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#577: FILE: lib/Kconfig.debug:1057:
+config WORKQUEUE_DEBUGFS
+	bool "Enable workqueue debugging info via debugfs"
+	depends on DEBUG_FS
+	help
+	  Enable debug FS support for workqueue.  Information about all the
+	  current workers and works is available through <debugfs>/workqueue.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
