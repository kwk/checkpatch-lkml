CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: include/linux/dma-debug.h:45:
+extern void debug_dma_alloc_coherent(struct device *dev, size_t size,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: include/linux/dma-debug.h:48:
+extern void debug_dma_free_coherent(struct device *dev, size_t size,

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!virt"
#92: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:640:
+	if (unlikely(virt == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#111: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:659:
+void debug_dma_free_coherent(struct device *dev, size_t size,
+			 void *virt, dma_addr_t addr)
