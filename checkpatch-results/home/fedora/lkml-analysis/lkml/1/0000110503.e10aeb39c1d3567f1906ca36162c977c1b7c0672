CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/uaccess.h:13:
+extern int _access_ok(unsigned long ptr, unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
