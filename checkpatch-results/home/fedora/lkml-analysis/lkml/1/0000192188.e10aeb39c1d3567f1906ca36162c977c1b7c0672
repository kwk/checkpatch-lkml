Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#78: 
# define lockdep_set_class(lock, key)		do { (void)(key); } while (0)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#84: 
--- a/kernel/irq/handle.c~irq-enclose-irq_desc_lock_class-in-config_lockdep

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
