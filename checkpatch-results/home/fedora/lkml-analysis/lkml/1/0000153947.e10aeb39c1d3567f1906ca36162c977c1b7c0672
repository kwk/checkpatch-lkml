CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: include/linux/dma-debug.h:31:
+extern void dma_debug_add_bus(struct bus_type *bus);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#100: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:422:
+static int dma_debug_device_change(struct notifier_block *nb,
+				    unsigned long action, void *data)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#105: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:427:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#112: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:434:
+		err_printk(dev, NULL, "DMA-API: device driver has pending "
+				"DMA allocations while released from device "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#113: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:435:
+				"DMA allocations while released from device "
+				"[count=%d]\n", count);

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*nb)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct notifier_block)...)
#126: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:448:
+	nb = kzalloc(sizeof(struct notifier_block), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!nb"
#127: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:449:
+	if (nb == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#128: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:450:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "dma_debug_add_bus: out of memory\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dma_debug_add_bus', this function's name, in a string
#128: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:450:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "dma_debug_add_bus: out of memory\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:OOM_MESSAGE: Possible unnecessary 'out of memory' message
#128: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:450:
+	if (nb == NULL) {
+		printk(KERN_ERR "dma_debug_add_bus: out of memory\n");
