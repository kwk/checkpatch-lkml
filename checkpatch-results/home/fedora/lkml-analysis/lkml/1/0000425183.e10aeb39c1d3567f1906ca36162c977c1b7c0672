I have also followed the Pavel's suggestion to limit the nubmer of events.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#131: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:112:
+static inline int register_pm_notifier(struct notifier_block *nb) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#139: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:120:
+#define pm_notifier(fn, pri)	do { (void)(fn); } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
