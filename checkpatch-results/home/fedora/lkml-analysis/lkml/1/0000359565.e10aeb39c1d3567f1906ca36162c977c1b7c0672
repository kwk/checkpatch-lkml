ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#79: FILE: include/linux/marker.h:56:
+ ^I^I= #name "\0" format;^I^I^I^I^I\$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Elf_Sym>
#160: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:1260:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#172: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:1272:
+	first_sym = last_sym = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!first_sym"
#179: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:1279:
+			if (first_sym == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#264: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:1750:
+			if (is_vmlinux(modname)) {
+				have_vmlinux = 1;
+			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
