CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#112: FILE: fs/namespace.c:1260:
+	res = q = clone_mnt(mnt, dentry, flag, owner);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct vfsmount *' should also have an identifier name
#235: FILE: fs/pnode.h:36:
+struct vfsmount *copy_tree(struct vfsmount *, struct dentry *, int, uid_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
