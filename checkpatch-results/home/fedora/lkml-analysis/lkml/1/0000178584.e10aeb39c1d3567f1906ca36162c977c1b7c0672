Subject: [PATCH] ide: use ide_pci_is_in_compatibility_mode() in ide_pci_init_{one,two}()

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#52: FILE: drivers/ide/setup-pci.c:571:
+	if (ide_pci_is_in_compatibility_mode(dev)) {
[...]
-	}
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#57: FILE: drivers/ide/setup-pci.c:575:
+		hw[1].irq = hw[0].irq = ret;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
