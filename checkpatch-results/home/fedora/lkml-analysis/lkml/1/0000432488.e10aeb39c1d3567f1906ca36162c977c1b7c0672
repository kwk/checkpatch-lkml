CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/string.h:108:
+extern char *kstrndup(const char *s, size_t len, gfp_t gfp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#100: FILE: mm/util.c:59:
+	buf = kmalloc_track_caller(len+1, gfp);
 	                              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#101: FILE: mm/util.c:60:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
