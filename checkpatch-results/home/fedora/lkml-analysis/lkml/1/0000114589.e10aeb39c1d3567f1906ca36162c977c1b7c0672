Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#83: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:24:
+			(__u64)start, (unsigned long)len, name, self->hist, (void *)(unsigned long)obj_start);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
