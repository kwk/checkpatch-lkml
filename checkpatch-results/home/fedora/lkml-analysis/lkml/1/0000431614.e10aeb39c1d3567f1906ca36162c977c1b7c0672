CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#192: FILE: fs/affs/affs.h:156:
+extern struct dentry *affs_lookup(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata2 *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct nameidata2 *' should also have an identifier name
#192: FILE: fs/affs/affs.h:156:
+extern struct dentry *affs_lookup(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata2 *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#195: FILE: fs/affs/affs.h:158:
+extern int	affs_create(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry, int mode, struct nameidata2 *);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#2394: FILE: include/linux/namei.h:22:
+#define __NAMEIDATA2				\
+	struct dentry	*dentry;		\
+	struct vfsmount *mnt;			\
+	unsigned int	flags;			\
+						\
+	union {					\
+		struct open_intent open;	\
+	} intent;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
