#16: 
Subject: [PATCH 041/148] include/asm-x86/hw_irq_64.h: checkpatch cleanups - formatting only

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#56: FILE: include/asm-x86/hw_irq_64.h:162:
+#define BUILD_IRQ(nr)				\
+	asmlinkage void IRQ_NAME(nr);		\
+	asm("\n.p2align\n"			\
+	    "IRQ" #nr "_interrupt:\n\t"		\
+	    "push $~(" #nr ") ; "		\
+	    "jmp common_interrupt");

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
