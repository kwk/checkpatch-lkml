CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/uv/bios.h:94:
+extern int uv_bios_mq_watchlist_alloc(unsigned long, unsigned int,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#77: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/uv/bios.h:94:
+extern int uv_bios_mq_watchlist_alloc(unsigned long, unsigned int,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#123: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xp_uv.c:51:
+	BUG_ON(!uv_gpa_in_mmr_space(src_gpa));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <xpSuccess>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "buf_base"
#170: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc_partition.c:100:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
