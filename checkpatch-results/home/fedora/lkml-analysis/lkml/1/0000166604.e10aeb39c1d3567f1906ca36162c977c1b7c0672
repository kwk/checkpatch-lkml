#46: 
memory cgroup soft limit reclaim finds the group that exceeds its soft limit

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:119:
+extern unsigned long mem_cgroup_soft_limit_reclaim(gfp_t gfp_mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#187: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:961:
+		if (check_soft) {

+		} else if (mem_cgroup_check_under_limit(root_mem))

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
