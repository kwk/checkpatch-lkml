ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#105: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/clock.c:49:
+static int omap_clk_for_each_child(struct clk *clk, unsigned long parent_rate,
+				   u8 rate_storage,
+				   int (*cb)(struct clk *clk,

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*child)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct clk_child)...)
#181: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/clock.c:125:
+			child = kmalloc(sizeof(struct clk_child), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#439: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/include/mach/clock.h:196:
+#define CLK_CHILD_SLAB_ALLOC	(1 << 0)	/* if !set, bootmem was used */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#440: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/include/mach/clock.h:197:
+#define CLK_CHILD_DELETED	(1 << 1)	/* can be reused */
