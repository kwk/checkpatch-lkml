CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:191:
+extern int __ratelimit(int ratelimit_jiffies, int ratelimit_burst);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#116: FILE: lib/ratelimit.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#140: FILE: lib/ratelimit.c:25:
+	static unsigned toks = 10 * 5 * HZ;

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#158: FILE: lib/ratelimit.c:43:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "__ratelimit: %d messages"

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '__ratelimit', this function's name, in a string
#158: FILE: lib/ratelimit.c:43:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "__ratelimit: %d messages"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#159: FILE: lib/ratelimit.c:44:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "__ratelimit: %d messages"
+				" suppressed.\n", lost);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
