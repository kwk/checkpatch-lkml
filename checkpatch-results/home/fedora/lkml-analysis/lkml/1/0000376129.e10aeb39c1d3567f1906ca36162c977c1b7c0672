WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#39: FILE: mm/dmapool.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#122: FILE: mm/dmapool.c:136:
+	if (size == 0) {
[...]
-
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#128: FILE: mm/dmapool.c:141:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#150: FILE: mm/dmapool.c:196:
+		unsigned int next = offset + pool->size;
+		if (unlikely((next + pool->size) >= pool->allocation))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#305: FILE: mm/dmapool.c:397:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dma_pool_free', this function's name, in a string
#311: FILE: mm/dmapool.c:403:
+				dev_err(pool->dev, "dma_pool_free %s, dma %Lx "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:PRINTF_L: %Lx is non-standard C, use %llx
#311: FILE: mm/dmapool.c:403:
+				dev_err(pool->dev, "dma_pool_free %s, dma %Lx "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#312: FILE: mm/dmapool.c:404:
+				dev_err(pool->dev, "dma_pool_free %s, dma %Lx "
+					"already free\n", pool->name,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
