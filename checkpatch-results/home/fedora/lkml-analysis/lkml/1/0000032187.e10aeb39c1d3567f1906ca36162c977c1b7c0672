WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#93: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#98: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/l4f00242t03.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'l4f00242t03_reset', this function's name, in a string
#132: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/l4f00242t03.c:35:
+	pr_debug("l4f00242t03_reset.\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pdata"
#215: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/l4f00242t03.c:118:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*priv)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct l4f00242t03_priv)...)
#220: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/l4f00242t03.c:123:
+	priv = kzalloc(sizeof(struct l4f00242t03_priv), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
