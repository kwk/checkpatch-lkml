WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'funtions' may be misspelled - perhaps 'functions'?

specific funtions and to be more meaningful.
         ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#76: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/8xx/m8xx_setup.c:246:
+void __init mpc8xx_pics_init(void)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#115: FILE: arch/powerpc/sysdev/commproc.h:9:
+extern void mpc8xx_pics_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
