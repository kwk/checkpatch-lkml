CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#93: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/alternative.h:164:
+extern void *text_poke_smp(void *addr, const void *opcode, size_t len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:MEMORY_BARRIER: memory barrier without comment
#136: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:580:
+			smp_rmb();
