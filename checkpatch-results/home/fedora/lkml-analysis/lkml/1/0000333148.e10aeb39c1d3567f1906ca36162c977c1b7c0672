WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#74: FILE: drivers/acpi/namespace/nsxfeval.c:511:
+			if (!found) {
+				return (AE_OK);
+			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#75: FILE: drivers/acpi/namespace/nsxfeval.c:512:
+				return (AE_OK);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
