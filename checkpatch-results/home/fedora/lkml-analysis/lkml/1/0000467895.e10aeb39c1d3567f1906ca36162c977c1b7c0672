Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#153: FILE: drivers/serial/of_serial.c:80:
+		/* fallthrough */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#178: FILE: drivers/serial/of_serial.c:105:
+	int line = (unsigned long)ofdev->dev.driver_data;
+	serial8250_unregister_port(line);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1377655732.3619.19.camel@joe-AO722/

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct of_device_id should normally be const
#185: FILE: drivers/serial/of_serial.c:112:
+static struct of_device_id __devinitdata of_platform_serial_table[] = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
