CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p->mapping != NULL'
#74: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:641:
+		if (unlikely(page_mapcount(p) |
+			(p->mapping != NULL)  |
+			(page_count(p) != 0)  |
+			(p->flags & PAGE_FLAGS_CHECK_AT_PREP))) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "p->mapping"
#75: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:642:
+			(p->mapping != NULL)  |

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
