CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: lib/tracing/tracer.h:125:
+extern int register_tracer_switch(struct tracer_switch_ops *ops);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#119: FILE: lib/tracing/trace_sched_switch.c:47:
+static struct tracer_switch_ops sched_switch_ops __read_mostly =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ops"
#136: FILE: lib/tracing/trace_sched_switch.c:64:
+	for (; ops != NULL; ops = ops->next)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
