WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#130: FILE: include/linux/ratelimit.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_RATELIMIT_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#143: FILE: include/linux/ratelimit.h:14:
+extern int __ratelimit(struct ratelimit_state *rs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#147: FILE: include/linux/ratelimit.h:18:
+	static struct ratelimit_state rs;
+	return __ratelimit(&rs);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
