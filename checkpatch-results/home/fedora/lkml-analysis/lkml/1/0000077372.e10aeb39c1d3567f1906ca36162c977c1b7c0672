WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#80: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#85: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c:1:
+/* linux/drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#85: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c:1:
+/* linux/drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dd)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct da8xx_drvdata)...)
#265: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c:181:
+	dd = kzalloc(sizeof(struct da8xx_drvdata), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dd"
#266: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c:182:
+	if (dd == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:OOM_MESSAGE: Possible unnecessary 'out of memory' message
#267: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c:183:
+	if (dd == NULL) {
+		dev_err(_dev, "no memory for private data\n");

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!res"
#272: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c:188:
+	if (res == NULL) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dd->io"
#281: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c:197:
+	if (dd->io == NULL) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dd->base"
#288: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c:204:
+	if (dd->base == NULL) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pp"
#310: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c:226:
+	if (pp == NULL) {

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#318: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_da8xx.c:234:
+	dd->dev = pp->dev = _dev;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
