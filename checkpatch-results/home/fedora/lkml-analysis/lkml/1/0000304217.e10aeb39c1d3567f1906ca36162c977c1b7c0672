#84: 
Adds rcu_barrier_sched, which uses call_rcu_sched. It wait for each in flight

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#101: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:263:
+extern void rcu_barrier_sched(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'rcu_barrier_sched', prefer 'rcu_barrier' instead
#101: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:263:
+extern void rcu_barrier_sched(void);

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.
