This patch provides the following hugetlb-related fixes to the recent stacked

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: include/linux/shm.h:99:
+extern int is_file_shm_hugepages(struct file *file);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+static inline int is_file_shm_hugepages(struct file *file)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#107: FILE: ipc/shm.c:290:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#107: FILE: ipc/shm.c:290:
+	int (*fsync) (struct file *, struct dentry *, int datasync);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dentry *' should also have an identifier name
#107: FILE: ipc/shm.c:290:
+	int (*fsync) (struct file *, struct dentry *, int datasync);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
