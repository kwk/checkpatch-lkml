#88: FILE: arch/i386/xen/enlighten.c:102:
+	BUG_ON(err != 0 && err != -ENOSYS);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#88: FILE: arch/i386/xen/enlighten.c:102:
+	BUG_ON(err != 0 && err != -ENOSYS);

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
