WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#48: FILE: drivers/kvm/x86_emulate.c:562:
+		c->modrm_rm = base_reg = (c->rex_prefix & 1) << 3; /* REG.B */

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <ByteOp>
#60: FILE: drivers/kvm/x86_emulate.c:574:
+			decode_register(c->modrm_rm, c->regs, c->d & ByteOp);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
