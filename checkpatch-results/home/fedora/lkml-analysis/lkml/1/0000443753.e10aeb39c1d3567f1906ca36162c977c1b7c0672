CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#150: FILE: fs/nfs/client.c:874:
+	error = nfs_create_rpc_client(clp, proto, timeo, retrans, authflavour,
+					RPC_CLNT_CREATE_DISCRTRY);

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#170: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/clnt.h:115:
+#define RPC_CLNT_CREATE_DISCRTRY	(1UL << 6)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#197: FILE: net/sunrpc/xprt.c:740:
+			 * then we must be retransmitting this one */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
