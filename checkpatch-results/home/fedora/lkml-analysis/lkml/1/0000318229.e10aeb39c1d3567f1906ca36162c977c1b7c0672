CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#138: FILE: include/net/sctp/sm.h:389:
+extern void sctp_add_cmd_sf(sctp_cmd_seq_t *seq, sctp_verb_t verb,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#168: FILE: net/sctp/command.c:76:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
