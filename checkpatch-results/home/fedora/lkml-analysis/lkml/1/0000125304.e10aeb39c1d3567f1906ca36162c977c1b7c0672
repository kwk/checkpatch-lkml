CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#76: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:298:
+#define MMLIST_SWAP (1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
