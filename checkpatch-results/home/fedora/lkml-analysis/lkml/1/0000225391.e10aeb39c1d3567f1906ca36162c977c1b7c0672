#26: 
Track which TLB entries need to be written, instead of overwriting everything

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/kvm_ppc.h:69:
+extern void kvmppc_tlbe_set_modified(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, unsigned int i);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
