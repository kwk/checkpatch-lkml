Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
