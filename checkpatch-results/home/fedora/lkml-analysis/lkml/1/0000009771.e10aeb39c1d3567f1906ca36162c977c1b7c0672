Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#113: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:1884:
+ * for flip events, e.g for the overlay support. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#125: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:1896:
+	BUG_ON(ret == -ERESTARTSYS);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
