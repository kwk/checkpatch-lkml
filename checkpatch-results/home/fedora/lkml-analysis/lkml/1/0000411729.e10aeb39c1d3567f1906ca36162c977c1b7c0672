#30: 
When the interface is down (or driver removed), the BroadCom 44xx card remains

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#71: FILE: drivers/net/b44.c:1314:
+		return;/* don't enable PHY if we are doing a partial reset
+		, we are probably going to power down */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
