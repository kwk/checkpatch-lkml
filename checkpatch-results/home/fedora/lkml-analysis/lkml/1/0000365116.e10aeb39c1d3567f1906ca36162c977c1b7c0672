WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#59: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#64: FILE: include/linux/stringbuf.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_STRINGBUF_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: include/linux/stringbuf.h:14:
+extern void sb_printf_append(struct stringbuf **sb,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __printf(3, 4) over __attribute__((format(printf, 3, 4)))
#79: FILE: include/linux/stringbuf.h:16:

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __aligned(__alignof__(struct stringbuf)) over __attribute__((aligned(__alignof__(struct stringbuf))))

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#118: FILE: lib/stringbuf.c:6:
+char enomem_string[] __attribute__((aligned(__alignof__(struct stringbuf))))
+	= "stringbuf: out of memory";

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
