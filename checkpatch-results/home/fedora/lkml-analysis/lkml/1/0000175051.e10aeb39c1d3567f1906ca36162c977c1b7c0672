CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#75: FILE: arch/arm/plat-s3c/clock.c:78:
+	if (dotpos) {
[...]
+	} else if (dev == NULL || dev->bus != &platform_bus_type)
[...]
 	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#76: FILE: arch/arm/plat-s3c/clock.c:79:
+		int err = strict_strtol(dotpos + 1, 10, &idno);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#77: FILE: arch/arm/plat-s3c/clock.c:80:
+		int err = strict_strtol(dotpos + 1, 10, &idno);
+		if (err)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (16, 32)
#77: FILE: arch/arm/plat-s3c/clock.c:80:
+		if (err)
+				return ERR_PTR(err);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev"
#81: FILE: arch/arm/plat-s3c/clock.c:84:
+	} else if (dev == NULL || dev->bus != &platform_bus_type)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#116: FILE: arch/arm/plat-s3c/clock.c:235:
+int clk_for_each(int(*fn)(struct clk *, void *), void *data)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
