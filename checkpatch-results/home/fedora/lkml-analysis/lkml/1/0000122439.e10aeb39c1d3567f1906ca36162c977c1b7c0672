#39: 
 o Change function name from setup_per_zone_wmark_min to setup_per_zone_wmarks

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1061:
+extern void setup_per_zone_wmarks(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#94: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:4474:
+ * setup_per_zone_wmarks - called when min_free_kbytes changes $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
