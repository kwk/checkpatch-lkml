CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <xpSuccess>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply

+	xpnet_broadcast_partitions = kzalloc(BITS_TO_LONGS(xp_max_npartitions) *

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!xpnet_broadcast_partitions"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
