WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#97: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/bkm_a8.c:273:
+static int __devinit

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#105: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/bkm_a8.c:279:
+	struct pci_dev *dev_a8 = (void *) card->para[1];

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#153: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/bkm_a8.c:289:
 	if (cs->subtyp == SCT_1) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#204: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/bkm_a8.c:409:
+static int __devinit a8_pci_init_one(struct pci_dev *pdev,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#205: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/bkm_a8.c:410:
+static int __devinit a8_pci_init_one(struct pci_dev *pdev,
+				      const struct pci_device_id *ent)

#207: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/bkm_a8.c:412:
+	struct IsdnCard icard = { ISDN_CTYPE_SCT_QUADRO, };

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#221: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/bkm_a8.c:426:

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#239: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/bkm_a8.c:444:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
