#67: 
So I upgraded my old counter patches a bit and can now report the following:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'availablity' may be misspelled - perhaps 'availability'?

                                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#280: FILE: include/linux/sysctl.h:71:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#338: FILE: mm/backing-dev.c:742:
+unsigned long perf_count_congestion_wait = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#366: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:265:
+extern unsigned long perf_count_call_congestion_wait_from_alloc_pages_high_priority;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
