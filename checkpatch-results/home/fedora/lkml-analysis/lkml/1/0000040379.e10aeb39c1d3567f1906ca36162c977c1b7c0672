WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+	struct clk *ck_uart = clk_get(NULL, "uart");
+	BUG_ON(IS_ERR(ck_uart));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#102: FILE: arch/arm/mach-w90x900/nuc932.c:88:
+	BUG_ON(IS_ERR(ck_uart));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: arch/arm/mach-w90x900/nuc932.h:29:
+extern void nuc932_init_uartclk(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
