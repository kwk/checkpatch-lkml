#31: 
when memory spread is set by updating tasks' mems_allowed after its cpuset's

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'anothers' may be misspelled - perhaps 'another'?
#36: 
originally. After applying this patch, one task directly manipulates anothers
                                                                     ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#121: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1304:
+ * mempolicy */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#482: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1846:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#520: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:184:
 }
+/*

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pol"
#533: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:197:
+	if (pol == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#557: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:220:
+ * initializtion. You must invoke mpol_new_mempolicy to set nodes */

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#754: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:2134:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#760: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:2140:
+		if (ret)
[...]
+		else if (no_context) {
