ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#81: FILE: mm/internal.h:49:
+static bool inline gfp_wait(gfp_t gfp_mask)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#84: FILE: mm/internal.h:52:

+	if (wait && !in_irq() && (current->flags & PF_MEM_NOWAIT))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
