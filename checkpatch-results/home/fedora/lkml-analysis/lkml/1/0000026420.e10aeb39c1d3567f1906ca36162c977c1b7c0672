WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#44: FILE: drivers/gpio/Kconfig:165:
+config GPIO_WM8350
+	tristate "WM8350 GPIOs"
+	depends on MFD_WM8350
+	help
+	  Say yes here to access the GPIO signals of WM8350 power management
+	  chips from Wolfson Microelectronics.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#64: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#69: FILE: drivers/gpio/wm8350-gpiolib.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.
