ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#119: FILE: kernel/time/timekeeping.c:494:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#119: FILE: kernel/time/timekeeping.c:494:
+ ^I * xtime_nsec is not as small.$

+		clock->xtime_nsec = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
