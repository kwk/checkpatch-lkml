CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.h:396:
+extern char *trace_find_cmdline(int pid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#145: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_boot.c:78:
+	sec = (unsigned long) it->calltime;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#147: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_boot.c:80:
+	ret = trace_seq_printf(s, "[%5lu.%09lu] calling  %s @ %i\n",
+				  sec, nsec_rem, it->func, it->caller);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#152: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_boot.c:85:
+	sec = (unsigned long) it->rettime;

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#155: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_boot.c:88:
+	ret = trace_seq_printf(s, "[%5lu.%09lu] initcall %s "
+				  "returned %d after %llu msecs\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
