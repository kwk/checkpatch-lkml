#89: 
   While testing these patches along with the bio-cgroup patches I noticed that for the case of 2 buffered writers (dd) with different weights, one of them would be able to use up a very large timeslice (I've seen upto 500ms) when the other queue is empty and not be accounted for it. This is due to the check in cfq_dispatch_requests() where  a given cgroup can empty its entire queue (100 IOs or more) within its timeslice and have them sit in the dispatch queue ready for the disk driver to pick up. Moreover, this huge timeslice is not accounted for as this cgroup is charged only for the length of the intended timeslice and not the actual time taken.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ^^^^
