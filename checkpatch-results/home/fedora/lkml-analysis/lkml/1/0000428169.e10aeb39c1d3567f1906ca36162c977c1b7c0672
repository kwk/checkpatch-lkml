CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#111: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:207:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#140: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:398:
+						if (print_task_stats)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#141: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:399:
+							print_taskstats((struct taskstats *) NLA_DATA(na));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#141: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:399:
+							print_taskstats((struct taskstats *) NLA_DATA(na));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#215: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/entry_32.S:205:
+#ifdef CONFIG_TASKSTATS $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#273: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:293:
 }
+static inline char *task_perf(struct task_struct *p, char *buffer)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
