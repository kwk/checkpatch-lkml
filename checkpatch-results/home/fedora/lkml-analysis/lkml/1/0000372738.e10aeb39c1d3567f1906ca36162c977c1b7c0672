CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#115: FILE: net/core/dev.c:3148:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent

+		case SIOCSIFFLAGS:	/* Set interface flags */
[...]
+		case SIOCSIFMETRIC:	/* Set the metric on the interface
[...]
+		case SIOCSIFMTU:	/* Set the MTU of a device */

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#135: FILE: net/core/dev.c:3168:
+		case SIOCSIFMETRIC:	/* Set the metric on the interface
+					   (currently unused) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
