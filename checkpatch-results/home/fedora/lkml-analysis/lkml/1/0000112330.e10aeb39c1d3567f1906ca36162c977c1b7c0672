WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#75: 
The futex codes seem complicated. We could work out cleanup patches later after

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#91: FILE: kernel/futex.c:308:
+	struct vm_area_struct * vma;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#103: FILE: kernel/futex.c:320:
+		int fault;
+		fault = handle_mm_fault(mm, vma, address, 1);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
