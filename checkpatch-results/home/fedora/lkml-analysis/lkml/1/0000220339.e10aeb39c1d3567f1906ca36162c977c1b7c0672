    * which sets new->event_handler using the old->event_handler which is noop.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:130:
+extern void clockevents_handle_noop(struct clock_event_device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
