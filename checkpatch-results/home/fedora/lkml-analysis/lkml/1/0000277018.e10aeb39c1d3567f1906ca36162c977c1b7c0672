WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#57: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/adapter.h:121:
+	unsigned int rx_recycle_buf; /* whether recycling occurred

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#149: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:773:
+	newskb = skb = q->pg_skb;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'len <= SGE_RX_COPY_THRES'
#151: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:775:
+	if (!skb && (len <= SGE_RX_COPY_THRES)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "newskb"
#153: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:777:
+		if (likely(newskb != NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

#179: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:799:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
