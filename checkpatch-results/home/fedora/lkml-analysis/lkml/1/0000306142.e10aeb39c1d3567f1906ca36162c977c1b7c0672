CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Dprintk>
#57: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot_32.c:858:
+		Dprintk("do_boot_cpu %d Already started\n", cpu);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#58: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot_32.c:859:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
