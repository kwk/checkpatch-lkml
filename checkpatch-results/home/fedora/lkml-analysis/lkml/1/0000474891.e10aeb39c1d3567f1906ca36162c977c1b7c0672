WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#47: FILE: scripts/makelst:7:
+#	$(srctree)/scripts/makelst $*.o $(srctree)/System.map $(OBJDUMP)

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
