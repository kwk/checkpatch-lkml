#39: 
This is the third version of the patch in which I cleaned up and fixed quite some stuff according to feedback from Ted.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
