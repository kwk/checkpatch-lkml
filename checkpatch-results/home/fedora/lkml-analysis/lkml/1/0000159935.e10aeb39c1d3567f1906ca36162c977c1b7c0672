WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config PAGE_POISONING

+	select DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
+	help
+	   Fill the pages with poison patterns after free_pages() and verify
+	   the patterns before alloc_pages(). This results in a large slowdown,
+	   but helps to find certain types of memory corruptions.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
