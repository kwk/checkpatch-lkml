WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#45: 
#define TS_RNG		(TS78XX_FPGA_REGS_VIRT_BASE | 0x044)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#79: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/Kconfig:23:
+config HW_RANDOM_TIMERIOMEM
+	tristate "Timer IOMEM HW Random Number Generator support"
+	depends on HW_RANDOM
+	---help---
+	  This driver provides kernel-side support for a generic Random
+	  Number Generator provisioned by hardware through a 'dumb' iomem
+	  address; for example the TS-7800 is such a device.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called timeriomem-rng.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#108: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#113: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/timeriomem-rng.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

#114: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/timeriomem-rng.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
