WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#65: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_para.h:26:
+#define KVM_ASYNC_PF_ENABLED			(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'resrved' may be misspelled - perhaps 'reserved'?
#96: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:1012:
+	/* Bits 1:5 are resrved, Should be zero */
 	                ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#111: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:1027:
+	vcpu->arch.apf_data = (u32 __user*)(addr + offset);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
