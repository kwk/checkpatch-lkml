#29: 
With broken Sparc64 IOMMU accounting, the kernel submits larger requests then

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#45: FILE: drivers/scsi/a100u2w.c:869:
+	BUG_ON(count_sg > TOTAL_SG_ENTRY);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
