Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#816: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/include/mach/clock.h:136:
+extern int omap1_clk_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#827: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/include/mach/clock.h:146:
+#define OMAP1_DSP_CLOCK		(1 << 6)	/* Registers in DSP space */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
