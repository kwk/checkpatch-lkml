WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#84: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:1653:
+	BUG_ON(per_cpu(cpu_tsc_khz, cpu) == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#95: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:3522:
+			int new_cpu;
+			spin_lock(&kvm_tsc_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
