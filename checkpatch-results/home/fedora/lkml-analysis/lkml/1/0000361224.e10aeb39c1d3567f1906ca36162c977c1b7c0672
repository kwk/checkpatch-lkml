CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#119: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:110:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*load_state)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct smack_load_state)...)
#143: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:188:
+	load_state = kzalloc(sizeof(struct smack_load_state), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rule->smk_subject"
#300: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:370:
+			if (rule->smk_subject == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rule->smk_object"
#304: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:374:
+			if (rule->smk_object == NULL)
