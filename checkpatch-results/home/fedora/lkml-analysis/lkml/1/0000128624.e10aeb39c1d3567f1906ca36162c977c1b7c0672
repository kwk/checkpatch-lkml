#38: 
There are some boards that do not strictly follow SPI standard and use only 3 wires (SCLK, MOSI, SS) for connecting some simple auxiliary chips and controls them with GPIO based 'spi controller'. In this configuration the MISO line is missing (it is not required if the chip does not transfer any data back to host). The example of such board is a NCP ARM S3C64XX based machine. This patch adds support for such non-standard configuration in GPIO-based SPI controller.
