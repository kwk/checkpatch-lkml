In arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S, it said the after get a trap, the stack will be:

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#64: FILE: kernel/fork.c:1339:
+	uint32_t	sp;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#65: FILE: kernel/fork.c:1340:
+	uint32_t	sp;
+	asm volatile("movl %%esp, %0":"=m" (sp));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces required around that ':' (ctx:VxV)

+	asm volatile("movl %%esp, %0":"=m" (sp));
 	                             ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+	if ((regs->cs & 0x3) == 0) {
+		regs->sp = orig_sp;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
