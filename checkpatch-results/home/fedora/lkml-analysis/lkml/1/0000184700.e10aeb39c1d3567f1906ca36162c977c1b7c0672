ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

ricoh_mmc_suspend_noirq(struct device *dev)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#58: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/ricoh_mmc.c:202:
+	BUG_ON(pdev == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pdev"
#58: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/ricoh_mmc.c:202:
+	BUG_ON(pdev == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#83: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/ricoh_mmc.c:233:
+static struct dev_pm_ops ricoh_mmc_pm_opts = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
