#32: 
This size can be influenced using a kernel command line parameter "swiotlb".

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/swiotlb.h:25:
+extern size_t __init swiotlb_set_default_size(size_t size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#75: FILE: lib/swiotlb.c:78:
+static __initdata size_t io_tlb_default_size = 64 * (1<<20);
                                                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after io_tlb_default_size
#75: FILE: lib/swiotlb.c:78:
+static __initdata size_t io_tlb_default_size = 64 * (1<<20);

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
