CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#54: FILE: arch/blackfin/kernel/setup.c:524:
+	max_mem = memory_end = _ramend - DMA_UNCACHED_REGION;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#78: FILE: arch/blackfin/kernel/setup.c:568:
 	if (((unsigned long *)mtd_phys)[0] == ROMSB_WORD0
+	    && ((unsigned long *)mtd_phys)[1] == ROMSB_WORD1) {

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#97: FILE: arch/blackfin/kernel/setup.c:574:
+			pr_info("Limiting kernel memory to %liMB due to anomaly 05000263\n", max_mem >> 20);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
