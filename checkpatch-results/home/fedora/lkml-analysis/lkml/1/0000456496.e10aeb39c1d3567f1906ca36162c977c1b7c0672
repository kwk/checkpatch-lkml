Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
