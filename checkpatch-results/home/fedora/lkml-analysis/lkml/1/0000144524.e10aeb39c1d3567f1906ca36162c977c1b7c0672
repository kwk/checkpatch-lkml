WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct xpc_channel *' should also have an identifier name
#143: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc.h:879:
+extern void (*xpc_send_chctl_opencomplete) (struct xpc_channel *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long *' should also have an identifier name

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#338: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc_channel.c:428:
+	if (chctl_flags & XPC_CHCTL_OPENCOMPLETE) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
