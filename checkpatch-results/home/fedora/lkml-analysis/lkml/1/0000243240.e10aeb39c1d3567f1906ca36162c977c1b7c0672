ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#66: FILE: fs/reiser4/plugin/inode_ops.c:417:
*dentry, struct nameidata *nd)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#72: FILE: fs/reiser4/plugin/inode_ops.c:421:
+int reiser4_permission_common(struct inode *inode, int mask)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#87: FILE: fs/reiser4/plugin/object.h:28:
+int reiser4_permission_common(struct inode *, int mask);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
