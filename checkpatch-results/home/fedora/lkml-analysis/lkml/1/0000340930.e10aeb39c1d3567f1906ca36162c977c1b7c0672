# HG changeset patch

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#105: FILE: include/asm-x86/page.h:146:
+static void inline clear_user_page(void *page, unsigned long vaddr,

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#123: FILE: include/asm-x86/page.h:164:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
