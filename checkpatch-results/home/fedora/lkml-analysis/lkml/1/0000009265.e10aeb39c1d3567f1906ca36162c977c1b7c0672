WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#15: 
Subject: [PATCH] Staging: wlan-ng: Fix 80 character limit warnings Fixed 2 warnings identified by the checkpatch.pl tool which occured due to two lines of code going over the 80 character limit. Fixed by wrapping the lines. Signed-off-by: Jim Dog <jimdog@northern-indymedia.org>

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#51: FILE: drivers/staging/wlan-ng/prism2usb.c:60:
+/*

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
