Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct of_device_id should normally be const
#53: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/86xx/mpc86xx_hpcn.c:451:
+static struct of_device_id mpc86xx_of_ids[] = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
