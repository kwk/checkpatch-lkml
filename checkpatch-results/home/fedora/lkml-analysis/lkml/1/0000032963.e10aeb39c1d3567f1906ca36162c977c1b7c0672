CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#76: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/drm_irq.c:436:
+			if (ret)
[...]
+			else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#78: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/drm_irq.c:438:
+			else {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: include/drm/drmP.h:1298:
+extern void drm_vblank_off(struct drm_device *dev, int crtc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
