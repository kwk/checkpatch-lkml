WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#78: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_kgdb.c:245:
 			printk(KERN_WARNING "kgdb8250: ttyS%d init delayed, "
+			       "use io/mmio syntax for early init.\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#96: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_kgdb.c:273:
+			(unsigned long)simple_strtoul(str, &str, 16);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
