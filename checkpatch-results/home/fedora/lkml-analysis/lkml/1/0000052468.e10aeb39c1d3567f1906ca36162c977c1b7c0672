CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#134: FILE: mm/memory.c:660:
+	rss[2] = rss[1] = rss[0] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
