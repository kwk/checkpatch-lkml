WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#84: FILE: drivers/infiniband/ulp/ipoib/ipoib_main.c:825:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "ipoib_neigh_destructor lock %p wrong type %d !!!!!!!!!!\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ipoib_neigh_destructor', this function's name, in a string
#84: FILE: drivers/infiniband/ulp/ipoib/ipoib_main.c:825:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "ipoib_neigh_destructor lock %p wrong type %d !!!!!!!!!!\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#86: FILE: drivers/infiniband/ulp/ipoib/ipoib_main.c:827:
+		BUG_ON(n->dev->type != ARPHRD_INFINIBAND);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
