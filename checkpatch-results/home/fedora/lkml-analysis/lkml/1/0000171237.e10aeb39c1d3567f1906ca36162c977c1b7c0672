#32: 
The question of tracer's private events aka "subevents" started to raise on the block

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'simplier' may be misspelled - perhaps 'simpler'?
#51: 
interface really fit these needs and actually make these private events simplier to handle
                                                                        ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!event->trace"
#234: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_output.c:438:
+	if (event->trace == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!event->latency_trace"
#236: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_output.c:440:
+	if (event->latency_trace == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!event->raw"
#238: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_output.c:442:
+	if (event->raw == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!event->hex"
#240: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_output.c:444:
+	if (event->hex == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!event->binary"

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#295: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_output.c:511:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
