WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '__fput', this function's name, in a string
#79: FILE: fs/file_table.c:252:
+				printk(KERN_WARNING "__fput() of writeable "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#80: FILE: fs/file_table.c:253:
+				printk(KERN_WARNING "__fput() of writeable "
+						"file with no "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
