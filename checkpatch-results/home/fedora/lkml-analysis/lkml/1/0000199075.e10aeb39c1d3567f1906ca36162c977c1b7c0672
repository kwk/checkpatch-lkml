WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#60: FILE: drivers/leds/Kconfig:161:
+config LEDS_WM8350

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#83: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#88: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-wm8350.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <max_uA_index>
#246: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-wm8350.c:159:
+	uA = (led->max_uA_index * led->value) / LED_FULL;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#248: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-wm8350.c:161:
+	BUG_ON(uA >= ARRAY_SIZE(isink_cur));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
