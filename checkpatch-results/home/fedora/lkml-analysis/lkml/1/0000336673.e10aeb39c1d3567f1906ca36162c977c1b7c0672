CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/topology.h> instead of <asm/topology.h>
#55: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup_64.c:66:
+#include <asm/topology.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

+void *x86_cpu_to_node_map_early_ptr;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
