Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#145: FILE: kernel/smp.c:182:
+		data = list_entry(list.next, struct call_single_data,
+					list);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#169: FILE: kernel/smp.c:195:
+		if (data_flags & CSD_FLAG_WAIT) {
[...]
+		} else if (data_flags & CSD_FLAG_LOCK) {
[...]
+		} else if (data_flags & CSD_FLAG_ALLOC)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
