> ummary: sky2 0000:06:00.0: DMA-API: device driver frees DMA memory with different size

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#185: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/pci_32.h:22:
+#define DECLARE_PCI_UNMAP_ADDR(ADDR_NAME)	dma_addr_t ADDR_NAME;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
