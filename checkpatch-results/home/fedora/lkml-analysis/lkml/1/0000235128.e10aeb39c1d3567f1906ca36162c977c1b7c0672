CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:190:
+extern int func_ptr_is_kernel_text(void *ptr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#88: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:191:
+extern void *dereference_function_descriptor(void *ptr);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#112: FILE: kernel/extable.c:80:
+	addr = (unsigned long) dereference_function_descriptor(ptr);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#112: FILE: kernel/extable.c:80:
+	unsigned long addr;
+	addr = (unsigned long) dereference_function_descriptor(ptr);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "module_text_address"
#115: FILE: kernel/extable.c:83:
+	return module_text_address(addr) != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
