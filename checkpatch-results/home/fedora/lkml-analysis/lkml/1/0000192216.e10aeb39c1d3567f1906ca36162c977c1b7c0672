CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#132: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:261:
+	drive->pc_req_xfer = pc->buf_size = blocks * floppy->block_size;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
