WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'alloc_low_page', this function's name, in a string
#105: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:232:
+		panic("alloc_low_page: ran out of memory");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#115: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:242:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
