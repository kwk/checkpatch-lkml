CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#97: FILE: fs/cifs/cifsfs.h:102:
+extern long cifs_ioctl(struct file *filep, unsigned int command,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#98: FILE: fs/cifs/cifsfs.h:103:
+extern long cifs_ioctl(struct file *filep, unsigned int command,
