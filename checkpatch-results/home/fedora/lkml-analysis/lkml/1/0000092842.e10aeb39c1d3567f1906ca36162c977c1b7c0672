ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while loop
#82: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_export.c:46:
+#define TRACE_FIELD_ZERO(type, item)					\
+	ret = trace_seq_printf(s, "\tfield:" #type " " #item ";\t"	\

 			       (unsigned int)offsetof(typeof(field), item)); \
 	if (!ret)							\

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)
