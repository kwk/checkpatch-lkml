Fixed preffered -> preferred typo
      ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#54: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-debug.c:368:
+static void tab(int n) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 125 exceeds 100 columns
#65: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-debug.c:404:

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
