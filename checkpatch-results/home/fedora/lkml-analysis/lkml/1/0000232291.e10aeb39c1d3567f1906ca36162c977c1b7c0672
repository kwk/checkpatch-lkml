CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:130:
+extern void clockevents_handle_noop(struct clock_event_device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'alrady' may be misspelled - perhaps 'already'?
#111: FILE: kernel/time/tick-broadcast.c:191:
+	 * when the event alrady expired. clockevents_program_event()
 	                  ^^^^^^
