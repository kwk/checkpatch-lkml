In struct device, we already have numa_node member. and we can use dev_to_node()

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'corresonding' may be misspelled - perhaps 'corresponding'?

#193: FILE: arch/x86_64/pci/k8-bus.c:6:

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
