Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:KREALLOC_ARG_REUSE: Reusing the krealloc arg is almost always a bug
#257: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:108:
+	new_name = krealloc(new_name, len, GFP_KERNEL);

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#328: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:208:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "Unable to register kobject %s\n", slot_name);

WARNING:NEEDLESS_IF: kfree(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required
#337: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:221:
+	if (slot_name)
+		kfree(slot_name);
