WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#108: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:310:
+	if (test_bit(EC_FLAGS_GPE_STORM, &ec->flags)) {
+		acpi_disable_gpe(NULL, ec->gpe);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#121: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:323:
+		pr_info(PREFIX "GPE storm detected, "
+			"transactions will use polling mode\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#132: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:447:
+static int acpi_ec_query_unlocked(struct acpi_ec *ec, u8 * data)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#171: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:512:
+	struct acpi_ec_query_handler *handler = cxt;
+	if (!handler)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#188: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:528:

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#188: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:528:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
