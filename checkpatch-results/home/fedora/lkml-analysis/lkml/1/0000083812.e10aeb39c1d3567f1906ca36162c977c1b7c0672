WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .30
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#268: FILE: drivers/hwmon/smsc47m1.c:456:
+			pr_debug(DRVNAME ": "
+				 "Found SMSC LPC47M233, unsupported\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#296: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/tsl2550.c:193:
+		if (c0) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]
 	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#383: FILE: drivers/net/usb/asix.c:1462:
+	.driver_info = (unsigned long) &ax88178_info,

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#387: FILE: drivers/net/usb/asix.c:1466:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#883: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs.h:496:
+extern void nfs_writedata_free(struct nfs_write_data *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct nfs_write_data *' should also have an identifier name
#883: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs.h:496:
+extern void nfs_writedata_free(struct nfs_write_data *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
