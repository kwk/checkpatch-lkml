CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/asm-i386/div64.h:49:
+extern uint64_t div64_64(uint64_t dividend, uint64_t divisor);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#57: FILE: lib/div64.c:83:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(div64_64);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
