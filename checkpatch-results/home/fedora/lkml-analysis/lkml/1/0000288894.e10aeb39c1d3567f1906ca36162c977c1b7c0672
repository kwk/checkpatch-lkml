The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#60: FILE: drivers/pnp/interface.c:387:
+				res->start = simple_strtoul(buf, &buf, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#114: FILE: drivers/pnp/interface.c:429:
+				res->start = res->end =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
