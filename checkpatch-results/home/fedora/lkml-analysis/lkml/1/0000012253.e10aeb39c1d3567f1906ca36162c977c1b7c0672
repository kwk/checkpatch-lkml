CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/kvm_book3s.h:124:
+extern void kvmppc_rmcall(ulong srr0, ulong srr1);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#115: FILE: arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s.c:922:
+	vcpu->arch.rmcall = *(ulong*)kvmppc_rmcall;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
