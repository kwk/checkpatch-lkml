    ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#99: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1080:
+^I^Icurrent->mm->brk = current->mm->start_brk = $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#99: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1080:
+		current->mm->brk = current->mm->start_brk = 

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
