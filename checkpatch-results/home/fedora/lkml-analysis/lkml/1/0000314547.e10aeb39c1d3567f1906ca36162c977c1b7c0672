WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#38: 
# cat /proc/tty/console

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#67: FILE: fs/proc/proc_tty.c:140:
+		struct tty_driver *t = NULL;
+		if (!c->device)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_SEQ_PUTS: Prefer seq_puts to seq_printf
#72: FILE: fs/proc/proc_tty.c:145:
+		seq_printf(m, "\n");
