Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#99: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:193:
+extern void wakeme_after_rcu(struct rcu_head  *head);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#349: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:1059:
+	if (rdp->rcu_sched_sleeping) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "rdp->waitschedlist"
#471: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:1172:
+			if (rdp->waitschedlist != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

#476: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:1177:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#479: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:1180:
+				couldsleepnext = couldsleep = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
