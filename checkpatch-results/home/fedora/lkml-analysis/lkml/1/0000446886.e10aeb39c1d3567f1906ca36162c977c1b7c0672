#65: FILE: drivers/lguest/Kconfig:1:
+config LGUEST

+	depends on X86 && PARAVIRT && NET && EXPERIMENTAL && !X86_PAE
+	select LGUEST_GUEST
+	select HVC_DRIVER
+	---help---
+	  This is a very simple module which allows you to run
+	  multiple instances of the same Linux kernel, using the
+	  "lguest" command found in the Documentation/lguest directory.
+	  Note that "lguest" is pronounced to rhyme with "fell quest",
+	  not "rustyvisor".  See Documentation/lguest/lguest.txt.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.  If curious, say M.  If masochistic, say Y.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
