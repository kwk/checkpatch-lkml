#43: 
I did come up with a question.  I was curious where you envisioned the kfree() for the ktermios allocated in the usb serial?

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*co->termios)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ktermios)...)
#79: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/console.c:146:
+				co->termios = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ktermios),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
