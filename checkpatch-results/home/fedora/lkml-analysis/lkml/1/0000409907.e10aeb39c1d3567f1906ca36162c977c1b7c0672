CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/pid.h:108:
+extern struct pid *FASTCALL(find_pid_ns(int nr, struct pid_namespace *ns));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: include/linux/pid.h:117:
+extern struct pid *find_ge_pid(int nr, struct pid_namespace *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pid_namespace *' should also have an identifier name
#81: FILE: include/linux/pid.h:117:
+extern struct pid *find_ge_pid(int nr, struct pid_namespace *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
