WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#67: 
 arch/x86/{Kconfig.i386 => Kconfig} | 1167 ++++++++++++++-------------

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#90: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:8:
+choice
+	prompt "Architecture?"
+	default X86_32
+	help
+	  Select the architecture.
+	  Previous this was explicit on the commandline when building
+	  the kernel but this choice is now moved to the Kconfig files.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#183: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:32:
+source "arch/x86/Kconfig.i386"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

+config X86_VSMP
+	bool "Support for ScaleMP vSMP"

+	help
+	  Support for ScaleMP vSMP systems.  Say 'Y' here if this kernel is
+	  supposed to run on these EM64T-based machines.  Only choose this option

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#315: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:145:
+config SMP
+	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
+	---help---
+	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
+	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
+	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.
+
+	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
+	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
+	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
+	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
+	  will run faster if you say N here.
+
+	  Note that if you say Y here and choose architecture "586" or
+	  "Pentium" under "Processor family", the kernel will not work on 486
+	  architectures. Similarly, multiprocessor kernels for the "PPro"
+	  architecture may not work on all Pentium based boards.
+
+	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
+	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below. The "Advanced Power
+	  Management" code will be disabled if you say Y here.
+
+	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.txt>,
+	  <file:Documentation/i386/IO-APIC.txt>,
+	  <file:Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO available at
+	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.
+
+	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.
+
+config NR_CPUS
+	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-255)"
+	range 2 255
+	depends on SMP
+	default "32" if X86_NUMAQ || X86_SUMMIT || X86_BIGSMP || X86_ES7000
+	default "8"
+	help
+	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this
+	  kernel will support.  The maximum supported value is 255 and the
+	  minimum value which makes sense is 2.
+
+	  This is purely to save memory - each supported CPU adds
+	  approximately eight kilobytes to the kernel image.
+
+config HOTPLUG_CPU
+	bool "Support for suspend on SMP and hot-pluggable CPUs (EXPERIMENTAL)"
+	depends on SMP && HOTPLUG && EXPERIMENTAL && !X86_VOYAGER
+	help
+	  Say Y here to experiment with turning CPUs off and on.  CPUs
+	  can be controlled through /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#.
+	  This is also required for suspend/hibernation on SMP systems.
+
+	  Say N if you want to disable CPU hotplug and don't need to
+	  suspend.
