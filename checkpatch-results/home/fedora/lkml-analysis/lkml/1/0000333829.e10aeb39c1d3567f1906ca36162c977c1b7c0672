WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#192: FILE: include/linux/mcount.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_MCOUNT_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#222: FILE: include/linux/mcount.h:31:
+extern void mcount(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
