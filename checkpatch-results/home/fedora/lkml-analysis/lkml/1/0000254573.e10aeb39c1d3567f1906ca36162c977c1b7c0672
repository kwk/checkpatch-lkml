Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#146: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:81:
+extern void rebuild_sched_domains(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#262: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2884:
 	if (!cpu_isset(dest_cpu, p->cpus_allowed)
+	    || unlikely(!cpu_active(dest_cpu)))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!doms_new"
#322: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7647:
+	if (doms_new == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!doms_new"
#331: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7663:
+	if (doms_new == NULL) {

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#393: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7793:
+static int update_runtime(struct notifier_block *nfb,
+				unsigned long action, void *hcpu)

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
