CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: include/asm-x86/mpspec.h:50:
+extern void mp_register_lapic(int id, u8 enabled);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#121: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse_32.c:810:
+void __cpuinit mp_register_lapic (int id, u8 enabled)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
