ocfs2_dir_lookup_result'. In this patch, it simply holds the same tuple, but

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bh"
#90: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dir.c:512:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
