Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#77: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event.c:241:
+static struct event_constraint intel_core2_event_constraints[] =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initconst should be placed after core_pmu
#245: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event.c:2364:
+static __initconst struct x86_pmu core_pmu = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1377655732.3619.19.camel@joe-AO722/

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of __initconst requires a separate use of const
#245: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event.c:2364:
+static __initconst struct x86_pmu core_pmu = {

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.
