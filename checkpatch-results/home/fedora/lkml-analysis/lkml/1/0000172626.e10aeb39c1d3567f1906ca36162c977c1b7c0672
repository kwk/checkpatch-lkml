Here is the commit 05fe478dd04e02fa230c305ab9b5616669821dd3:

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#86: FILE: mm/filemap.c:213:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation
