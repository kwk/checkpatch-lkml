#52: 
Now that kmem_cache_init() happens before sched_init(), we should use kzalloc()

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#147: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2878:
+		vc_cons[currcons].d = vc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct vc_data), GFP_NOWAIT);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*vc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct vc_data)...)
#147: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2878:
+		vc_cons[currcons].d = vc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct vc_data), GFP_NOWAIT);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
