CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#64: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3550:
+		next->timestamp = next->last_ran = now;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
