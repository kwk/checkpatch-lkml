#88: FILE: include/linux/ring_buffer.h:112:
+__ring_buffer_alloc(unsigned long size, unsigned flags, struct lock_class_key *key);

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#125: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:640:
+struct ring_buffer *__ring_buffer_alloc(unsigned long size, unsigned flags, struct lock_class_key *key)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
