+	bool "Prompt for config options which will break your computer"
+	---help---
+	  Some kernel developers sometimes need to tune kernel parameters
+	  outside of their normal limits.  Without complete knowledge of
+	  exactly what you are doing you are likely to corrupt the laws of
+	  physics and destroy the universe (well, not quite, but you'll
+	  certainly corrupt your data and crash your box).  If you really
+	  know what you're doing and accept that if it breaks you get to
+	  keep the pieces, then go ahead and enable this option.
+	  
+	  NOTICE:  Bug reports where this option is turned on in the kernel

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
