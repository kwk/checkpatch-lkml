CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#127: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:48:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct mtrr_ops should normally be const
#146: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:62:
+static struct mtrr_ops *mtrr_ops[X86_VENDOR_NUM];

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dev"
#169: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:82:
+	if (dev != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#534: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:385:

+				" 0x%lx000,0x%lx000\n", base, size, lbase,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
