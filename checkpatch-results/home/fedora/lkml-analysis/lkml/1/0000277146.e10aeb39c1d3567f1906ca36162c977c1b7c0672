CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:380:
+extern void __tasklet_hi_schedule_first(struct tasklet_struct *t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#108: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:407:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(__tasklet_hi_schedule_first);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
