CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <spaceBitmapDesc>
#61: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:949:
+			(sizeof(struct spaceBitmapDesc) << 3) +

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bitmap"
#72: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:960:
+	if (bitmap == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#73: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:961:
+		udf_error(sb, __FUNCTION__,

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#75: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:963:
+			  "Unable to allocate space for bitmap "
+			  "and %d buffer_head pointers", nr_groups);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
