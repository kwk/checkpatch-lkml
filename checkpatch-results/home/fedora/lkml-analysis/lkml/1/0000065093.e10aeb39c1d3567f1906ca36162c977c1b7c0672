commit 23af51ecfb04ff65bae51bd8e2270f4449abc789 upstream.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#89: FILE: drivers/mtd/chips/cfi_util.c:85:
+	/* M29W128G flashes require an additional reset command
+	   when exit qry mode */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cfi->mfr == CFI_MFR_ST'
#90: FILE: drivers/mtd/chips/cfi_util.c:86:
+	if ((cfi->mfr == CFI_MFR_ST) && (cfi->id == 0x227E || cfi->id == 0x7E))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
