split it into subsystem-related patches, because compilation would be broken

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#194: FILE: include/linux/device.h:68:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
