CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#95: FILE: drivers/pci/dmar.c:552:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#178: FILE: drivers/pci/dmar.c:635:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
