Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#130: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:352:
+#define RB_WRITE_INTCNT		(1 << 20)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#236: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:583:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#260: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:607:
+static int inline

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#414: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:761:
+	page = head = cpu_buffer->head_page;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
