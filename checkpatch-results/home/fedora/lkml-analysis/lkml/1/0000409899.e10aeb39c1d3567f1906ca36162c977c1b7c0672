CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*ns)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct pid_namespace)...)
#149: FILE: kernel/pid.c:467:
+	ns = kmalloc(sizeof(struct pid_namespace), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ns"
#150: FILE: kernel/pid.c:468:
+	if (ns == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ns->pid_cachep"
#158: FILE: kernel/pid.c:476:
+	if (ns->pid_cachep == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "new_ns"
#217: FILE: kernel/pid.c:534:
+	if (new_ns != NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "parent"
#233: FILE: kernel/pid.c:550:
+	if (parent != NULL)
