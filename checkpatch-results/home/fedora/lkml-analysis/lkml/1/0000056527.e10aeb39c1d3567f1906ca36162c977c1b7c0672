#51: 
I'm sure that system engineeres will not have to have the same experience as I did.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#71: FILE: kernel/signal.c:192:
+static int rlimit_caution_count = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#80: FILE: kernel/signal.c:217:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open brace '{'

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#82: FILE: kernel/signal.c:219:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "reached the limit of pending signalis on pid %d\n", current->pid);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
