Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

# tab space tab -> tab tab, strip trailing whitespace

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
