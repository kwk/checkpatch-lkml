CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#645: FILE: fs/select.c:755:
+		poll_select_set_timeout(to, timeout_msecs / MSEC_PER_SEC,
+			NSEC_PER_MSEC * (timeout_msecs % MSEC_PER_SEC));

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#663: FILE: fs/select.c:768:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#750: FILE: include/linux/poll.h:117:
+extern int do_select(int n, fd_set_bits *fds, struct timespec *end_time);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
