WARNING:BAD_STABLE_ADDRESS_STYLE: Invalid email format for stable: 'stable <stable@kernel.org>', prefer 'stable@kernel.org'
#43: 
Cc: stable <stable@kernel.org>

The email format for stable is incorrect.
Some valid options for stable address are::

  1. stable@vger.kernel.org
  2. stable@kernel.org

For adding version info, the following comment style should be used::

  stable@vger.kernel.org # version info

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#130: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:21:
+extern void device_pm_add(struct device *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#135: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:26:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
