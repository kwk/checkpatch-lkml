Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#58: 
updated to not contain the cpu which goes down even after the thread finishes

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#90: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:205:
+	/* make sure we are not running on the cpu which goes down,
+	   cpu_active_mask is altered even after we return! */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
