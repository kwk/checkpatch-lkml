    ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#178: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-gru/grutables.h:646:
+extern long gru_get_gseg_statistics(unsigned long arg);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
