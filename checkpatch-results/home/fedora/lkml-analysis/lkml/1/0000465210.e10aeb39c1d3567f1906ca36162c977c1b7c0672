ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#91: FILE: mm/slab.c:928:
+static void next_reap_node(unsigned int cpu)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
