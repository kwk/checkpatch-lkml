CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'entity' - possible side-effects?

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'entity' may be better as '(entity)' to avoid precedence issues

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "entity"
#109: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:387:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
