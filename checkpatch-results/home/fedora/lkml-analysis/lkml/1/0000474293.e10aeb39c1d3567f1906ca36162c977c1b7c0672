CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*seg->res)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct resource)...)
#71: FILE: arch/s390/mm/extmem.c:309:
+	seg->res = kzalloc(sizeof(struct resource), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!seg->res"
#72: FILE: arch/s390/mm/extmem.c:310:
+	if (seg->res == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 24)
#105: FILE: arch/s390/mm/extmem.c:348:
+	if (rc == SEG_TYPE_SC)
+			seg->res->flags |= IORESOURCE_READONLY;

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#115: FILE: arch/s390/mm/extmem.c:357:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
