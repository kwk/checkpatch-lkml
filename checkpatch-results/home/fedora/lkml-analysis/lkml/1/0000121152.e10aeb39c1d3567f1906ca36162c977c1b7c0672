CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: include/linux/ptrace.h:85:
+extern int alloc_ptrace_task(struct task_struct *child);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#82: FILE: include/linux/tracehook.h:256:
+static inline int tracehook_init_task(struct task_struct *child,
+					unsigned long clone_flags, int trace)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cmpxchg"
#143: FILE: kernel/ptrace.c:188:
+	if (cmpxchg(&tsk->ptrace_task, NULL, ptrace_task) != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
