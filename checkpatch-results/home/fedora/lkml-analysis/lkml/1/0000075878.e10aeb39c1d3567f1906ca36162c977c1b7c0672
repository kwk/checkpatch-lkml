WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#69: FILE: drivers/power/Kconfig:32:

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#92: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#97: FILE: drivers/power/wm831x_power.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: static const char * array should probably be static const char * const

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#545: FILE: drivers/power/wm831x_power.c:449:
+	 * anything except kick user space */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#551: FILE: drivers/power/wm831x_power.c:455:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#705: FILE: drivers/power/wm831x_power.c:609:
+static __devinit int wm831x_power_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*power)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct wm831x_power)...)
#715: FILE: drivers/power/wm831x_power.c:619:
+	power = kzalloc(sizeof(struct wm831x_power), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!power"
#716: FILE: drivers/power/wm831x_power.c:620:
+	if (power == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SUSPECT_COMMA_SEMICOLON: Possible comma where semicolon could be used
#751: FILE: drivers/power/wm831x_power.c:655:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#883: FILE: include/linux/mfd/wm831x/pmu.h:2:
+ * include/linux/mfd/wm831x/pmu.h -- PMU for WM831x

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#1033: FILE: include/linux/mfd/wm831x/pmu.h:152:
+#define WM831X_CHG_STATE_TRICKLE     (1 << WM831X_CHG_STATE_SHIFT)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
