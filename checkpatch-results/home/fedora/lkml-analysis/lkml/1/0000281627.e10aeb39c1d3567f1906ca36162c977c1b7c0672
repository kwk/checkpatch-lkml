WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#96: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#101: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/immediate.c:1:
+#include <linux/module.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#112: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/immediate.c:12:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#180: FILE: include/asm-sparc64/immediate.h:26:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#189: FILE: include/asm-sparc64/immediate.h:35:
+extern int arch_imv_update(const struct __imv *imv, int early);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#202: FILE: kernel/immediate.c:65:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
