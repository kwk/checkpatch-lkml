#27: 
side-effects to allow a definition of BUG_ON that drops the code completely.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#71: FILE: fs/ext2/balloc.c:248:
+	BUG_ON(bad);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
