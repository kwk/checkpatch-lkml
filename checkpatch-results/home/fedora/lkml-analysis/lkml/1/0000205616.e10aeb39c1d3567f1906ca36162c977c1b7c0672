+	---help---
+	  The BFQ I/O scheduler tries to distribute bandwidth among
+	  all processes in the system, according to their weights,
+	  which can be set using task ioprio values.  It aims at giving
+	  deterministic guarantees on the distribution of the service
+	  provided.  If compiled built-in (saying Y here), BFQ can
+	  be configured to support hierarchical scheduling.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
