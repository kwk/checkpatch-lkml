WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#85: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:2173:
+	BUG_ON(!handle);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#87: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:2175:
+	ret = ext4_get_blocks_wrap(handle, inode, iblock, max_blocks,
+			bh_result, create, 0, EXT4_DELALLOC_RSVED);

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#89: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:2177:
 	if (ret > 0) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#94: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:2182:
+			int retval;
+			retval = ext4_jbd2_file_inode(handle, inode);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
