Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#102: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/time.c:104:
+extern void alarm_handler(int sig, struct sigcontext *sc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
