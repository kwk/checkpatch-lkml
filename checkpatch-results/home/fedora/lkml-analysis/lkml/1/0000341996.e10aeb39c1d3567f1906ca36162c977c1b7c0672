#27: 
This patch replaces lapic structure with kvm_vcpu in ioapic.c, making ioapic

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#77: FILE: drivers/kvm/ioapic.c:215:
+		vcpu = kvm_get_lowest_prio_vcpu(ioapic->kvm, vector,
+				deliver_bitmask);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "vcpu"
#78: FILE: drivers/kvm/ioapic.c:216:
+		if (vcpu != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
