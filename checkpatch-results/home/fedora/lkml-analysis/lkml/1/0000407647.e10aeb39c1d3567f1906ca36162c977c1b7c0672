WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#72: FILE: scripts/kconfig/conf.c:560:
+				"*** You have not yet configured your "PROJECT_NAME"!\n"

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#82: FILE: scripts/kconfig/conf.c:607:
+			fprintf(stderr, _("\n*** "PROJECT_NAME" configuration requires explicit update.\n\n"));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#82: FILE: scripts/kconfig/conf.c:607:
+			fprintf(stderr, _("\n*** "PROJECT_NAME" configuration requires explicit update.\n\n"));

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#103: FILE: scripts/kconfig/conf.c:619:
+		if (input_mode != ask_silent || conf_write_autoconf()) {
+			return 0;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#119: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:428:

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#128: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:680:

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#135: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:686:
+		       " * "PROJECT_NAME" version: %s\n"

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#210: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:406:
+^I                _("%s - "PROJECT_NAME" v%s Configuration"),$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#210: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:406:
+	                _("%s - "PROJECT_NAME" v%s Configuration"),

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#219: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:915:
 					   _("Do you wish to save your "
+					     "new configuration?\nPress "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
