ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#60: FILE: drivers/char/watchdog/softdog.c:74:
+static int panic_instead = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 157 exceeds 100 columns
#87: FILE: drivers/char/watchdog/softdog.c:274:
+static char banner[] __initdata = KERN_INFO "Software Watchdog Timer: 0.07 initialized. soft_noboot=%d soft_margin=%d sec panic_instead=%d (nowayout= %d)\n";

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
