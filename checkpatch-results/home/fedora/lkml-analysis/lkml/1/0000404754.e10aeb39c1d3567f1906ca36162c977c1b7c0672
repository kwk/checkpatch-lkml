WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct platform_suspend_ops should normally be const
#105: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:83:
+extern struct platform_suspend_ops *suspend_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#115: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:89:
+extern void suspend_set_ops(struct platform_suspend_ops *ops);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
