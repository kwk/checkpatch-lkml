WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#179: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:401:
+		int line_len = getline(&line, &n, file);
+		if (line_len < 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#193: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:410:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sym"
#204: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:419:
+		if (sym == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
