CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/cacheflush.h> instead of <asm/cacheflush.h>
#48: FILE: arch/x86/pci/i386.c:34:
+#include <asm/cacheflush.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#59: FILE: arch/x86/pci/i386.c:305:
+	u64 adr = (u64)vma->vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT;
+	free_mattr(adr, adr + vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#60: FILE: arch/x86/pci/i386.c:306:
+	free_mattr(adr, adr + vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start,
+		pgprot_val(vma->vm_page_prot) & _PAGE_CACHE_MASK);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#63: FILE: arch/x86/pci/i386.c:309:
+static struct vm_operations_struct pci_mmap_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
