WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'synchromized' may be misspelled - perhaps 'synchronized'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

+static void add_ibs_begin(struct oprofile_cpu_buffer *cpu_buf, int code,

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#97: FILE: drivers/oprofile/buffer_sync.c:347:
+	if (mm) {
[...]
+	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#258: FILE: drivers/oprofile/cpu_buffer.c:254:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#281: FILE: drivers/oprofile/cpu_buffer.c:314:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
