CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#73: FILE: fs/open.c:1031:
+		fd = allocate_fd((unsigned int) flags);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#99: FILE: include/linux/file.h:88:
+extern int allocate_fd(unsigned long flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
