#38: 
I noticed this when looking at a battery plugin that reported "127% charged".

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#90: FILE: drivers/acpi/battery.c:214:
+		/* broken batteries return the design_capacity
+		as capacity_now when completely charged */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
