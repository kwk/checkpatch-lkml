CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!card->local_node"
#146: FILE: drivers/firewire/fw-card.c:307:
+	if (card->local_node == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#200: FILE: drivers/firewire/fw-card.c:362:
 		    lock_data[0] != cpu_to_be32(0x3f)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
