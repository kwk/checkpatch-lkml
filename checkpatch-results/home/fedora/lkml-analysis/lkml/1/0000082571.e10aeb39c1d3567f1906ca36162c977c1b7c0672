WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ftrace_event_call *' should also have an identifier name
#71: FILE: include/linux/ftrace_event.h:121:
+	int			(*define_fields)(struct ftrace_event_call *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#113: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_export.c:122:
+int ftrace_define_fields_##call(struct ftrace_event_call *event_call);	\

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
