CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#55: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/amd_iommu.h:28:
+extern int amd_iommu_init_passthrough(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#75: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/amd_iommu_types.h:198:
+#define PD_PASSTHROUGH_MASK	(1UL << 2) /* domain has no page

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#76: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/amd_iommu_types.h:199:
+#define PD_PASSTHROUGH_MASK	(1UL << 2) /* domain has no page
+					      translation */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
