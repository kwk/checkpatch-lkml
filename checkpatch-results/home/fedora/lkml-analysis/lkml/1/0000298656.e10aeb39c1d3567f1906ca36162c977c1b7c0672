#32: 
functionality by using a merge buffer tape->merge_bh which is flushed in chunks

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*merge_bh)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct idetape_bh)...)
#116: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1305:
+	merge_bh = kmalloc(sizeof(struct idetape_bh), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#142: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1439:
+	struct idetape_bh *bh = tape->merge_bh;
+	tape->bh = tape->merge_bh;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "tape->merge_bh"
#155: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1643:
+	if (tape->merge_bh != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
