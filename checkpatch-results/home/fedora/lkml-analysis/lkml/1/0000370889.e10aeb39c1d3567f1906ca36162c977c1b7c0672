Subject: [PATCH 23/75] sysfs: make sysfs_add/remove_one() call link/unlink_sibling() implictly
                                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#105: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:526:
+	BUG_ON(sd->s_flags & SYSFS_FLAG_REMOVED);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
