[patch] ioremap sanity check to catch mapping requests exceeding the BAR sizes

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:172:
+extern int iomem_map_sanity_check(resource_size_t addr, unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
