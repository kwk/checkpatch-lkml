WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'u32 *' should also have an identifier name
#62: FILE: drivers/staging/dt3155/allocator.h:27:
+int allocator_init(u32 *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
