Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#159: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi-id.c:142:
+static const struct attribute_group* sys_dmi_attribute_groups[] = {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

 };
+static const struct attribute_group *ep_dev_groups[] = {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
