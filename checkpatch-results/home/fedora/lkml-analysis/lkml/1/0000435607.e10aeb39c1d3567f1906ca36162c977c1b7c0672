ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#136: FILE: drivers/char/agp/intel-agp.c:31:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#152: FILE: drivers/char/agp/intel-agp.c:42:
+#define I815_ERRSTS		0xc8 /* undocumented in i815 spec; since this one is =
+#define I815_UNKNOWN_E8		0xe8

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
