Subject: [PATCH] au1xmmc: remove db1x00 board-specific functions from driver

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'h' - possible side-effects?
#103: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/au1xmmc.c:84:
+#define DMA_CHANNEL(h) \
+	(((h)->flags & HOST_F_XMIT) ? (h)->dma.tx_chan : (h)->dma.rx_chan)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#152: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/au1xmmc.c:128:
+};
+static int memid;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#285: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/au1xmmc.c:822:
+		if (!(host->flags & HOST_F_DMA) && (status & SD_STATUS_NE))
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#428: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/au1xmmc.c:904:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
