ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#42: FILE: sound/oss/dmasound/dmasound_core.c:1353:
+static const struct file_operations sq_fops_record =

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
