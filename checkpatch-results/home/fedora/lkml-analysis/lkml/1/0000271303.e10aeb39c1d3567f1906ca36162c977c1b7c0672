WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 126 exceeds 100 columns
#186: FILE: include/linux/pnp.h:504:
+static inline int pnp_possible_config(struct pnp_dev *dev, int type, resource_size_t base, resource_size_t size) { return 0; }

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
