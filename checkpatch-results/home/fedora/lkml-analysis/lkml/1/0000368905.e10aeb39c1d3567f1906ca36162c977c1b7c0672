> > [  233.438890] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 7d93e000

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#121: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:781:
+			struct Scsi_Host *shost = cmd->device->host;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#123: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:783:
+			BUG_ON(!shost->use_sg_chaining);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
