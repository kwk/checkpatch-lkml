#38: 
> The patch contains changes for updating the ctime and mtime fields for memory mapped files:

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#140: FILE: fs/inode.c:1240:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(inode_update_time);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bdev"
#155: FILE: fs/block_dev.c:616:
+	if (bdev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#175: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1491:
+extern void bd_inode_update_time(struct inode *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#175: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1491:
+extern void bd_inode_update_time(struct inode *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#184: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1896:
+extern void inode_update_time(struct inode *inode);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#249: FILE: mm/msync.c:81:
+		if ((flags & (MS_SYNC|MS_ASYNC)) &&
 		                     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
