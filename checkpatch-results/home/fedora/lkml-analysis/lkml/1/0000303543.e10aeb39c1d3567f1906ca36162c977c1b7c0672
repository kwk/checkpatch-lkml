#29: 
There's a nasty memory leak in firewire-ohci's ar_context_tasklet(), in that

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#72: FILE: drivers/firewire/fw-ohci.c:592:
+		start = buffer = ab;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
