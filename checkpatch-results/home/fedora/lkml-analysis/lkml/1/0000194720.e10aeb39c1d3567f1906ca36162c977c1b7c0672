WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#104: FILE: drivers/w1/w1.h:130:
+       void            (*write_block)(void *, u8 *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'u8 *' should also have an identifier name
