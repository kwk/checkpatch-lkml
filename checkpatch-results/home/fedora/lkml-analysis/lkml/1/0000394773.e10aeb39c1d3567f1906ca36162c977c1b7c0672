WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'use'
#33: 
in the device_add, we try to use use parent numa_node.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'direclty' may be misspelled - perhaps 'directly'?
#35: 
then we could use device->numa_node direclty for all device.
                                    ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#71: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:676:
+	if (parent) {
+		set_dev_node(dev, dev_to_node(parent));
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
