#36: 
Implement handling for pathless pioctls.  Because these take no path argument,

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('
#147: FILE: fs/pioctl.c:67:
+static struct pathless_pioctl_handler **find_pathless_pioctl(

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#203: FILE: fs/pioctl.c:123:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#204: FILE: fs/pioctl.c:124:

+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct vice_ioctl *' should also have an identifier name
#249: FILE: include/linux/pioctl.h:50:
+	long (*pioctl)(int cmd, struct vice_ioctl *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#252: FILE: include/linux/pioctl.h:53:
+extern int pathless_pioctl_register(struct pathless_pioctl_handler *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
