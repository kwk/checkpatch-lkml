ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#70: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:124:
+	if (lines_string && (n_lines = atoi(lines_string)) > 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#73: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:127:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#75: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:129:
+		struct winsize ws;
+		if (!ioctl(1, TIOCGWINSZ, &ws) && ws.ws_row)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
