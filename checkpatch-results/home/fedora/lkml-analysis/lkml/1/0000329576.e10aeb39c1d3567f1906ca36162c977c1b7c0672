CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#67: FILE: drivers/net/bfin_mac.c:812:
+	emac_hashhi = emac_hashlo = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
#90: FILE: drivers/net/bfin_mac.c:835:
