src_pa, u64 *dest,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'sie' may be misspelled - perhaps 'size'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#557: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/kvm_ppc.h:60:
+extern int kvmppc_emulate_mmio(struct kvm_run *run, struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#595: FILE: virt/kvm/ioapic.c:93:
+		int injected = ioapic_deliver(ioapic, idx);
+		if (injected && pent->fields.trig_mode == IOAPIC_LEVEL_TRIG)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
