CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#141: FILE: drivers/block/floppy.c:1444:
+		if (!probing) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

 	                                               ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'request_done', this function's name, in a string
#346: FILE: drivers/block/floppy.c:2331:
+		pr_info("floppy.c: no request in request_done\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#562: FILE: drivers/block/floppy.c:3665:
+			const char *prepend;
+			if (!has_drive) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
