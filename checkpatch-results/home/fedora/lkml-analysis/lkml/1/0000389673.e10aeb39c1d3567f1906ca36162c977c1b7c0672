#27: 
As there is only one zonelist, it must be filtered for zones that are unusable

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#59: FILE: include/linux/mmzone.h:700:
+static inline unsigned long *zonelist_gfp_skip(struct zonelist *zonelist,
+					enum zone_type highest_zoneidx)

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#70: FILE: include/linux/mmzone.h:710:
+	for (z = zonelist_gfp_skip(zonelist, highest_zoneidx);
[...]
 		z++);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#104: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2058:
+		unsigned long *z;
+		z = first_zones_zonelist(zl, target);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
