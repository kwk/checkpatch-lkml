CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/dma-mapping.h:317:
+	extern int xen_range_needs_mapping(phys_addr_t paddr, size_t size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Or you need to use a function pointer in a strange way.
