WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'THRE' may be misspelled - perhaps 'THREE'?
#59: 
  dodgy THRE.
        ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BAD_STABLE_ADDRESS_STYLE: Invalid email format for stable: 'stable <stable@kernel.org>', prefer 'stable@kernel.org'
#65: 
Cc: stable <stable@kernel.org>

The email format for stable is incorrect.
Some valid options for stable address are::

  1. stable@vger.kernel.org
  2. stable@kernel.org

For adding version info, the following comment style should be used::

  stable@vger.kernel.org # version info

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#79: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:86:
+#define BOTH_EMPTY ^I(UART_LSR_TEMT | UART_LSR_THRE)$

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#81: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:88:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
