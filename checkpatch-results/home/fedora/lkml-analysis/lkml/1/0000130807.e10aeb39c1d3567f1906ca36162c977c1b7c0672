CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "driver"
#118: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1109:
+	return driver != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#124: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1115:
+	struct tty_driver *driver;
+	initdev_wait(BOOTDEV_CONSOLE, have_all_consoles);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
