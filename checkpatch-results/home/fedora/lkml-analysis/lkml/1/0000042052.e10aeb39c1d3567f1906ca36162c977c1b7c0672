Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "al.sym"
#314: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-report.c:455:
+		if (al.sym != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!al.sym"
#473: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:950:
+	    al.sym == NULL)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#509: FILE: tools/perf/util/event.c:262:
+	if (cpumode & PERF_RECORD_MISC_KERNEL) {
[...]
+	} else if (cpumode & PERF_RECORD_MISC_USER)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
