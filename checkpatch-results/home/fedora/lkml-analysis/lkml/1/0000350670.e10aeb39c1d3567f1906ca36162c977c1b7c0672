CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#247: FILE: fs/union.c:715:
+	r->cur_off = r->last_off = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#290: FILE: fs/union.c:837:

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'r->path.dentry == path->dentry'
#329: FILE: fs/union.c:1065:
+		if ((r->path.dentry == path->dentry) &&
+		    (r->path.mnt == path->mnt))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#441: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:820:
+extern void rdcache_invalidate(struct path *path);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
