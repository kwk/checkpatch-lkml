WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#31: 
Introduce MNT_UNION, MS_UNION and FS_WHT flags. There are the necessary flags

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#61: FILE: fs/namespace.c:1261:
+	 * doesn't know about whiteouts */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:ENOTSUPP: ENOTSUPP is not a SUSV4 error code, prefer EOPNOTSUPP
#62: FILE: fs/namespace.c:1262:
+	err = -ENOTSUPP;

ENOTSUPP is not a standard error code and should be avoided in new patches.
EOPNOTSUPP should be used instead.
