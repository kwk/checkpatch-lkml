The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const

+static struct dentry_operations proc_dentry_shadow_operations =

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
