Description: Change in error message in function fore200e_kmalloc(), in file drivers/atm/fore200e.c.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#43: FILE: drivers/atm/fore200e.c:181:
+	printk(FORE200E "kzalloc() failed, requested size = %d, flags = 0x%x\n",			size, flags);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
