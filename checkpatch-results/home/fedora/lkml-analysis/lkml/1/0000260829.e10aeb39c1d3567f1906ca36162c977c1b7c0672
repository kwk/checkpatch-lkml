WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#46: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/s3cmci.c:993:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#60: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/s3cmci.c:1007:
+	if (s3cmci_card_present(host) == 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
