ERROR:WEAK_DECLARATION: Using weak declarations can have unintended link defects
#69: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:282:
+extern int __weak kgdb_mem2hex(char *mem, char *buf, int count);

Using weak declarations like __attribute__((weak)) or __weak
can have unintended link defects.  Avoid using them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:282:
+extern int __weak kgdb_mem2hex(char *mem, char *buf, int count);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
