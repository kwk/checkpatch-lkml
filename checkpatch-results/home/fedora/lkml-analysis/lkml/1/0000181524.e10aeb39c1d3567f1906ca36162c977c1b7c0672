#68: 
This concept got ported to mainline from the -rt tree, where it was originally

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#148: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:333:
+extern int mutex_spin_on_owner(struct mutex *lock, struct thread_info *owner);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#192: FILE: kernel/mutex.c:143:
+^I       ^Iunsigned long ip)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#192: FILE: kernel/mutex.c:143:
+^I       ^Iunsigned long ip)$

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#192: FILE: kernel/mutex.c:143:
