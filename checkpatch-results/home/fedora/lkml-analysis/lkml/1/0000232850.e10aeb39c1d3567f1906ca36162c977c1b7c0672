ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#69: FILE: kernel/sys.c:158:
 	switch (which) {
+		case PRIO_THREAD:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#80: FILE: kernel/sys.c:168:
+			if (who)
[...]
+			else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
