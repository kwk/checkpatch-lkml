WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#15: 
Subject: [PATCH 3/4] Char: ip2, fix sparse warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#45: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/i2lib.c:648:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <pB>
#57: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/i2lib.c:1837:
+			write_unlock_irqrestore(&pB->read_fifo_spinlock,

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#58: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/i2lib.c:1838:
+			write_unlock_irqrestore(&pB->read_fifo_spinlock,
+					bflags);
