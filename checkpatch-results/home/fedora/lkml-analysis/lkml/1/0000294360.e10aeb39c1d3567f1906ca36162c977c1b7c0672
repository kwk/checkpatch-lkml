WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 124 exceeds 100 columns
#112: FILE: fs/gfs2/dir.c:973:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "i_depth %u lf_depth %u index %u\n", dip->i_depth, be16_to_cpu(oleaf->lf_depth), index);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
