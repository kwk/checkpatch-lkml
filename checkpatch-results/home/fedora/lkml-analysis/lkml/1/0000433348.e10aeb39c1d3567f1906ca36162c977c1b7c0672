WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#154: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:35:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(no_pci_devices);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#194: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:428:
+extern int no_pci_devices(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
