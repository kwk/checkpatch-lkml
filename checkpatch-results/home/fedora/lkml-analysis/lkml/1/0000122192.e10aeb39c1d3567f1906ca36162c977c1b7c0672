CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: arch/ia64/include/asm/dma-mapping.h:190:
+extern void *swiotlb_alloc_boot(size_t size, unsigned long nslabs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
