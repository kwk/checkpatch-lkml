CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#108: FILE: include/linux/rmap.h:122:
+int wipe_page_reference(struct page *page, struct mem_cgroup *memcg,
+		    struct page_reference_context *refctx);

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#210: FILE: mm/rmap.c:409:
+			if (vma->vm_flags & VM_EXEC) {

+			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
