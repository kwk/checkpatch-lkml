CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#99: FILE: include/asm-generic/hw_breakpoint.h:146:
+extern void enable_hw_breakpoint(struct hw_breakpoint *bp,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around tsk->thread
#130: FILE: kernel/hw_breakpoint.c:481:
+	struct thread_struct *thread = &(tsk->thread);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
