ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#72: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:16:
+extern inline unsigned long FIXME_page_address(struct page * page)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
