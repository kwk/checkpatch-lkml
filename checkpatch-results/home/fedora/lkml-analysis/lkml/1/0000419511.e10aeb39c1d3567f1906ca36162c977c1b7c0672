WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pipe_buf_operations should normally be const
#126: FILE: kernel/relay.c:1043:
+static struct pipe_buf_operations relay_pipe_buf_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#192: FILE: kernel/relay.c:1109:
+			if (this_end > nonpad_end) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
