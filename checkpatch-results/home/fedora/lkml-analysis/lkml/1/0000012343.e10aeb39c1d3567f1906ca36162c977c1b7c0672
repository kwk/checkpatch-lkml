CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#73: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/pci_x86.h:113:
+extern void __init pcibios_irq_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!raw_pci_ops"
#162: FILE: arch/x86/pci/irq.c:1117:
+	if (raw_pci_ops == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
