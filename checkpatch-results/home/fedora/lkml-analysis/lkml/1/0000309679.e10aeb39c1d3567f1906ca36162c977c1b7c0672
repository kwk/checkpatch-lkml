#33: 
Skip DMA initialization completely on revs < 0x20 by setting IDE_HFLAG_NO_DMA

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#49: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/alim15x3.c:733:
 static void __devinit init_dma_ali15x3 (ide_hwif_t *hwif, unsigned long dmabase)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#63: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/alim15x3.c:798:
+		d.mwdma_mask = d.swdma_mask = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
