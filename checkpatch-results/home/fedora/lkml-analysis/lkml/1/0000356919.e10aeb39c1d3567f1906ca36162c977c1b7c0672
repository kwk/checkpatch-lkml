#33: 
* more explicit statement that proc_subdir_lock protects only ->subdir lists.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#123: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:735:
+	if (!atomic_read(&de->count))
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#127: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:739:
+		printk("remove_proc_entry: %s/%s busy, count=%d\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'remove_proc_entry', this function's name, in a string
#127: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:739:
+		printk("remove_proc_entry: %s/%s busy, count=%d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#128: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:740:
+		printk("remove_proc_entry: %s/%s busy, count=%d\n",
+			parent->name, de->name, atomic_read(&de->count));
