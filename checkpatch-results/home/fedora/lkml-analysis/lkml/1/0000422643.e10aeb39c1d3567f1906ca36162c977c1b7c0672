Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#300: FILE: include/linux/raid/xor.h:8:
+extern void xor_blocks(unsigned int count, unsigned int bytes, void

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
