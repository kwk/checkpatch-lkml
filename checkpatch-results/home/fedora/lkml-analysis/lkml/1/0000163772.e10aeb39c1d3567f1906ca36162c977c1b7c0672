CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#155: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:473:
+extern void suspend_device_irqs(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#191: FILE: kernel/power/main.c:303:
+	BUG_ON(!irqs_disabled());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
