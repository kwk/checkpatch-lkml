ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#136: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_branch.c:195:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

#373: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_stat.c:82:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
