WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct rss_container *' should also have an identifier name
#57: FILE: include/linux/rss_container.h:22:
+void container_out_of_memory(struct rss_container *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "rss"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
