Subject: [PATCH] ALPS: Add support for 4 directions button on Acer Aspire 5720

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#74: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/alps.c:32:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#138: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/alps.c:287:
+			    sizeof(alps_model_data[i].signature))) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*model_info)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct alps_model_info)...)
#139: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/alps.c:288:
+			model_info = kmalloc(sizeof(struct alps_model_info),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#143: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/alps.c:292:
