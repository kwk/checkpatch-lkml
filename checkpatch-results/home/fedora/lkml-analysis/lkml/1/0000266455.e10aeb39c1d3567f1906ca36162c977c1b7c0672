WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#88: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1016:
+static void xen_set_fixmap(unsigned idx, unsigned long phys, pgprot_t prot)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#164: FILE: include/asm-x86/paravirt.h:294:
+	/* Sometimes the physical address is a pfn, and sometimes its
+	   an mfn.  We can tell which is which from the index. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned' should also have an identifier name
#165: FILE: include/asm-x86/paravirt.h:295:
+	void (*set_fixmap)(unsigned /* enum fixed_addresses */ idx,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
