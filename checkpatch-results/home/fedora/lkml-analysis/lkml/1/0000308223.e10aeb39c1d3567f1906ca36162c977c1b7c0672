ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#69: 
--- a/drivers/char/n_tty.c	2008-01-24 16:58:37.000000000 -0600

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#81: FILE: drivers/char/n_tty.c:844:
+				int prev_head;
+				if (tty->read_head)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
