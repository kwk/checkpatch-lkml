commit edd7fc7003f31da48d06e215a93ea966a22c2a03 upstream.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath5k/ath5k.h:1167:
+extern int ath5k_hw_on_hold(struct ath5k_hw *ah);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#122: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath5k/base.c:2466:
+		 * leave it idle (keep MAC/BB on warm reset) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#164: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath5k/reset.c:283:

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.
