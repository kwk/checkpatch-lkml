WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#85: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:1912:
 static void __devinit pci_no_domains(void)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:164:
+extern int pci_resource_alignment(struct pci_dev *dev, int resno);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
