CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: include/net/addrconf.h:83:
+extern int			ipv6_dev_get_saddr(struct net *net,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#77: FILE: include/net/addrconf.h:84:
+extern int			ipv6_dev_get_saddr(struct net *net,
+					       struct net_device *dev,
