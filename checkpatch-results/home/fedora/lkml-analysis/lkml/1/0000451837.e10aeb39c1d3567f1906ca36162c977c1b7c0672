WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#36: 
#include sched.h in ipc.h.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/ipc.h:95:
+extern int copy_ipcs(unsigned long flags, struct task_struct *tsk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
