WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'possiblity' may be misspelled - perhaps 'possibility'?
#30: 
Recently there has been some discussion of the possiblity of reworking
                                               ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#55: 
--- a/fs/Kconfig	Thu Jun 28 13:49:43 2007 -0700

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 15)

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#280: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:176:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#282: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:178:
+	phys_addr = simple_strtoul(p + 9, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
