WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'beeing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'being'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#68: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c:418:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "type->name"
#96: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c:2654:
+	for (; type->name != NULL; type++)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#127: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_ids.c:132:
+struct nand_flash_dev nand_smartmedia_flash_ids[] = {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
