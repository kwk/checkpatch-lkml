Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!curr_map"
#129: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:390:
+				if (curr_map == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#159: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:419:
+			curr_map->map_ip = curr_map->unmap_ip = identity__map_ip;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!kmap"
#226: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1550:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#232: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1553:
+	kmap->map_ip	   = kmap->unmap_ip = identity__map_ip;
