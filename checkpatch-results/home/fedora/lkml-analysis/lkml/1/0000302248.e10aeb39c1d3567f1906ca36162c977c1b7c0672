Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#77: FILE: ctxbench.c:1:
+#include <sched.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#100: FILE: ctxbench.c:23:
+void shmparent(int shm, int semid, pid_t child);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#101: FILE: ctxbench.c:24:
+void do_cpubind(int cpu);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#238: FILE: ctxbench.c:508:
+/*****************************************************************
+ | cpu_bind - bind all tasks to a given cpu

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#250: FILE: ctxbench.c:520:
+		printf("%d: sched_setaffinity %d: %lxh\n",getpid(), ret, *((int*)&d));

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
