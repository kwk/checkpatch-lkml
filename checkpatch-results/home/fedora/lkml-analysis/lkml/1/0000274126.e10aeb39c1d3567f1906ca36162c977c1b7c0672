Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#233: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:1438:
+extern void ata_sff_pause(struct ata_port *ap);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
