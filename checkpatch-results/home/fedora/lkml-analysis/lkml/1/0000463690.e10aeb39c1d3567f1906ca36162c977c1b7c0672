CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:198:
+extern int select_nohz_load_balancer(int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#170: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2994:
+				BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#181: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3005:
+		if (atomic_read(&nohz.load_balancer) == -1) {
[...]
+		} else if (atomic_read(&nohz.load_balancer) == cpu)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
