#32: 
Nice is better distributed for waking tasks with a per-static-prio prio_level.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#108: FILE: kernel/sched.c:717:
+	if (p->static_prio < rq->best_static_prio) {
[...]
+		if (likely(p->policy != SCHED_BATCH))
[...]
+	} else if (p->static_prio == rq->best_static_prio)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
