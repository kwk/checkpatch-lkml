WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#88: FILE: mm/dmapool.c:136:
+	if (size == 0) {
[...]

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#114: FILE: mm/dmapool.c:198:
+		unsigned int next = offset + pool->size;
+		if (unlikely((next + pool->size) >= pool->allocation))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dma_pool_free', this function's name, in a string
#266: FILE: mm/dmapool.c:410:
+				dev_err(pool->dev, "dma_pool_free %s, dma %Lx "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:PRINTF_L: %Lx is non-standard C, use %llx

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
