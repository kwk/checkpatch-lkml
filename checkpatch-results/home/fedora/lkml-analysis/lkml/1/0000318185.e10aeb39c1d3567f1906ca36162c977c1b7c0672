#28: 
Factor out the gfp to alloc_flags mapping so it can be used in other places.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#96: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1535:
+	if (!wait) {
[...]
+	} else if (unlikely(rt_task(p)) && !in_interrupt())
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
