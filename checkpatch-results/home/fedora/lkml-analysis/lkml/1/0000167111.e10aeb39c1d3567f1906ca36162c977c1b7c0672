WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#14: 
Subject: [PATCH 33/43] drivers/net/tulip: fix sparse warning: symbol shadows

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#58: FILE: drivers/net/tulip/de4x5.c:3946:
+	int tmp = *((char *)&lp->srom + 19) * 3;
+	strncpy(name, (char *)&lp->srom + 26 + tmp, 8);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
