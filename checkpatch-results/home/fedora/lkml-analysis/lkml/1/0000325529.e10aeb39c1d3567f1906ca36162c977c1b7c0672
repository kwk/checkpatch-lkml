CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p"
#174: FILE: fs/dlm/midcomms.c:116:
+			if (p == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#182: FILE: fs/dlm/midcomms.c:122:
+		BUG_ON(lockspace != p->header.h_lockspace);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
