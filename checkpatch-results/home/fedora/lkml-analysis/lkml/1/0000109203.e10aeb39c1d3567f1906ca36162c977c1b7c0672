WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#103: FILE: drivers/char/pty.c:166:
+	/* We cannot take a sleeping reference here without deadlocking with

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ld"
#105: FILE: drivers/char/pty.c:168:
+	if (ld == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
