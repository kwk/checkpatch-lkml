> > > The system boots fine with 2.6.26-0.rc3.1mnb (Mandriva Cooker), but since rc4, I see a few squares of color, then a black screen and the console never comes back. This is independent of the resolution chosen when using vga=ask. The machine does boot and I can start X if I log in blindly. Only the F1 to F6 consoles are gone.
