WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#60: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#65: FILE: drivers/base/dma-coherent.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dev->dma_mem)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dma_coherent_mem)...)
#100: FILE: drivers/base/dma-coherent.c:36:
+	dev->dma_mem = kzalloc(sizeof(struct dma_coherent_mem), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#174: FILE: drivers/base/dma-coherent.c:110:
+int dma_alloc_from_coherent(struct device *dev, ssize_t size,
+				       dma_addr_t *dma_handle, void **ret)

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#215: FILE: drivers/base/dma-coherent.c:151:
+ * dma_release_from_coherent() - try to free the memory allocated from per-device coherent memory pool

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
