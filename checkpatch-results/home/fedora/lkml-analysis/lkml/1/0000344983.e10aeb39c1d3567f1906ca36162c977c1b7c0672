#29: 
Convert MPC i2c driver from being a platform_driver to an open firmware version. Error returns were improved. Routine names were changed from fsl_ to mpc_ to make them match the file name.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#227: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mpc.c:367:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "i2c-mpc.c: Failed to load driver for %s\n", info.driver_name);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

#314: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mpc.c:454:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
