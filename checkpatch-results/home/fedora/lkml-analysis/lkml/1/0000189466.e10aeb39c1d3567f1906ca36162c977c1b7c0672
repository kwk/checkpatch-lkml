WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after input_abs_bypass_init_data[]
#53: FILE: drivers/input/input.c:35:
+static __initdata unsigned int input_abs_bypass_init_data[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - void __init input_init_abs_bypass() should probably be void __init input_init_abs_bypass(void)
#85: FILE: drivers/input/input.c:1647:
+static void __init input_init_abs_bypass()

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#88: FILE: drivers/input/input.c:1650:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
