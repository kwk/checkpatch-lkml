#79: FILE: drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_base.h:203:
+	return (virt->vaddr == NULL); /* 0, !0... 0, error_code in future */

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#92: FILE: drivers/video/sis/sis_main.c:5790:
+		while((countvideo = countvideo->next) != NULL)
