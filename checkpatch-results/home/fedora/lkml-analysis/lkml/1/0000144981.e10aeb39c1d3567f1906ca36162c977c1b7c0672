The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_RO: Use DEVICE_ATTR_RO
#71: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtdcore.c:101:
+}

The DEVICE_ATTR_RO(name) helper macro can be used instead of
DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0444, name_show, NULL);

Note that the macro automatically appends _show to the named
attribute variable of the device for the show method.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#72: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtdcore.c:102:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(mtd_flags, S_IRUGO, mtd_flags_show, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
