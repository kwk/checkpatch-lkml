WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#44: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1709:
+ *  Force enable MSI mapping capability on HT bridges  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#65: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1730:
+static void __devinit nv_msi_ht_cap_quirk(struct pci_dev *dev) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#66: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1731:
+static void __devinit nv_msi_ht_cap_quirk(struct pci_dev *dev) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#69: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1734:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#72: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1737:
+ ^I */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#74: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1739:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'nv_msi_ht_cap_quirk', this function's name, in a string
#76: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1741:
+			"PCI: nv_msi_ht_cap_quirk didn't locate host bridge\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
