ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo __meminit  bar" should be "foo __meminit bar"
#160: FILE: arch/x86/mm/numa_64.c:148:
+int __meminit  __early_pfn_to_nid(unsigned long pfn)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
