Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#100: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-sched.c:1142:
+	printf(" Task              |  Runtime ms | Switches | Average delay ms | Maximum delay ms |\n");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
