Commit 33c2dca4957bd0da3e1af7b96d0758d97e708ef6 (trim file propagation

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'intepret' may be misspelled - perhaps 'interpret'?
#44: FILE: block/compat_ioctl.c:680:
+	/* These intepret arg as an unsigned long, not as a pointer,
 	         ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#45: FILE: block/compat_ioctl.c:681:
+	 * so we must not do compat_ptr() conversion. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
