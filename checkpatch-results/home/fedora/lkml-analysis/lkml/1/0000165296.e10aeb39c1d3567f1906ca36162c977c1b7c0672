#33: 
the following patch (against 2.6.29rc5) fixes a few issues in the smack/netlabel area :

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#150: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:665:
+	for ( ; temp_mask; temp_mask <<= 1, maskn++);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#167: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:708:
+	struct smk_netlbladdr *m;
+	if (smack_netlbladdrs == NULL) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!smack_netlbladdrs"
#167: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:708:
+	if (smack_netlbladdrs == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "m"
#177: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:718:
+	for (m = smack_netlbladdrs; m != NULL; m = m->smk_next) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!m->smk_next"
#178: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:719:

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
