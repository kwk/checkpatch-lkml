#47: 
If this has been solved before somewhere, please point me in that direction.  There are whole lot few changes in this series vs original kdb outside of the kdb core area.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#252: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:315:
+extern void __si_swapinfo(struct sysinfo *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct sysinfo *' should also have an identifier name
#252: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:315:
+extern void __si_swapinfo(struct sysinfo *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#304: FILE: kernel/kallsyms.c:523:
+	static struct kallsym_iter kdb_walk_kallsyms_iter;
+	if (*pos == 0) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#406: FILE: kernel/signal.c:2735:

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
