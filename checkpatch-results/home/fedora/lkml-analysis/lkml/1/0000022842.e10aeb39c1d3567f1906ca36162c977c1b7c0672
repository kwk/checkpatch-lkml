Based on commit 74638c8 for IDE subsystem.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#71: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:3237:
+				p.cycle = p.cyc8b = id[ATA_ID_EIDE_PIO];

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
