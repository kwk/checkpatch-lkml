The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#97: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1127:
+/* DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL,       PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL=
+/* DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_RESUME(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL,       PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL=

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
