Subject: [PATCH 701/701] Staging: comedi: Fix 80 characters limit and printk issues in skel.c

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#102: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/skel.c:402:
+	/* step 2: make sure trigger sources are unique and mutually compatible
+     */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'skel_ao_winsn', this function's name, in a string
#111: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/skel.c:534:
+	pr_info("skel_ao_winsn\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
