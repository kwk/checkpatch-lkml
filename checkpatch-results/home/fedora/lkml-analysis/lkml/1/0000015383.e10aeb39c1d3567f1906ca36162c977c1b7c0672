WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#112: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:857:
+	BUG_ON(bitmap_allocate_region(vb->dirty_map, offset >> PAGE_SHIFT, order));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
