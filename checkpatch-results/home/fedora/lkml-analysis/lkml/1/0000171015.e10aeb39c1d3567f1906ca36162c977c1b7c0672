#37: 
Subject: [PATCH] ide: move request type specific code from ide_end_drive_cmd() to callers (v2)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#216: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:167:
+		if (blk_pm_request(rq))
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#251: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1158:
+void ide_complete_task(ide_drive_t *, ide_task_t *, u8, u8);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
