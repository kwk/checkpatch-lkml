WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#39: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .8
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/mmu-hash64.h:300:
+extern void slb_set_size(u16 size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#172: FILE: arch/powerpc/mm/slb.c:257:
+	extern unsigned int *slb_compare_rr_to_size;

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#352: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:714:
+			ata_dev_printk(dev, KERN_WARNING, "device reported "
+				       "invalid CHS sector 0\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#447: FILE: drivers/input/joydev.c:506:
 
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#455: FILE: drivers/input/joydev.c:514:
+	switch (cmd & ~IOCSIZE_MASK) {
+

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "chan"
#665: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ath5k/base.c:2626:
+	ret = ath5k_hw_reset(ah, sc->opmode, sc->curchan, chan != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#690: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:2362:
 static void __devinit quirk_msi_intx_disable_bug(struct pci_dev *dev)

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#733: FILE: drivers/ps3/ps3stor_lib.c:59:
+	if (sbd->match_id == PS3_MATCH_ID_STOR_DISK
+		&& ps3_flash_workaround.disk_open

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#734: FILE: drivers/ps3/ps3stor_lib.c:60:

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#856: FILE: fs/udf/lowlevel.c:63:
+	if (ioctl_by_bdev(bdev, CDROM_LAST_WRITTEN, (unsigned long) &lblock) ||

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
