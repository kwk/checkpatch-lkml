CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#50: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-n800-flash.c:17:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'syncronous' may be misspelled - perhaps 'synchronous'?
#107: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-n800-flash.c:76:
+	/* Set syncronous read timings */
 	       ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void __iomem *' should also have an identifier name
#172: FILE: include/asm-arm/arch-omap/onenand.h:19:
+	int                     (*onenand_setup)(void __iomem *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
