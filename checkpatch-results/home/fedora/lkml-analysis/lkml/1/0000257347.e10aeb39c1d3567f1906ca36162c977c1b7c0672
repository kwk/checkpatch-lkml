CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/linkage.h> instead of <asm/linkage.h>
#48: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common_64.c:19:
+#include <asm/linkage.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
