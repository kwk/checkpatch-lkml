CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!edid"
#57: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_sdvo.c:1642:
+	if (edid == NULL && intel_sdvo_multifunc_encoder(intel_output)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u8' over 'uint8_t'

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
