WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#112: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic_32.c:409:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#124: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic_32.c:421:
+		memcpy(&affinity[i], &balance_irq_affinity_init,
+			 sizeof(struct balance_irq_affinity));

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#126: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic_32.c:423:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 120 exceeds 100 columns
#128: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic_32.c:425:
+DEFINE_DYN_ARRAY(balance_irq_affinity, sizeof(struct balance_irq_affinity), nr_irqs, PAGE_SIZE, irq_affinity_init_work);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#160: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic_32.c:1212:
+	BUG_ON((unsigned)irq >= nr_irqs);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#160: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic_32.c:1212:
+	BUG_ON((unsigned)irq >= nr_irqs);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#218: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic_64.c:158:
+DEFINE_DYN_ARRAY(irq_2_pin, sizeof(struct irq_pin_list), pin_map_size, sizeof(struct irq_pin_list), NULL);

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
