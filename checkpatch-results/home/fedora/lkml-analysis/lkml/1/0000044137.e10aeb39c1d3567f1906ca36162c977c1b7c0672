CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'vlan->dev == src'
#142: FILE: drivers/net/macvlan.c:175:
+			if ((vlan->dev == src) || !(vlan->mode & mode))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#176: FILE: drivers/net/macvlan.c:212:
+			/* flood only to VEPA ports, bridge ports
+			   already saw the frame */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
