+	u32 hi = 0, lo = 0;
+	rdmsr(MSR_PSTATE_CUR_LIMIT, hi, lo);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#229: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c:996:
+	if (pstate > data->max_hw_pstate);
 		return 0;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#229: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c:996:
+	if (pstate > data->max_hw_pstate);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
