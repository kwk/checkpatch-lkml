Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#183: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.c:130:
+		if (cache_type == PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_BPU && cache_op)
[...]
+		else if (cache_type == PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_BPU) {

+		} else if (cache_result)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
