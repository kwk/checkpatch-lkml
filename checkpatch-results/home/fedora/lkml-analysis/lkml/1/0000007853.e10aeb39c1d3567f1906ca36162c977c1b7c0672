CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/highmem.h:58:
+extern void *kmap_pfn_prot(unsigned long pfn, pgprot_t prot);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#73: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/highmem.h:91:
+# define kmap_atomic_prot(page, type, prot)	({ pagefault_disable(); kmap_pfn_prot(page_to_pfn(page), prot); })

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
