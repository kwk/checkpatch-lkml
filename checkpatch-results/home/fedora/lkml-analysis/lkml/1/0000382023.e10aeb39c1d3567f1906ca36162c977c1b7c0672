      via82cxxx: add Arima W730-K8 and other rebadgings to short cables list

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Satelite' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Satellite'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#154: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c		Version 1.12	Aug 19, 2007

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#236: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:557:
+		/* Fall thru */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#301: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1057:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!info->settings[clock]"
#318: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1144:
+	if (chip_type >= HPT374 || info->settings[clock] == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
