WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:194:
+extern struct irq_desc *irq_desc_without_new(unsigned int irq);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#125: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:157:
+	BUG_ON(irq == -1U);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <irq_descX>
#127: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:159:
+	desc = &irq_descX[0];

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#155: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:258:
 }
+struct irq_desc *irq_desc_without_new(unsigned int irq)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
