#14: 
Subject: [PATCH] Staging: wlan-ng: fixed multiple styling issues in prism2sta.c This is a patch to the prism2sta.c file that fixes multiple warnings generated by the checkpatch.pl tool, mostly related to the 80 character limit, though there were also a few related to having a space following the & operator. code has been refactored and no longer generates errors Signed-off-by: Jim Dog <jimdog@northern-indymedia.org>

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.
