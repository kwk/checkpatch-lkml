Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#69: FILE: fs/nfs/file.c:317:
+	struct vm_operations_struct *vm_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#70: FILE: fs/nfs/file.c:318:
+	struct vm_operations_struct *vm_ops;
+	vm_ops = &nfs_file_vm_ops;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
