WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pid_max_hw_breakpoint_handler', this function's name, in a string
#120: FILE: samples/hw_breakpoint/data_breakpoint.c:40:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "Dump stack from pid_max_hw_breakpoint_handler\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#133: FILE: samples/hw_breakpoint/data_breakpoint.c:53:
+	pid_max_hw_breakpoint.installed = (void*)pid_max_hw_breakpoint_installed;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#140: FILE: samples/hw_breakpoint/data_breakpoint.c:60:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
