WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#56: FILE: init/Kconfig:44:
+config DEPRECATED
+	bool "Prompt for deprecated code/drivers"
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  Code that has been tagged as "deprecated" generally still works and
+	  is probably still supported, but there is already a newer and better
+	  alternative available and you should seriously consider switching to
+	  that newer alternative.
+
+	  Code that is marked as deprecated for quite some time also has a
+	  tendency to eventually become "obsolete," at which point it will
+	  probably be removed entirely from the kernel.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#69: FILE: init/Kconfig:57:
+config OBSOLETE
+	bool "Prompt for obsolete code/drivers"
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  Code that has been tagged as "obsolete" is no longer officially
+	  supported and shouldn't play a part in any normal build.  Obsolete
+	  code might already be scheduled for removal as well, so you might
+	  want to check the file Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt for
+	  any proposed removal dates.
