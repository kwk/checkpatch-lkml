CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#106: FILE: kernel/irq/internals.h:13:
+extern int __irq_set_trigger(struct irq_desc *desc, unsigned int irq,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#107: FILE: kernel/irq/internals.h:14:
+extern int __irq_set_trigger(struct irq_desc *desc, unsigned int irq,
+		unsigned long flags);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#129: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:309:
+int __irq_set_trigger(struct irq_desc *desc, unsigned int irq,
 		unsigned long flags)

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#140: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:330:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
