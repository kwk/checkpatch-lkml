Andrew, there are suggested changes in the attached patch. Maybe merge it with

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'phantom_poll', this function's name, in a string
#94: FILE: drivers/misc/phantom.c:187:
+	pr_debug("phantom_poll: %d\n", atomic_read(&dev->counter));

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#97: FILE: drivers/misc/phantom.c:189:
+	if (atomic_read(&dev->counter)) {
[...]
+		atomic_dec(&dev->counter);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
