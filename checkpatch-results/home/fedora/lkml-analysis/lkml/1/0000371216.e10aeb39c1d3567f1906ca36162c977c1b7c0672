Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#65: FILE: fs/ufs/inode.c:704:
+	struct ufs_sb_private_info * uspi = UFS_SB(sb)->s_uspi;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#188: FILE: include/linux/ufs_fs.h:982:
+extern struct inode *ufs_iget (struct super_block *, unsigned long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct super_block *' should also have an identifier name
#188: FILE: include/linux/ufs_fs.h:982:
+extern struct inode *ufs_iget (struct super_block *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
