CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hwif"
#84: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1657:
+	if (hwif == NULL && (d->host_flags & IDE_HFLAG_SINGLE))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const struct ide_port_info *' should also have an identifier name
#202: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1218:
+int ide_legacy_device_add(const struct ide_port_info *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#202: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1218:
+int ide_legacy_device_add(const struct ide_port_info *, unsigned long);
