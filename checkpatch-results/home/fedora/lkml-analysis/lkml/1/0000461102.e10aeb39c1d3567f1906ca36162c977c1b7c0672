#98: 
      ide: make legacy IDE VLB modules check for the "probe" kernel params (v2)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#414: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:1742:
+				hwif->serialized = mate->serialized = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#449: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:1834:
+		extern int pmac_ide_probe(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#471: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/ali14xx.c:231:
+int probe_ali14xx = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#1405: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:702:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
