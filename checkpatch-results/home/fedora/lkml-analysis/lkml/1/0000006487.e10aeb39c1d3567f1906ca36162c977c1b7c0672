WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#24: 
Subject: [PATCH 62/66] arch/x86/kvm/kvm_timer.h: Checkpatch cleanup

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct kvm_timer *' should also have an identifier name
#50: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/kvm_timer.h:13:
+	bool (*is_periodic)(struct kvm_timer *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
