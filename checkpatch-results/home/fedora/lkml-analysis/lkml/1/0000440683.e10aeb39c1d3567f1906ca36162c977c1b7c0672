#44: 
Not sure if you prefer to wait Pierre work on futex64, so just in case, I prepared this patch.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'droped' may be misspelled - perhaps 'dropped'?
#48: 
- Rebased on linux-2.6.21-rc7-mm2 , since futex64 were droped from mm

#59: 
- Rebased on linux-2.6.21-rc6-mm1 + get_futex_key() must check proper alignement for 64bit futexes

- Added Rusty in CC since he may have to change drivers/lguest/io.c again, since get_futex_key() have yet another parameter (fshared). (I couldnt find this file in 2.6.21-rc6-mm1 tree)

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
