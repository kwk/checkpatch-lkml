WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#85: FILE: fs/nfs/mount_clnt.c:133:
+	unsigned size;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#113: FILE: fs/nfs/super.c:1252:
+		if (data->flags & NFS_MOUNT_VER3) {
[...]
-		else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!data"
#144: FILE: fs/nfs/super.c:1597:
+	if (data == NULL || mntfh == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
