CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#103: FILE: include/linux/device.h:150:
+extern int wait_for_device_probe(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

distractions when editing files.
