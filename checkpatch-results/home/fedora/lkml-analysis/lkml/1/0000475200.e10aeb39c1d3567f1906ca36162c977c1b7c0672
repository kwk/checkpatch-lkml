Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be

Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

+	u32 *count = (u32*)vma->vm_private_data;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#469: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_uverbs.c:100:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
