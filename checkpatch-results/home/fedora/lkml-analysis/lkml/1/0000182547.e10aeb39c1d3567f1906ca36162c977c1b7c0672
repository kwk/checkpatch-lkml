CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:320:
+extern int proc_dohung_task_timeout_secs(struct ctl_table *table, int write,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:DUPLICATED_SYSCTL_CONST: duplicated sysctl range checking value 'zero', consider using the shared one in include/linux/sysctl.h
#258: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:784:

Commit d91bff3011cf ("proc/sysctl: add shared variables for range
check") added some shared const variables to be used instead of a local
copy in each source file.

Consider replacing the sysctl range checking value with the shared
one in include/linux/sysctl.h.  The following conversion scheme may
be used::

  &zero     ->  SYSCTL_ZERO
  &one      ->  SYSCTL_ONE
  &int_max  ->  SYSCTL_INT_MAX
