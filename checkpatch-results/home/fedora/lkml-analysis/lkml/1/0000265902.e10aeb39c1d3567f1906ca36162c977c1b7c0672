WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#96: FILE: drivers/ata/ahci.c:407:
+		AHCI_HFLAGS	(AHCI_HFLAG_NO_PMP),

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_DEV_LEVEL: Prefer dev_info(... to dev_printk(KERN_INFO, ...

+		dev_printk(KERN_INFO, &pdev->dev,

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#211: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:2409:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#224: FILE: drivers/ata/libata.h:109:
+extern int atapi_check_dma(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#262: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_mv.c:1614:
+					": attempting PIO w/multiple DRQ: "
+					"this may fail due to h/w errata\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
