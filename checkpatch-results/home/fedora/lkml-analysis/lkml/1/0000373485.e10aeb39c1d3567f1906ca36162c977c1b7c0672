When a lot of IO, with some distributed mmap IO, is run on a GFS2 filesystem in

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#147: FILE: fs/gfs2/glock.c:464:
+	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(&gl->gl_spin));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#147: FILE: fs/gfs2/glock.c:464:
+	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(&gl->gl_spin));

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/locking/lockdep-design.html#annotations

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
