WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#66: FILE: fs/ocfs2/alloc.c:137:
+	BUG_ON(OCFS2_I(inode)->ip_dyn_features & OCFS2_INLINE_DATA_FL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#70: FILE: fs/ocfs2/alloc.c:141:
+			"Device %s, asking for sparse allocation: inode %llu, "
+			"cpos %u, clusters %u\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
