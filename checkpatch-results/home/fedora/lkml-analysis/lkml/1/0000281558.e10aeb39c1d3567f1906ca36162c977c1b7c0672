+config PM_TEST_SUSPEND

+	---help---
+	This option will suspend your machine during bootup, and make
+	it wake up a few seconds later using the RTC's wakeup alarm.
+
+	You probably want to have your system's RTC driver statically
+	linked, ensuring that it's available when this test runs.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
