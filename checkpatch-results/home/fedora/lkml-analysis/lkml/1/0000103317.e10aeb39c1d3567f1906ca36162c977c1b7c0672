CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1076:
+extern void zone_pcp_update(struct zone *zone);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#79: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:3140:
+	for (cpu = 0; cpu < NR_CPUS; cpu++) {
