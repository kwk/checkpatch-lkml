#29: 
This version of TOMOYO assigns only one variable "struct tomoyo_domain_info *"

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'cource' may be misspelled - perhaps 'course'?
#45: 
Of cource, if TOMOYO is allowed to add "u32" to "struct task_struct",
   ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#59: FILE: security/tomoyo/tomoyo.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#60: FILE: security/tomoyo/tomoyo.c:2:
+ * security/tomoyo/tomoyo.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'sharable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'shareable'?
#79: FILE: security/tomoyo/tomoyo.c:21:
+	 * Since "struct tomoyo_domain_info *" is a sharable pointer,
