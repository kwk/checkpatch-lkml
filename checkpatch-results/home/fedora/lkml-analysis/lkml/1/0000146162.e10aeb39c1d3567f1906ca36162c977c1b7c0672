ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#79: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/kerneltop.c:186:
+static unsigned int		realtime_prio			=  0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#103: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/kerneltop.c:640:
+	events = userspace_events = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#164: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/kerneltop.c:1143:
+		case 'r': realtime_prio			=   atoi(optarg); break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
