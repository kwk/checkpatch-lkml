Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Not-yet-signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#70: 
Not-yet-Signed-off-by: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#87: FILE: arch/x86/mm/hugetlbpage.c:209:
+	pmd_t unhuge_pmd = __pmd(pmd_val(pmd) & ~(_PAGE_PSE | _PAGE_NX));
+	if (pmd_bad(unhuge_pmd))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
