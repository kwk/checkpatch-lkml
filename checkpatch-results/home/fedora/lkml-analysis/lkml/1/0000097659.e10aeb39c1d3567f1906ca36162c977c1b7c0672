#38: 
Ensures correct concurrent opening/reading of pidlists across pid namespaces

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: struct mutex definition without comment
#112: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:219:
+	struct mutex pidlist_mutex;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#137: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:648:
+	BUG_ON(!list_empty(&cgrp->pidlists));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*l)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct cgroup_pidlist)...)
#186: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2209:
+	l = kmalloc(sizeof(struct cgroup_pidlist), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#229: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2266:
+	if (type == CGROUP_FILE_PROCS) {
 		length = pidlist_uniq(&array, length);
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
