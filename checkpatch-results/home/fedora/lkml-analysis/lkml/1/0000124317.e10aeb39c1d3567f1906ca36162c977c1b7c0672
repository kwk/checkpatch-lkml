Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#183: FILE: arch/mips/loongson/common/mfgpt.c:48:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#375: FILE: arch/mips/loongson/common/mfgpt.c:230:
+	if (count > old_count && jifs == old_jifs) {
+		count = old_count;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#414: FILE: arch/mips/loongson/common/time.c:23:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
