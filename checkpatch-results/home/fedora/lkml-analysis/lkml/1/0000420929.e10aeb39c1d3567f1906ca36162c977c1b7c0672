ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#71: FILE: net/core/sock.c:211:
+		static int warned = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#75: FILE: net/core/sock.c:215:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "sock_set_timeout: `%s' (pid %d) "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'sock_set_timeout', this function's name, in a string
#75: FILE: net/core/sock.c:215:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "sock_set_timeout: `%s' (pid %d) "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#76: FILE: net/core/sock.c:216:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "sock_set_timeout: `%s' (pid %d) "
+			       "tries to set negative timeout\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
