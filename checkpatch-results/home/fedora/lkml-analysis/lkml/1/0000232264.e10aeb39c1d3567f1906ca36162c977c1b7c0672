WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#63: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#68: FILE: cpt/restart.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#92: FILE: cpt/restart.c:25:
+	struct cpt_object_hdr *hdr = tmp;
+	err = ctx->read(hdr, sizeof(struct cpt_object_hdr), ctx);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#130: FILE: cpt/restart.c:63:
+	if (KERNEL_VERSION(hdr.cpt_image_major, hdr.cpt_image_minor,
+				hdr.cpt_image_sublevel) != LINUX_VERSION_CODE)

WARNING:LINUX_VERSION_CODE: LINUX_VERSION_CODE should be avoided, code should be for the version to which it is merged
#130: FILE: cpt/restart.c:63:
+				hdr.cpt_image_sublevel) != LINUX_VERSION_CODE)

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#135: FILE: cpt/restart.c:68:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/
