WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#45: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#50: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#106: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:57:
+	input_dev->keybit[BIT_WORD(BTN_MOUSE)] = BIT_MASK(BTN_LEFT) | BIT_MASK(BTN_RIGHT) | BIT_MASK(BTN_MIDDLE);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#117: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:68:
+	maple_getcond_callback(mdev, dc_mouse_callback, HZ/50, MAPLE_FUNC_MOUSE);
 	                                                  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#151: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:102:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'mdev->driver == &dc_mouse_driver'
#177: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:128:
+	if ((mdev->function & MAPLE_FUNC_MOUSE)
+		&& (mdev->driver == &dc_mouse_driver))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#178: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:129:
+	if ((mdev->function & MAPLE_FUNC_MOUSE)
+		&& (mdev->driver == &dc_mouse_driver))
