CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#354: FILE: arch/arm/mach-at91/include/mach/board.h:75:
+extern void __init at91_add_device_mci(short mmc_id, struct mci_platform_data *data);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
