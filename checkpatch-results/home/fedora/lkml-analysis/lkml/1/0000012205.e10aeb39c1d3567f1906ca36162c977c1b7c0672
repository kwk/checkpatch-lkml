WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'do'
#39: 
Although nand_do_write_ops intends to allow such mode, it fails do do so

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'attemts' may be misspelled - perhaps 'attempts'?
#42: 
Also add missing checks for attemts to write at illegal offsets.
                            ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
