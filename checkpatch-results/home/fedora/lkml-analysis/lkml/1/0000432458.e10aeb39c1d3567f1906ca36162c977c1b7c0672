CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#181: FILE: arch/i386/xen/enlighten.c:810:
+	start = end = reloc = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
