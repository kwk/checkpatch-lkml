WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'stop_ptraced_child', this function's name, in a string
#74: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/start_up.c:126:
+		perror("stop_ptraced_child : ptrace failed");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'check_sysemu', this function's name, in a string

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#111: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/start_up.c:264:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
