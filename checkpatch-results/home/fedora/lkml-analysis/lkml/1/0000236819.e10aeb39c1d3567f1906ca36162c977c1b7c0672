#38: 
A vcpu_down request from the remote admin via Xenbus both hotunplugs the CPU, and disables it by removing it from the cpu_present map, and removing its entry in /sys

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#163: FILE: arch/x86/xen/smp.c:339:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#225: FILE: arch/x86/xen/time.c:458:
+	BUG_ON(cpu == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#273: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#278: FILE: drivers/xen/cpu_hotplug.c:1:
+#include <linux/notifier.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.
