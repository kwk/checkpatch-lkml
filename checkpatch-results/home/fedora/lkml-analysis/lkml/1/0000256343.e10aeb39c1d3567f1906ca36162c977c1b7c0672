#30: 
Clean up the intel-iommu code related to deferred iommu flush logic. There is

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#55: FILE: drivers/pci/dmar.c:385:
+	static int iommu_allocated = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#163: FILE: drivers/pci/intel-iommu.h:202:
+extern struct intel_iommu *alloc_iommu(struct dmar_drhd_unit *drhd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
