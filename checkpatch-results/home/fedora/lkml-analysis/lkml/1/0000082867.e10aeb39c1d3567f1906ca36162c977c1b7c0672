Revert commit 8827c288feb7810185aa7c2e37537202fc709869

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#122: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2438:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#144: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2463:
+			if (cgrp->tasks_pids[mid] == pid) {
[...]
-			} else if (cp->tasks_pids[mid] <= pid)
[...]
 				index = mid + 1;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#199: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:2521:
+	BUG_ON(!cgrp->pids_use_count);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
