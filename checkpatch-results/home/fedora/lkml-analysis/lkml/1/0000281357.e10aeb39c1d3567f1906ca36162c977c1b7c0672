#56: 
if the transport timer wakes at the exact same time we are supposed to check

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#103: FILE: drivers/scsi/libiscsi.c:1380:
+	if (time_before_eq(last_recv + recv_timeout, jiffies)) {
[...]
+		next_timeout = conn->last_ping + (conn->ping_timeout * HZ);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
