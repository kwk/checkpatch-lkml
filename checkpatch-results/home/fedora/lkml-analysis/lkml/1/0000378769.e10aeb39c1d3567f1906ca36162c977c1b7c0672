Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#109: FILE: kernel/module.c:47:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "mod->exit"
#139: FILE: kernel/module.c:724:
+	if (mod->exit != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#195: FILE: kernel/module.c:856:
+	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&module_unload_inhibit_cnt) < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
