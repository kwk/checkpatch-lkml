#62: FILE: fs/ext3/ialloc.c:572:
+ ^Iei->i_flags = EXT3_I(dir)->i_flags & ~(EXT3_INDEX_FL | EXT3_RTIME_FL);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#109: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:2396:
+	 * notified parent during unlink... */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:ENOTSUPP: ENOTSUPP is not a SUSV4 error code, prefer EOPNOTSUPP
#164: FILE: fs/ext3/ioctl.c:33:

ENOTSUPP is not a standard error code and should be avoided in new patches.
EOPNOTSUPP should be used instead.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
