CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#54: FILE: fs/ext4/mballoc.c:914:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#91: FILE: fs/ext4/mballoc.c:951:
+		BUG_ON(page->mapping != inode->i_mapping);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!page"
#99: FILE: fs/ext4/mballoc.c:959:
+	if (page == NULL || !PageUptodate(page)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
