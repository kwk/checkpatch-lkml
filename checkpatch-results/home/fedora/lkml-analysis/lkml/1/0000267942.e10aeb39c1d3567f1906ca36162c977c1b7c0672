CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT_ULL macro
#150: FILE: arch/x86/pci/amd_bus.c:538:
+#define ENABLE_CF8_EXT_CFG      (1ULL << 46)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#155: FILE: arch/x86/pci/amd_bus.c:543:
+	u64 reg;
+	rdmsrl(MSR_AMD64_NB_CFG, reg);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#165: FILE: arch/x86/pci/amd_bus.c:553:
+        if (boot_cpu_data.x86 < 0x10)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#165: FILE: arch/x86/pci/amd_bus.c:553:

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#192: FILE: arch/x86/pci/direct.c:272:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#193: FILE: arch/x86/pci/direct.c:273:

+		       "for extended access\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
