WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#152: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event.c:1528:
+	if ((p4_is_ht_slave(hwc->config) ^ p4_ht_thread(cpu))) {
+		/* FIXME: swap them here */
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
