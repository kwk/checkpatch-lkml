The driver is configurable by supplying a struct with the platform data. See

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct backlight_ops should normally be const
#198: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/atmel-pwm-bl.c:116:
+static struct backlight_ops atmel_pwm_bl_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pwmbl)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct atmel_pwm_bl)...)
#210: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/atmel-pwm-bl.c:128:
+	pwmbl = kzalloc(sizeof(struct atmel_pwm_bl), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
