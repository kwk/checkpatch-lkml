CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'sma' may be better as '(sma)' to avoid precedence issues
#122: FILE: ipc/sem.c:92:
+#define sem_checkid(sma, semid)	ipc_checkid(&sma->sem_perm, semid)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#141: FILE: ipc/sem.c:1387:
+		BUG_ON(sem_checkid(sma, u->semid));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
