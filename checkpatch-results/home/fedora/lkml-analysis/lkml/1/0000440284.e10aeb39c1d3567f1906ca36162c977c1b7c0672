WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#20: 
The next revision of POSIX will support fine-grained filesystem timestamps the way we already support.  struct stat will report nanosecond values.  So far so good.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#75: FILE: fs/compat.c:94:
+asmlinkage long compat_sys_utimensat(unsigned int dfd, char __user *filename, struct compat_timespec __user *t)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#173: FILE: fs/utimes.c:140:
+	struct timespec tstimes[2];
+	if (utimes) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#204: FILE: fs/utimes.c:171:
+		/* This test is needed to catch all invalid values.  If we

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#276: FILE: include/linux/time.h:112:
+extern long do_utimes(int dfd, char __user *filename, struct timespec *times);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
