Subject: [PATCH 8/8] x86: fix sparse warnings in acpi/bus.c

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name
#98: FILE: include/asm-x86/acpi.h:94:
+void acpi_pic_sci_set_trigger(unsigned int, u16);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'u16' should also have an identifier name
#98: FILE: include/asm-x86/acpi.h:94:
+void acpi_pic_sci_set_trigger(unsigned int, u16);
