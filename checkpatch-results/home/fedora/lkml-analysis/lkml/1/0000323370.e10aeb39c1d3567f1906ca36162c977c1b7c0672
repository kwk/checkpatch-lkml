WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#22: 
Subject: Re: bug in checkpatch (on pointers to typedefs?)

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
