CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#226: FILE: include/linux/pid.h:123:
+extern pid_t __pid_nr(struct pid_namespace *ns, struct pid *pid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#258: FILE: kernel/pid.c:319:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#260: FILE: kernel/pid.c:321:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(__pid_nr);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
