CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#83: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:43:
+extern void pci_update_current_state(struct pci_dev *dev, pci_power_t state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#168: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:410:
+		dev_warn(&pci_dev->dev, "unable to restore config, "
+			"bridge %s in low power state D%d\n", pci_name(parent),

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
