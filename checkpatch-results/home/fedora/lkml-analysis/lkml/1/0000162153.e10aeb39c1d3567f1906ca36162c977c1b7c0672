WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#67: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/perf_counter.c:827:
+extern struct power_pmu power5_pmu;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#82: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#87: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/power5-pmu.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#219: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/power5-pmu.c:133:
+static u64 unit_cons[PM_LASTUNIT+1][2] = {
                                 ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '?' (ctx:VxW)
#265: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/power5-pmu.c:179:
+			fmask = (bit == 6)? 7: 3;
 			                  ^

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that ':' (ctx:VxW)
#265: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/power5-pmu.c:179:
+			fmask = (bit == 6)? 7: 3;
 			                     ^

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#396: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/power5-pmu.c:310:
+	pmc_grp_use[0] = pmc_grp_use[1] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <MMCR0_PMCjCE>
#529: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/power5-pmu.c:443:
+		mmcr[0] |= MMCR0_PMCjCE;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#546: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/power5-pmu.c:460:
+^I[PERF_COUNT_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS] = 0x230e4,^I/* BR_ISSUED */ $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
