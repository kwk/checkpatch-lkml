CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#155: FILE: include/asm-x86/e820_64.h:44:
+extern void reserve_early(unsigned long start, unsigned long end, char *name);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
