#106: FILE: drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c:332:
+int acpi_processor_suspend(struct acpi_device * device, pm_message_t state)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
