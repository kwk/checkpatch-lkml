#30: 
seqcount update: fixed by taking i_lock around i_size_write when 32-bit SMP.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#125: FILE: include/linux/fs_stack.h:24:
+extern void fsstack_copy_inode_size(struct inode *dst, struct inode *src);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
