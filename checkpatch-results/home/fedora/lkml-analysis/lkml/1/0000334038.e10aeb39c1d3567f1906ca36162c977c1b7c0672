WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#131: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#136: FILE: kernel/power/sleepy.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#138: FILE: kernel/power/sleepy.c:3:
+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/percpu.h> instead of <asm/percpu.h>
#158: FILE: kernel/power/sleepy.c:23:
+#include <asm/percpu.h>

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#162: FILE: kernel/power/sleepy.c:27:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#164: FILE: kernel/power/sleepy.c:29:
+extern int cmos_set_alarm(struct device *dev, struct rtc_wkalrm *t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#165: FILE: kernel/power/sleepy.c:30:
+extern int cmos_read_time(struct device *dev, struct rtc_time *t);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
