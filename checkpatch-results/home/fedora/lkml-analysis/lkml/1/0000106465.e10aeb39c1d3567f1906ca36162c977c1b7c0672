CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#52: FILE: fs/nfs/super.c:2553:
+	char *page = (char *) __get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!page"
#55: FILE: fs/nfs/super.c:2556:
+	if (page == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#58: FILE: fs/nfs/super.c:2559:
+	devname = nfs_path(path->mnt->mnt_devname,
+			path->mnt->mnt_root, path->dentry,

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!devname"
#60: FILE: fs/nfs/super.c:2561:
+	if (devname == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tmp"
#63: FILE: fs/nfs/super.c:2564:
+	if (tmp == NULL)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#79: FILE: fs/nfs/super.c:2599:
+	nfs_fix_devname(&nd.path, mnt_target);
