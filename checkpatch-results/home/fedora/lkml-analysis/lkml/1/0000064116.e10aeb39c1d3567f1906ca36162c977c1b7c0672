WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'post', this function's name, in a string
#118: FILE: arch/x86/mm/mmio-mod.c:217:
+		pr_emerg("unexpected post handler");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#221: FILE: arch/x86/mm/mmio-mod.c:437:
+		pr_warning("multiple CPUs are online, may miss events. "
+			   "Suggest booting with maxcpus=1 kernel argument.\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
