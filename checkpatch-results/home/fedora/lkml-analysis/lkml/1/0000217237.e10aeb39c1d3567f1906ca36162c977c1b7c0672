CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:162:
+extern struct pci_bus *pci_alloc_child_bus(struct pci_bus *parent,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#61: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:163:
+extern struct pci_bus *pci_alloc_child_bus(struct pci_bus *parent,
+				struct pci_dev *bridge, int busnr);
