WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#123: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dir.c:236:
+		BUG_ON(!(flags & OCFS2_BH_READAHEAD));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#187: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dir.c:336:
+			 * ocfs2_read_dir_block() has released the bh. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
