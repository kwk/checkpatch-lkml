CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#141: FILE: drivers/serial/atmel_serial.c:304:
 			     || atmel_port->break_active)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#330: FILE: drivers/serial/atmel_serial.c:493:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
