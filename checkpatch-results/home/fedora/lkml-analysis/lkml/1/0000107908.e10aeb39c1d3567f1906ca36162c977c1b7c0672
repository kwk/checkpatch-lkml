#40: 
Identity mapping for IOMMU defines a single domain to 1:1 map all pci devices

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'creats' may be misspelled - perhaps 'creates'?
#81: FILE: drivers/pci/intel-iommu.c:226:
+ *	1. This domain creats a static 1:1 mapping to all usable memory.
   	               ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#82: FILE: drivers/pci/intel-iommu.c:227:
+ * ^I2. It maps to each iommu if successful.$

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#115: FILE: drivers/pci/intel-iommu.c:461:
+	BUG_ON(domain->flags & ~DOMAIN_FLAG_SINGLE_DEVICE);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
