Instead of just adding another one to the task struct I combined them all into

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#87: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1230:
+ ^I * Deadlock detection and priority inheritance handling,$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "task->blocked_on"
#146: FILE: kernel/mutex-debug.c:78:
+	DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(task->blocked_on != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#182: FILE: kernel/mutex.c:136:
+	struct lock_waiter_state lock_waiter =
+		{ .lock_type = MUTEX_WAITER, { .mutex_blocked_on = &waiter} };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
