IMO this one should get restructured and make use of acpi_bus_register_driver

WARNING:STATIC_CONST: Move const after static - use 'static const struct acpi_device_id '

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
