+	tristate "APM (Advanced Power Management) BIOS support"
+	depends on X86_32 && PM_SLEEP && !X86_VISWS
+	---help---
+	  APM is a BIOS specification for saving power using several different
+	  techniques. This is mostly useful for battery powered laptops with
+	  APM compliant BIOSes. If you say Y here, the system time will be
+	  reset after a RESUME operation, the /proc/apm device will provide
+	  battery status information, and user-space programs will receive
+	  notification of APM "events" (e.g. battery status change).
+
+	  If you select "Y" here, you can disable actual use of the APM
+	  BIOS by passing the "apm=off" option to the kernel at boot time.
+
+	  Note that the APM support is almost completely disabled for
+	  machines with more than one CPU.
+
+	  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location
+	  and more information, read <file:Documentation/pm.txt> and the
+	  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
+	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.
+
+	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)
+	  manpage ("man 8 hdparm") for that), and it doesn't turn off
+	  VESA-compliant "green" monitors.
+
+	  This driver does not support the TI 4000M TravelMate and the ACER
+	  486/DX4/75 because they don't have compliant BIOSes. Many "green"
+	  desktop machines also don't have compliant BIOSes, and this driver
+	  may cause those machines to panic during the boot phase.
+
+	  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't
+	  much point in using this driver and you should say N. If you get
+	  random kernel OOPSes or reboots that don't seem to be related to
+	  anything, try disabling/enabling this option (or disabling/enabling
+	  APM in your BIOS).
+
+	  Some other things you should try when experiencing seemingly random,
+	  "weird" problems:
+
+	  1) make sure that you have enough swap space and that it is
+	  enabled.
+	  2) pass the "no-hlt" option to the kernel
+	  3) switch on floating point emulation in the kernel and pass
+	  the "no387" option to the kernel
+	  4) pass the "floppy=nodma" option to the kernel
+	  5) pass the "mem=4M" option to the kernel (thereby disabling
+	  all but the first 4 MB of RAM)
+	  6) make sure that the CPU is not over clocked.
+	  7) read the sig11 FAQ at <http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/>
+	  8) disable the cache from your BIOS settings
+	  9) install a fan for the video card or exchange video RAM
+	  10) install a better fan for the CPU
+	  11) exchange RAM chips
+	  12) exchange the motherboard.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called apm.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#126: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:74:
+config APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND
+	bool "Ignore USER SUSPEND"
+	help
+	  This option will ignore USER SUSPEND requests. On machines with a
+	  compliant APM BIOS, you want to say N. However, on the NEC Versa M
+	  series notebooks, it is necessary to say Y because of a BIOS bug.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#133: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:81:
+config APM_DO_ENABLE
+	bool "Enable PM at boot time"
+	---help---
+	  Enable APM features at boot time. From page 36 of the APM BIOS
+	  specification: "When disabled, the APM BIOS does not automatically
+	  power manage devices, enter the Standby State, enter the Suspend
+	  State, or take power saving steps in response to CPU Idle calls."
+	  This driver will make CPU Idle calls when Linux is idle (unless this
+	  feature is turned off -- see "Do CPU IDLE calls", below). This
+	  should always save battery power, but more complicated APM features
+	  will be dependent on your BIOS implementation. You may need to turn
+	  this option off if your computer hangs at boot time when using APM
+	  support, or if it beeps continuously instead of suspending. Turn
+	  this off if you have a NEC UltraLite Versa 33/C or a Toshiba
+	  T400CDT. This is off by default since most machines do fine without
+	  this feature.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
