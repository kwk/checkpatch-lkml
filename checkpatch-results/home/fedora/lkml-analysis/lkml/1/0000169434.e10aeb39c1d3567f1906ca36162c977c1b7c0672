CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around '&next_i->i_sb_list != list'

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#152: FILE: include/linux/fsnotify_backend.h:233:
+extern void fsnotify_unmount_inodes(struct list_head *list);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
