ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#82: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:578:
+	struct inode * inode = NULL;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
