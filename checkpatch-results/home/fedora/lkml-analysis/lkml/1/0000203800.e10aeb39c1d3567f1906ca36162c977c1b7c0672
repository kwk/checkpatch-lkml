#40: 
duplication of PFNs from occuring and add checks to make sure that
                         ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*new_ext)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct mem_extent)...)
#223: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:342:
+			new_ext = kzalloc(sizeof(struct mem_extent), gfp_mask);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
