Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#79: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:112:
+__nfs_page_find_request_locked(struct nfs_inode *nfsi, struct page *page,
+		int get)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#91: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:120:
+		req = radix_tree_lookup(&nfsi->nfs_page_tree,
+				page_file_index(page));

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "req"
#118: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:147:
+	return req != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
