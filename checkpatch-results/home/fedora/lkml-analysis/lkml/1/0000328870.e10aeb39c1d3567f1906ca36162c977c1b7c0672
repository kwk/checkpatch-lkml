Subject: [PATCH] x86: fix sparse warnings in intel_cacheinfo.c

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;
