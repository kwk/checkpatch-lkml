CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#91: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-eh.c:2024:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#104: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-eh.c:2135:
+	/*if (ehc->i.flags & ATA_EHI_QUIET)
+		return;*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#141: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-eh.c:3374:
+				ata_dev_printk(qc->dev, KERN_INFO, "XXX retrying qc%d (bogus SENSE)\n", tag);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

+		printk("XXX scsi_eh_flush_done_q: online=%d(%d) noretry=%d retries=%d allowed=%d\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'scsi_eh_flush_done_q', this function's name, in a string
#153: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c:1572:
+		printk("XXX scsi_eh_flush_done_q: online=%d(%d) noretry=%d retries=%d allowed=%d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
