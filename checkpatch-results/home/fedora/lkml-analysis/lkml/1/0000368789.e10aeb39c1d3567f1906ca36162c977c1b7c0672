ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#106: FILE: drivers/cpuidle/cpuidle.c:271:
+        pm_qos_add_notifier(PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY, n);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'comparitor' may be misspelled - perhaps 'comparator'?
#202: FILE: kernel/pm_qos_params.c:80:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#215: FILE: kernel/pm_qos_params.c:93:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#219: FILE: kernel/pm_qos_params.c:97:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
