WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#93: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#98: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-s35390a.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

+		"mon=%d, year=%d, wday=%d\n", __FUNCTION__, tm->tm_sec,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*s35390a)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct s35390a)...)
#308: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-s35390a.c:211:
+	s35390a = kzalloc(sizeof(struct s35390a), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
