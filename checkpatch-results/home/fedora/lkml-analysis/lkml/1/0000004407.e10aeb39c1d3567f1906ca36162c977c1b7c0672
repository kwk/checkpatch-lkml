Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#163: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1262:
+}
+/*

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#230: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1316:
+	if (locked)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#232: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1318:
+	else {

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'addtion' may be misspelled - perhaps 'addition'?
#247: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1333:
+	 * in addtion to waiters on 01. We use global waitq for avoiding mess.
 	      ^^^^^^^

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#277: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1522:
