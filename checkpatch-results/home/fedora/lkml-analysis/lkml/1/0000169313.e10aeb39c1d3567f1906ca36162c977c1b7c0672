WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#57: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/generic.c:400:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "mtrr: BIOS set mask_lo: %x should be %x, fixing it up\n", mask_lo, tmp);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
