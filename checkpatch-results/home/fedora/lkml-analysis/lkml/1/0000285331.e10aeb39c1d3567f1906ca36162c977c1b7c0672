WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'non-existant' may be misspelled - perhaps 'non-existent'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#224: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:527:
+extern dev_t blk_lookup_devt(const char *name, int part);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#268: FILE: init/do_mounts.c:124:
+	part = simple_strtoul(p, NULL, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
