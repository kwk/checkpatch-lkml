The following changes since commit 0ca0f16fd17c5d880dd0abbe03595b0c7c5b3c95:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#308: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse.c:866:
+		pr_info("No spare slots, try to append...take your risk, "
+			"new mpc_length %x\n", count);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#312: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse.c:870:
+			pr_info("No spare slots, try to append..., "
+				"new mpc_length %x\n", count);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#313: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse.c:871:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#315: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse.c:873:
+			pr_err("mpc_new_length %lx is too small\n",
+				mpc_new_length);
