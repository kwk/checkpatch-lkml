Since tty_do_resize() cannot be called holding the hp spinlock; the code uses

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'hp->ws.ws_row != ws.ws_row'
#170: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_console.c:692:
+	if ((hp->ws.ws_row != ws.ws_row) || (hp->ws.ws_col != ws.ws_col)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#211: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_console.h:91:
+extern void hvc_resize(struct hvc_struct *hp, struct winsize ws);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
