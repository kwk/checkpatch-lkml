CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#69: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:2364:
+	if (!rq->bio)
[...]
+	else if (!ll_back_merge_fn(q, rq, bio))
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#143: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:678:
+extern int blk_rq_append_bio(struct request_queue *q, struct request *rq,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
