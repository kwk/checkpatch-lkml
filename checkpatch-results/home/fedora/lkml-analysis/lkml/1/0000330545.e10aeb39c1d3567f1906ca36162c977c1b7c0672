The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __printf(1, 2) over __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2)))
#60: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:135:
+	__attribute__ ((NORET_AND format (printf, 1, 2))) __cold;

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#62: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:137:
+# define softpanic(...) do { panic(__VA_ARGS__); } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#74: FILE: init/Kconfig:529:
+config SOFTPANIC
+	bool "Enable softpanic for boot errors" if EMBEDDED
+	default y
+	help
+		Enabling this option changes a hard panic on boot errors to a
+		soft panic, which does not stop the system completely.
+		You can still scroll the screen and read the messages.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#141: FILE: kernel/panic.c:152:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
