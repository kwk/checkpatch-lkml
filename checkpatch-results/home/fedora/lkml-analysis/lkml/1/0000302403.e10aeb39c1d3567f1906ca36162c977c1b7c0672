CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#93: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/sparsemem.h:18:
+extern int remove_section_mapping(unsigned long start, unsigned long end);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
