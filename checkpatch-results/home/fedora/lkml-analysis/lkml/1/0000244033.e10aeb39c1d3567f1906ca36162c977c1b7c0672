CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#77: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common_64.c:620:
+			orig_ist->ist[v] = t->x86_tss.ist[v] =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
