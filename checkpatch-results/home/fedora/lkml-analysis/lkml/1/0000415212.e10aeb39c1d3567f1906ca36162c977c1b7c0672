ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#66: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:153:
+unsigned int max_delegations = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#91: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:3210:
+	max_delegations = (unsigned int) sys.totalram;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
