WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#174: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode.c:431:
+	for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++)

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#189: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode_intel.c:129:
+extern struct ucode_work_info ucode_work_info[NR_CPUS];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#307: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode_intel.c:522:
+                /*$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
