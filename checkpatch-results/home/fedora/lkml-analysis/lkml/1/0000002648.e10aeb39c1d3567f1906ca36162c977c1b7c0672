CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#102: FILE: drivers/usb/core/hcd.h:321:
+extern void usb_hcd_poll_irq(struct usb_device *udev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#124: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/console.c:203:
+				 const char *buf, unsigned count)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#130: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/console.c:209:
+	/* pass on to the driver specific version of this function if
+	   it is available */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#130: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/console.c:209:
+	   it is available */

CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#140: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/console.c:219:
+		udelay(100);

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/timers/timers-howto.html#delays-information-on-the-various-kernel-delay-sleep-mechanisms

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#227: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/pl2303.c:458:
+			dev_err(&port->dev, "%s - failed submitting write urb,"
+				" error %d\n", __func__, result);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
