+	  Say yes here to support the Generic IRQ for the PCA9539 on-chip
+	  GPIO lines. Only pin-changed IRQs (IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH) are
+	  supported in hardware.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#224: FILE: drivers/gpio/pca9539.c:288:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
