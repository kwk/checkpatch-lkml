CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#209: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1431:
+	disk = lo->lo_disk = alloc_disk(1);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!lo"
#258: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1474:
+	if (lo == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#276: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1492:
+	blk_register_region(MKDEV(LOOP_MAJOR, 0), 1UL << MINORBITS,
+				  THIS_MODULE, loop_probe, NULL, NULL);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
