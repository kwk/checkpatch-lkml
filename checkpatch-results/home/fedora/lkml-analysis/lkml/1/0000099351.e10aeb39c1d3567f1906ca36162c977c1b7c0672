A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#105: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/ibmphp.h:754:
+extern int ibmphp_update_slot_info (struct slot *);	/* This function is called from HPC, so we need it to not be static */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct slot *' should also have an identifier name
#105: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/ibmphp.h:754:
+extern int ibmphp_update_slot_info (struct slot *);	/* This function is called from HPC, so we need it to not be static */

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
