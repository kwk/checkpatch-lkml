CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#138: FILE: fs/ubifs/file.c:794:
+	ui->read_in_a_row = ui->bulk_read = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*bu)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct bu_info)...)
#180: FILE: fs/ubifs/file.c:843:
+	bu = kmalloc(sizeof(struct bu_info), GFP_NOFS | __GFP_NOWARN);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'maxumum' may be misspelled - perhaps 'maximum'?
#240: FILE: fs/ubifs/tnc.c:1509:
+ * maxumum possible amount of nodes for bulk-read.
