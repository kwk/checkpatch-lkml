ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#56: FILE: tools/perf/util/header.c:90:
+struct perf_trace_event_type
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#66: FILE: tools/perf/util/header.c:100:
+	if (strlen(name) > 64) {
+		printf("Event %s will be truncated\n", name);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#84: FILE: tools/perf/util/header.c:118:
+char * perf_header__find_event(u64 id)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
