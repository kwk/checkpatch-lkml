WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#100: FILE: net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1858:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(netlink_lookup);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#143: FILE: include/linux/netlink.h:160:
+extern struct sock *netlink_lookup(int protocol, __u32 pid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#156: FILE: net/compat.c:172:
+		kcmsg_base = kcmsg = sock_kmalloc(sk, kcmlen, sk->sk_allocation);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
