CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dev->towrite"
#87: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:1751:
+			    if (dev->towrite != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#119: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:2341:
+							if (!bio_flagged(wbi,

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
