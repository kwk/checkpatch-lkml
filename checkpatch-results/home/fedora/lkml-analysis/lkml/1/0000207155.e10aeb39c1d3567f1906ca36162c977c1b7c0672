WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#90: FILE: include/asm-generic/trace-clock.h:1:
+#ifndef _ASM_GENERIC_TRACE_CLOCK_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#94: FILE: include/asm-generic/trace-clock.h:5:
+ * include/asm-generic/trace-clock.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#102: FILE: include/asm-generic/trace-clock.h:13:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#142: FILE: include/asm-generic/trace-clock.h:53:
+extern void get_synthetic_tsc(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
