#30: 
A simplified version of the semantic patch making this change is as follows:

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#55: 
#include <linux/jiffies.h>

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
