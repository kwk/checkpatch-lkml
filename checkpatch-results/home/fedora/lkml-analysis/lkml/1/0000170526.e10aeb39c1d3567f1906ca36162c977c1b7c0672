#30: 
When one cat on the trace file, the leaf functions are printed without brackets:

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#117: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_functions_graph.c:217:
+get_return_for_leaf(struct trace_iterator *iter,
 		struct ftrace_graph_ent_entry *curr)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#129: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_functions_graph.c:226:
+	if (ring_iter)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
