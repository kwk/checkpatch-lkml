Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment
#80: FILE: mm/memory.c:1489:
+	spinlock_t *ptl;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#84: FILE: mm/memory.c:1493:
+	BUG_ON(PageAnon(newpage));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
