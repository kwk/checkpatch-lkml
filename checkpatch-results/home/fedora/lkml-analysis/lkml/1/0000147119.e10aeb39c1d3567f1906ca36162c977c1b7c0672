  it actually matters. Some Intel people will probably know how to fix this.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devexit is unnecessary
#71: FILE: drivers/dma/ioat.c:72:

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#73: FILE: drivers/dma/ioat.c:74:
+void dca_force(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#79: FILE: drivers/dma/ioat.c:80:
+static int ioat_dca_force = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
