Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo*	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#213: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/isd200.c:297:
+	u8*	sense_buffer;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
