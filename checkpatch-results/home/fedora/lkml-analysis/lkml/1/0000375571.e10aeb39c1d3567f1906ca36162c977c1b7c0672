#25: 
rework the now complete page lock API to provide acquisition and release hooks.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#44: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:156:
+extern void FASTCALL(__lock_page(struct page *page, unsigned long ip));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+extern void FASTCALL(__lock_page_nosync(struct page *page, unsigned long ip));

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#62: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:174:
+	int ret = !TestSetPageLocked(page);
+	if (ret)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
