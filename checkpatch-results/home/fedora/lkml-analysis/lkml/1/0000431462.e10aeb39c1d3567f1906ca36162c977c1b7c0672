Fix an Oops in the cciss driver caused by system shutdown while a filesystem

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tmp_ptr"
#59: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:3480:
+	if (tmp_ptr == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hba[i]"

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#67: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:3488:
+	 * To write all data in the battery backed cache to disks */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#71: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:3492:
+	if (return_code == IO_OK) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
