WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <port_Board>
#48: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:799:
+	struct riscom_board *bp = port_Board(rp);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#68: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:809:
+	rp->xmit_cnt = rp->xmit_head = rp->xmit_tail = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <port_No>
#114: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:885:
+	bp->DTR &= ~(1u << port_No(p));

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#115: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:886:
+^Iif (onoff == 0)^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#136: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:912:
+	return tty_port_open(&port->port, tty, filp);
 	                                       ^^^^
