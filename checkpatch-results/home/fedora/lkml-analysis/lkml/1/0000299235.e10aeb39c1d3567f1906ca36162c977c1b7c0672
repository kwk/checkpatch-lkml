WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#85: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:360:
+		/* fall thru */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#120: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_ali.c:39:
+int ali_atapi_dma = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'reliablity' may be misspelled - perhaps 'reliability'?
#145: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_ali.c:291:
+			       "WARNING: ATAPI DMA disabled for reliablity issues.  It can be enabled\n");
 			                                        ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'pass-thru' may be misspelled - perhaps 'pass-through'?
#207: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:353:
+	ATAPI_PASS_THRU		= 3,		/* SAT pass-thru */
 	               		    		       ^^^^^^^^^

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#216: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:853:
+extern int atapi_cmd_type(u8 opcode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
