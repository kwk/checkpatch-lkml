 - creat() and mmap() a file on hugetlbfs (file size is 200MB == 100 hugepages,)
   ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#131: FILE: mm/pagewalk.c:124:
+		 * in pmd_none_or_clear_bad(). */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
