Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#99: FILE: arch/alpha/lib/fls.c:1:
+/* 

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#100: FILE: arch/alpha/lib/fls.c:2:
+ * arch/alpha/lib/fls.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/bitops.h> instead of <asm/bitops.h>
#104: FILE: arch/alpha/lib/fls.c:6:
+#include <asm/bitops.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'efficent' may be misspelled - perhaps 'efficient'?

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

+/* This is fls(x)-1, except zero is held to zero.  This allows most
+   efficent input into extbl, plus it allows easy handling of fls(0)=0.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting
