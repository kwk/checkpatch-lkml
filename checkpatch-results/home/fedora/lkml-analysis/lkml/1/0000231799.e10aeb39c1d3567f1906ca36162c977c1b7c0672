WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#123: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#128: FILE: checkpoint/objhash.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#157: FILE: checkpoint/objhash.c:30:
+#define CR_OBJHASH_TOTAL  (1UL << CR_OBJHASH_NBITS - 1)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#163: FILE: checkpoint/objhash.c:36:
+		fput((struct file *) obj->ptr);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#166: FILE: checkpoint/objhash.c:39:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#216: FILE: checkpoint/objhash.c:89:

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
