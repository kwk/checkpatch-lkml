WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct platform_device *' should also have an identifier name
#52: FILE: include/linux/platform_device.h:53:
+	void (*remove_new)(struct platform_device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
