#17: 
Subject: [PATCH 09/09] Checkpatch.pl: Fixup xmit.c

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#87: FILE: drivers/staging/agnx/xmit.c:273:
+/*	stat->antenna = 3;
+	stat->mactime = be32_to_cpu(hdr->time_stamp);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (16, 32)
#120: FILE: drivers/staging/agnx/xmit.c:348:

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 126 exceeds 100 columns

+			if ((fctl & IEEE80211_FCTL_STYPE) != IEEE80211_STYPE_BEACON)/* && !(fctl & IEEE80211_STYPE_BEACON)) */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
