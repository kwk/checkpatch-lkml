This implements user_regset-style accessors for the powerpc general registers.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!target->thread.regs"
#54: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace.c:128:
+	if (target->thread.regs == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#64: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace.c:138:
+		unsigned long msr = get_user_msr(target);
+		ret = user_regset_copyout(&pos, &count, &kbuf, &ubuf, &msr,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
