WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#77: FILE: arch/m32r/boot/compressed/Makefile:2:
+# linux/arch/m32r/boot/compressed/Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
