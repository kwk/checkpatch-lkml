CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#83: FILE: include/linux/rcutree.h:79:
+extern void synchronize_rcu_expedited(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'compatability' may be misspelled - perhaps 'compatibility'?
#96: FILE: kernel/rcutree_plugin.h:397:
+ * grace period, but this is the crude slow compatability hack, so just
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'preemptable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'preemptible'?
#114: FILE: kernel/rcutree_plugin.h:580:
+ * But because preemptable RCU does not exist, map to rcu-sched.
                ^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched_expedited', prefer 'synchronize_rcu_expedited' instead
#118: FILE: kernel/rcutree_plugin.h:584:
+	synchronize_sched_expedited();

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.
