Subject: [PATCH] HPET: Workaround for a BIOS workaround on AMD SB700 platform

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#123: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/hpet.c:42:
+int sb700_hpet_workaround __initdata = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#135: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/hpet.c:393:

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.
