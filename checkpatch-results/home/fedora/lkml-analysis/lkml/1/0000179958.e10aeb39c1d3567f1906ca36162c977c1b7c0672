#136: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:714:
+ /**

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#188: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:38:
+extern void pci_allocate_cap_save_buffers(struct pci_dev *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
