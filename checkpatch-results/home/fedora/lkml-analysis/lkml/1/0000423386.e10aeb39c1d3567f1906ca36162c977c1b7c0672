Take two: I forgot to change the compat code.  This has now happened.  Only one

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/linux/file.h:76:
+extern int FASTCALL(get_unused_fd_flags(int flags));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#58: FILE: include/linux/socket.h:257:
+#define MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC 0x40000000	/* Set close_on_exit for file

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
