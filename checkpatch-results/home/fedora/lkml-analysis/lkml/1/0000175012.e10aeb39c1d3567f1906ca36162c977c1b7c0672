Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#246: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/include/mach/io.h:194:
+extern void omap2_init_common_hw(struct omap_sdrc_params *sp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
