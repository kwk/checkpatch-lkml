CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around grace->data[0]
#214: FILE: ipc/util.c:573:
+	sched = container_of(&(grace->data[0]), struct ipc_rcu_sched,

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#215: FILE: ipc/util.c:574:
+	sched = container_of(&(grace->data[0]), struct ipc_rcu_sched,
+				data[0]);
