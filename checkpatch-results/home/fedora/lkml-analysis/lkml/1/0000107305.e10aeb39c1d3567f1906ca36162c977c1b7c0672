WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#240: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:171:
+extern void preswap_shrink(unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#298: FILE: mm/preswap.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#299: FILE: mm/preswap.c:2:
+ * linux/mm/preswap.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#384: FILE: mm/preswap.c:87:
+ * was declined, and -ERRNO for a specific error */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tmem_ops"
#481: FILE: mm/preswap.c:184:
+	if (tmem_ops == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#518: FILE: mm/preswap.c:221:
+			if (total_pages_to_unuse < si->preswap_pages)
[...]
+			else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#519: FILE: mm/preswap.c:222:
+				pages = unuse_pages = total_pages_to_unuse;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#520: FILE: mm/preswap.c:223:
+			else {

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#539: FILE: mm/preswap.c:242:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
