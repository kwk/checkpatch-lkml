WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct cgroup_deferred_work *' should also have an identifier name
#57: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:442:
+	void (*func)(struct cgroup_deferred_work *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'name' - possible side-effects?
#60: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:445:
+#define CGROUP_DEFERRED_WORK(name, function)		\
+	struct cgroup_deferred_work name = {		\
+		.list = LIST_HEAD_INIT((name).list),	\
+		.func = (function),			\
+	};

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#60: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:445:
+#define CGROUP_DEFERRED_WORK(name, function)		\
+	struct cgroup_deferred_work name = {		\
+		.list = LIST_HEAD_INIT((name).list),	\
+		.func = (function),			\
+	};

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
