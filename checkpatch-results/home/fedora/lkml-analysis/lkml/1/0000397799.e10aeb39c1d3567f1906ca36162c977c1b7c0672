CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*st)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ct_expect_iter_state)...)
#46: FILE: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_expect.c:480:
+	st = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ct_expect_iter_state), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
