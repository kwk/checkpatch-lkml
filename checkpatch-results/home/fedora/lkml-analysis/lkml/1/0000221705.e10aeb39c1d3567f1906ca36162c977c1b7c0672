Provide a means for UV interrupt MMRs to be setup with the message to be sent

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#149: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic.c:3728:
+	BUG_ON(sizeof(struct uv_IO_APIC_route_entry) != sizeof(unsigned long));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#305: FILE: include/asm-x86/uv/uv_irq.h:30:
+extern int arch_enable_uv_irq(char *, unsigned int, int, int, unsigned long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char *' should also have an identifier name
#305: FILE: include/asm-x86/uv/uv_irq.h:30:
+extern int arch_enable_uv_irq(char *, unsigned int, int, int, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
