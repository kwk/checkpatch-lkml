The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#42: FILE: security/tomoyo/condition.c:2:
+ * security/tomoyo/condition.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#91: FILE: security/tomoyo/condition.c:51:

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
