Subject: [PATCH 1/2] nfsd: fix sparse warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#166: FILE: include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:60:
+extern struct seq_operations nfs_exports_op;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int *' should also have an identifier name
#176: FILE: include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:70:
+int		nfsd_get_nrthreads(int n, int *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

#177: FILE: include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:71:
+int		nfsd_set_nrthreads(int n, int *);
