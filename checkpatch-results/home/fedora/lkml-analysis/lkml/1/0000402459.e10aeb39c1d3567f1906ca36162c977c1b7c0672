                                                ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#74: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:171:
+extern int sysctl_dropbehind;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
