WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <spaceBitmapDesc>
#97: FILE: fs/udf/udf_sb.h:156:
+	int nr_groups = (map->s_partition_len + (sizeof(struct spaceBitmapDesc) << 3) +

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#106: FILE: fs/udf/udf_sb.h:165:
+	if (bitmap != NULL) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "bitmap"
#106: FILE: fs/udf/udf_sb.h:165:
+	if (bitmap != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#110: FILE: fs/udf/udf_sb.h:169:
+	} else

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 122 exceeds 100 columns
#111: FILE: fs/udf/udf_sb.h:170:
+		udf_error(sb, __FUNCTION__, "Unable to allocate space for bitmap and %d buffer_head pointers", nr_groups);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#111: FILE: fs/udf/udf_sb.h:170:
+		udf_error(sb, __FUNCTION__, "Unable to allocate space for bitmap and %d buffer_head pointers", nr_groups);
