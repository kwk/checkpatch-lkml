WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev_priv->mm.gtt_mapping"
#245: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_dma.c:1093:
+	if (dev_priv->mm.gtt_mapping == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#332: FILE: include/linux/io-mapping.h:79:
+	BUG_ON(offset >= mapping->size);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#334: FILE: include/linux/io-mapping.h:81:
+	pfn = (unsigned long) (phys_addr >> PAGE_SHIFT);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#347: FILE: include/linux/io-mapping.h:96:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
