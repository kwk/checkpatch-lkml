 	   ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#128: FILE: init/Kconfig:674:
+config RANDOMIZATION_NONE
+	bool "NONE"
+	help
+	   Turn the process address space randomization off by default.
+	   Equivalent to sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space = 0.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#176: FILE: mm/memory.c:91:
+int randomize_va_space __read_mostly = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
