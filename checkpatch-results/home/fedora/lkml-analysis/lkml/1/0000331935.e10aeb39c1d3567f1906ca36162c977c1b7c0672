ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

**mrq)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#298: FILE: drivers/memstick/core/mspro_block.c:233:
+	struct device_attribute *dev_attr
+		= container_of(attr, struct device_attribute, attr);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

+			"%d %04u-%02u-%02u %02u:%02u:%02u\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'succeded' may be misspelled - perhaps 'succeeded'?

                                                                    ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*s_attr)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct mspro_sys_attr)...)
#696: FILE: drivers/memstick/core/mspro_block.c:875:
+		s_attr = kzalloc(sizeof(struct mspro_sys_attr), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#736: FILE: drivers/memstick/core/mspro_block.c:895:
+		s_attr->dev_attr.attr.mode = S_IRUGO;

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
