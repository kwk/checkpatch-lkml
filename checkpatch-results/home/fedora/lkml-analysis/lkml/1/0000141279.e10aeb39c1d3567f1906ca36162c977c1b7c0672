WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#74: FILE: kernel/cr/cr-x86_32.c:33:
+		WARN(1, "xstate size mismatch %u:%u, tsk '%s'\n", len_xstate, xstate_size, i->cr_comm);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
