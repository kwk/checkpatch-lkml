WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#134: FILE: drivers/acpi/Kconfig:45:
+config ACPI_SLEEP
+	bool "ACPI hooks for system sleep and wakeup"
+	select HOTPLUG_CPU if X86 && SMP
+	select SUSPEND_SMP if X86 && SMP
+	default X86
+	---help---
+	  Say Y to include ACPI hooks for system sleep and wakeup.
+	  This options is needed for suspend to RAM on ACPI-enabled
+	  machines, for it includes the wakup vector support,
+	  as well as wakeup-device support.
+
+	  System Hibernate to disk can function without this option,
+	  but wakeup devices may work better with it.
+
+	  Disabling ACPI_SLEEP saves about 16 KB, and allows
+	  disabling HOTPLUG_CPU, which saves an additional 18 KB.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
