#36: 
take the lock for.  This simplifies the -EDEADLOCK test as if the lock is owned

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: kernel/futex.c:622:
+	ret = lock_taken = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
