safe on multiple CPUs.  See the _rcu_barrier() implementation which explains

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#69: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_device.c:379:
+	 *  rcu_barrier() take multiple CPUs into account */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
