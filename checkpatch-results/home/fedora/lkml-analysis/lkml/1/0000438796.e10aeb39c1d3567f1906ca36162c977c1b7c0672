CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#232: FILE: sound/pci/maestro3.c:2799:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

  /*

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
