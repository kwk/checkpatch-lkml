ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#68: FILE: fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_super.c:724:
+int
  xfs_blkdev_issue_flush(

  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#85: FILE: fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_super.h:92:
+extern int xfs_blkdev_issue_flush(struct xfs_buftarg *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct xfs_buftarg *' should also have an identifier name
#85: FILE: fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_super.h:92:
+extern int xfs_blkdev_issue_flush(struct xfs_buftarg *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
