ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#47: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/process.c	2007-03-23 23:02:16.000000000 -0400

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#88: FILE: include/linux/tick.h:105:
+extern ktime_t tick_nohz_get_sleep_length(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
