CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!wbc->bdi"
#104: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:1423:
+		if (wbc->bdi == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#148: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:527:
+		if (bdi_nr_writeback > bdi_nr_reclaimable / 2) {
[...]
+		} else if (bdi->dirty_exceeded != BDI_RECLAIMABLE_EXCEEDED)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
