The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#376: FILE: drivers/video/msm/msm_fb.c:1:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
