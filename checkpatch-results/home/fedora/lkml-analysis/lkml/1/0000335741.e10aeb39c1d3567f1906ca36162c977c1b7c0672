CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#77: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_ud.c:465:
+		if (header_in_data) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#78: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_ud.c:466:
+			wc.imm_data = *(__be32 *) data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
