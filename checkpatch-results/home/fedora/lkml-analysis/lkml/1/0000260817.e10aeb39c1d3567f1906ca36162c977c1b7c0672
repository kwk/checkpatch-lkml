Subject: [PATCH] x86: remove arbitrary ELF section limit in 32-bit relocatable kernel

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'auxilliary' may be misspelled - perhaps 'auxiliary'?
#63: 
The 32-bit x86 relocatable kernel requires an auxilliary host program

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
