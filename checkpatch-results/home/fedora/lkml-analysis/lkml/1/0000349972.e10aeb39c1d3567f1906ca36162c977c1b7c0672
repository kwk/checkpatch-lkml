WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#46: FILE: drivers/md/mktables.c:1:
+/* -*- linux-c -*- ------------------------------------------------------- *

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:STRING_FRAGMENTS: Consecutive strings are generally better as a single string
#79: FILE: drivers/md/mktables.c:83:

WARNING:STRING_FRAGMENTS: Consecutive strings are generally better as a single string
#99: FILE: drivers/md/mktables.c:98:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#106: FILE: drivers/md/mktables.c:102:
+			invtbl[i + j] = v = gfpow(i + j, 254);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
