#26: 
Andrew Morton pointed out similar string hacking and obfuscated check for zero-length input

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'behavious' may be misspelled - perhaps 'behaviour'?
#29: 
whitespace from user input. It does not change function behavious.
                                                        ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#59: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:504:
+	if (strict_strtol(strstrip(buffer), 10, &type))

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
