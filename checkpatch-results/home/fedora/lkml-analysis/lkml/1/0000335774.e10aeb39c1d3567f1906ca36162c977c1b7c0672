WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#57: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr_32.c:191:
+	unsigned long end = ((unsigned long)&__init_end) & LARGE_PAGE_MASK;
+	return addr >= start && addr < end + LARGE_PAGE_SIZE;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#124: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgtable_32.h:37:
+int text_address(unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
