ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#112: FILE: arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c:59:
+		if (system_state == SYSTEM_BOOTING
+			? x > MAXMEM : !phys_addr_valid(x))
+		{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#176: FILE: include/asm-x86/page.h:198:
+extern bool __virt_addr_valid(unsigned long kaddr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
