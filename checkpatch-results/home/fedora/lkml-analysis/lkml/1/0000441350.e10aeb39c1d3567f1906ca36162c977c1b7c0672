Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#388: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:207:

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#417: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:398:
+						if (print_task_stats)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#418: FILE: Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c:399:
+							print_taskstats((struct taskstats *) NLA_DATA(na));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
