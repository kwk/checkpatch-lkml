WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#67: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h:545:
+#define put_user_try		do {		\
+	int __uaccess_err = 0;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while loop
#70: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h:548:
+#define put_user_catch(err)			\
+	(err) |= __uaccess_err;			\
+} while (0)

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#74: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h:552:
+#define put_user_ex(x, ptr)	do {		\
+	__uaccess_err |= __put_user(x, ptr);	\
+} while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
