Subject: [PATCH] ide: use standard timing for XFER_PIO_SLOW mode in ide_timing_compute()

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#54: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-timings.c:169:
+		if (speed >= XFER_PIO_0 && speed <= XFER_SW_DMA_0) {
[...]
+		} else if (speed >= XFER_MW_DMA_0 && speed <= XFER_MW_DMA_2)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#56: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-timings.c:171:
+				p.cycle = p.cyc8b = id[ATA_ID_EIDE_PIO];

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
