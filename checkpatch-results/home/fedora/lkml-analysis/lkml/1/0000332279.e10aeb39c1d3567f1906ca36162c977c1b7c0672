WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#35: 
Add text_poke_early, for alternatives and paravirt boot-time and module load

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'and'
#44: 
- Fix text_set and text_poke alignment check (mixed up bitwise and and or)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#164: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:499:
+	BUG_ON(len > sizeof(long));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#172: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:507:
+	/* Could also do a CLFLUSH here to speed up CPU recovery; but

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#194: FILE: include/asm-x86/alternative.h:160:
+extern void add_nops(void *insns, unsigned int len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
