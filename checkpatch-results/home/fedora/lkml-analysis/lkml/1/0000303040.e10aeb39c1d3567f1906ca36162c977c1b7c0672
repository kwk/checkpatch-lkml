CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dev->res)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pnp_resource_table)...)
#198: FILE: drivers/pnp/core.c:122:
+	dev->res = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pnp_resource_table), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
