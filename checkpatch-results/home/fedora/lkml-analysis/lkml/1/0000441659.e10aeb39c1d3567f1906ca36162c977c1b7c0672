CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: include/linux/migrate.h:17:
+extern gfp_t page_gfp_mask(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#110: FILE: mm/migrate.c:741:
+	struct address_space *mapping = page_mapping(page);
+	return mapping? mapping_gfp_mask(mapping): GFP_HIGHUSER;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
