Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

+extern int timer_fixup_object(struct debug_obj *obj, enum debug_obj_op mode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*timer)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct timer_list)...)
#149: FILE: kernel/timer.c:365:
+	timer = kmalloc(sizeof(struct timer_list), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
