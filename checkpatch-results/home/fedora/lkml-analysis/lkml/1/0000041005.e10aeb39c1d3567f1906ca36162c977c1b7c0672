WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Duplicate signature
#78: 
Cc: Frederic Weisbecker <fweisbec@gmail.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#160: FILE: tools/perf/util/probe-event.c:54:
+	va_list ap;
+	va_start(ap, format);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#233: FILE: tools/perf/util/probe-event.c:243:
+	pp->probes[0] = buf = zalloc(MAX_CMDLEN);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#319: FILE: tools/perf/util/probe-event.c:324:
+			die("kprobe_events file does not exist -"
+			    " please rebuild with CONFIG_KPROBE_TRACER.");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#433: FILE: tools/perf/util/probe-event.h:8:
+extern int synthesize_perf_probe_event(struct probe_point *pp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
