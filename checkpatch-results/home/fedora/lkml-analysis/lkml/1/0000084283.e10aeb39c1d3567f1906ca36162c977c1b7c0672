WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#69: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/Kconfig:429:
+config SAMSUNG_BACKLIGHT
+	tristate "Samsung Backlight driver"
+	depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
+	depends on DMI
+	---help---
+	  This driver adds support to control the backlight on a number of
+	  Samsung laptops, like the N130.
+
+	  It will only be loaded on laptops that properly need it, so it is
+	  safe to say Y here.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#91: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/samsung-backlight.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct backlight_ops should normally be const
#148: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/samsung-backlight.c:58:
+static struct backlight_ops backlight_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#199: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/samsung-backlight.c:109:
+	printk(KERN_INFO KBUILD_MODNAME ": found laptop model '%s'\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#200: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/samsung-backlight.c:110:

+		id->ident);

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after samsung_dmi_table[]
#204: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/samsung-backlight.c:114:
+static struct dmi_system_id __initdata samsung_dmi_table[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#254: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/samsung-backlight.c:164:
+module_param(offset, int, S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
