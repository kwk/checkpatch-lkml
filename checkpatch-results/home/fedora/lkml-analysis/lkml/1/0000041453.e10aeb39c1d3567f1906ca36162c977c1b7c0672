WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#94: FILE: mm/mmap.c:905:
+ * The caller must hold down_write(&current->mm->mmap_sem). */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
