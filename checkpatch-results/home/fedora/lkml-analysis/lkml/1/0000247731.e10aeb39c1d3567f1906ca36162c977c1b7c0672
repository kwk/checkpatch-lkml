WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#50: FILE: fs/unionfs/dentry.c:26:
+	BUG_ON(!dentry || dbstart(dentry) < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#134: FILE: fs/unionfs/main.c:92:
+	BUG_ON(is_negative_lower(dentry));

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#154: FILE: fs/unionfs/union.h:379:
+extern bool is_negative_lower(const struct dentry *dentry);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
