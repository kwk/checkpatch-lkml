Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#94: FILE: arch/um/sys-i386/elfcore.c:90:
+			if (phdrp[i].p_type == PT_LOAD) {
+				return (size_t) phdrp[i].p_filesz;
+			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "vma"
#135: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1924:
+	for (vma = first_vma(current, gate_vma); vma != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Elf_Half>
#161: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1977:
+	Elf_Half e_phnum = 0;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#175: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:2012:
+	 * include/linux/elf.h for further information. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
