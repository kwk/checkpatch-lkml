CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#168: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/time.c:52:
+	return ((unsigned long long) tv->tv_sec) * BILLION +

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#192: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:257:
+extern int timer_one_shot(int ticks);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#258: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/skas/process.c:297:
+		printk("Failed to get itimer, errno = %d\n", errno);

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#273: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/skas/process.c:346:
+				if(now < nsecs)

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#301: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/skas/process.c:414:
+^I^I^I^I^I           { .it_value = tv,$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
