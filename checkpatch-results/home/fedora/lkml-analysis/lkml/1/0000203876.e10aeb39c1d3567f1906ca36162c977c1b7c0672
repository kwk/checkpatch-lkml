CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#98: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1488:
+	tailp = upp = &i->head;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!end"
#141: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1524:
+			if (end == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
