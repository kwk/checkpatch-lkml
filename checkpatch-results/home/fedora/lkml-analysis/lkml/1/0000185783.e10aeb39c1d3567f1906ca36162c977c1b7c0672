WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#44: 
is partly missing.  So I took that bit from the earlier version of the patch.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#50: 
--- a/fs/exec.c~getrusage-fill-ru_maxrss-value

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#118: FILE: kernel/fork.c:854:
+	sig->maxrss = sig->cmaxrss = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#132: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1682:
+		struct mm_struct *mm = get_task_mm(p);
+		if (mm) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
