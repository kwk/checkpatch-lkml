WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#177: FILE: mm/migrate.c:632:
+	BUG_ON(charge);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#226: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:62:
+extern void mem_cgroup_end_migration(struct mem_cgroup *mem,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#355: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:847:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#364: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:856:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
