The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

+DEF_NATIVE(pv_cpu_ops, irq_enable_syscall_ret, "movq %gs:" __stringify(pda_oldrsp) ", %rsp; swapgs; sysretq;");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
