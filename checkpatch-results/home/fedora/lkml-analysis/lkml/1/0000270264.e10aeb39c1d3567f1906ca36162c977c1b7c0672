WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#70: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#75: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/mbp_nvidia_bl.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after mbp_device_table[]
#104: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/mbp_nvidia_bl.c:30:
+static struct dmi_system_id __initdata mbp_device_table[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1377655732.3619.19.camel@joe-AO722/

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct backlight_ops should normally be const
#146: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/mbp_nvidia_bl.c:72:
+static struct backlight_ops mbp_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
