ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#40: FILE: drivers/media/video/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-ctrl.c:413:
+		if (!(msk & valid_bits)) continue;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <STp>
#83: FILE: drivers/scsi/st.c:2885:
+				STp->use_pf = !(STp->use_pf | PF_TESTED);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#135: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlmglue.c:673:
+	BUG_ON((!(lockres->l_flags & OCFS2_LOCK_BUSY)));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
