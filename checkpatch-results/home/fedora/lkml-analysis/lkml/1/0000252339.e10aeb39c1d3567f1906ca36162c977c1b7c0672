Do not return value from do_send_fragment and do_send_packet, it's not used.

#52: FILE: drivers/char/pcmcia/ipwireless/hardware.c:404:
+static void do_send_fragment(struct ipw_hardware *hw, unsigned char *data,
 			    unsigned length)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#64: FILE: drivers/char/pcmcia/ipwireless/hardware.c:410:
+	BUG_ON(length > hw->ll_mtu);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
