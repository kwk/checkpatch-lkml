WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'beeing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'being'?
#27: 
which did not work as expected because the timer was not beeing
                                                         ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#56: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-sa1100.c:163:
+		return -EINVAL;

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#207: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-sa1100.c:440:
+	 * it here.*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
