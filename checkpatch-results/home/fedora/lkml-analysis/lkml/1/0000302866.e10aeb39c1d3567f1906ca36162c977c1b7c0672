CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#47: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:165:
+	tsec->osid = tsec->sid = SECINITSID_UNLABELED;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'noone' may be misspelled - perhaps 'no one'?
#80: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1873:
+ * Returns NULL if noone is tracing @task, or the &struct task_struct
                    ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "tracer"
#111: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:2138:
+			if (likely(tracer != NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "tracer"
#155: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:5162:
+		if (tracer != NULL) {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#158: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:5165:
+			u32 ptsid = ptsec->sid;
+			rcu_read_unlock();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
