WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#16: 
Subject: [PATCH 119/148] include/asm-x86/string_64.h: checkpatch cleanups - formatting only

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#64: FILE: include/asm-x86/string_64.h:12:
+	unsigned long d0, d1, d2;
+	asm volatile("rep ; movsl\n\t"

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#92: FILE: include/asm-x86/string_64.h:33:
+extern void *__memcpy(void *to, const void *from, size_t len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'src' - possible side-effects?
#93: FILE: include/asm-x86/string_64.h:34:
+#define memcpy(dst, src, len)					\
+({								\
+	size_t __len = (len);					\
+	void *__ret;						\
+	if (__builtin_constant_p(len) && __len >= 64)		\
+		__ret = __memcpy((dst), (src), __len);		\
+	else							\
+		__ret = __builtin_memcpy((dst), (src), __len);	\
+	__ret;							\
+})
