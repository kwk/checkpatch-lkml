WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#83: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#88: FILE: drivers/serial/msm_serial.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#89: FILE: drivers/serial/msm_serial.c:2:
+ * drivers/serial/msm_serial.c - driver for msm7k serial device and console

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#129: FILE: drivers/serial/msm_serial.c:42:
+#define to_msm_uart(uart_port) ((struct msm_port *) uart_port)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ignorning' may be misspelled - perhaps 'ignoring'?
#206: FILE: drivers/serial/msm_serial.c:119:
+		/* Mask conditions we're ignorning. */
 		                         ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#209: FILE: drivers/serial/msm_serial.c:122:
+		if (sr & UART_SR_RX_BREAK) {
[...]
+		} else if (sr & UART_SR_PAR_FRAME_ERR) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ser' may be misspelled - perhaps 'set'?
#601: FILE: drivers/serial/msm_serial.c:514:
+static int msm_verify_port(struct uart_port *port, struct serial_struct *ser)
                                                                          ^^^

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct uart_ops should normally be const
#627: FILE: drivers/serial/msm_serial.c:540:
+static struct uart_ops msm_uart_pops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#699: FILE: drivers/serial/msm_serial.c:612:
+	BUG_ON(co->index < 0 || co->index >= UART_NR);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
