CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/alternative.h:180:
+extern void text_poke_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#118: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:496:
+	BUG_ON(!text_poke_area[0] || !text_poke_area[1]);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#144: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:531:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#196: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:74:
+void vunmap_page_range(unsigned long addr, unsigned long end)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
