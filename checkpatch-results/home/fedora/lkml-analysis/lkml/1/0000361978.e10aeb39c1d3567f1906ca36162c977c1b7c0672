tracking of the number of writers to a mount.  However, it causes scalability

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ouside' may be misspelled - perhaps 'outside'?
#106: FILE: fs/namespace.c:96:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#133: FILE: fs/namespace.c:123:
+	int cpu;
+	for_each_possible_cpu(cpu) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#161: FILE: fs/namespace.c:151:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
