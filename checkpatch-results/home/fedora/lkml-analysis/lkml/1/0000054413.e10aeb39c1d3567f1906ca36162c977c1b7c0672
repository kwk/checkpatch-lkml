Subject: [PATCH] added one new netlink message ISCSI_UEVENT_REQ_IPCONF in libiscsi to support dhcp functionality in cxgb3i

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#80: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c:1513:
+	struct Scsi_Host *shost;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#84: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c:1517:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
