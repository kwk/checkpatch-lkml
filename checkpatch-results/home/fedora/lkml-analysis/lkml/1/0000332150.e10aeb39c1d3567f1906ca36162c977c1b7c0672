CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#56: FILE: include/linux/miscdevice.h:46:
+extern int __misc_deregister(struct miscdevice *misc, bool suspended);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#61: FILE: include/linux/miscdevice.h:51:
+}
+static inline int misc_deregister_suspended(struct miscdevice *misc)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
