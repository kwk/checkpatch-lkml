ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#78: 
--- a/kernel/fork.c~fork_init-fix-division-by-zero

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#101: FILE: kernel/fork.c:195:
+		u64 m = mempages * PAGE_SIZE;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
