WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mask_str"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
