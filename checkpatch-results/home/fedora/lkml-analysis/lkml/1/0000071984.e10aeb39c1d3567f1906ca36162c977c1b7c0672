WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#133: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:1561:
+++ b/drivers/pci/pci.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+extern void pci_acs_init(struct pci_dev *dev);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#138: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:205:
+extern void pci_acs_init(struct pci_dev *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
