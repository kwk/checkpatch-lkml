CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/linux/security.h:58:
+extern int cap_inode_removexattr(struct path *path, const char *name);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#86: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1380:
+	int (*inode_removexattr) (struct path *path, const char *name);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
