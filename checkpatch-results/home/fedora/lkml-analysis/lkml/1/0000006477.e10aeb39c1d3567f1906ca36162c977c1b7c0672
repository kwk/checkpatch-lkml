Subject: [PATCH 44/66] arch/powerpc/sysdev/cpm2_pic.h: Checkpatch cleanup

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: arch/powerpc/sysdev/cpm2_pic.h:6:
+extern void cpm2_pic_init(struct device_node *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct device_node *' should also have an identifier name
#48: FILE: arch/powerpc/sysdev/cpm2_pic.h:6:
+extern void cpm2_pic_init(struct device_node *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
