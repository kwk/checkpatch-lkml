Subject: [PATCH v2] pm: Move nvs routines into a seperate file.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#58: FILE: kernel/power/hibernation_nvs.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#59: FILE: kernel/power/hibernation_nvs.c:2:
+ * linux/kernel/power/hibernation_nvs.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*entry)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct nvs_page)...)
#104: FILE: kernel/power/hibernation_nvs.c:47:
+		entry = kzalloc(sizeof(struct nvs_page), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Error>
#106: FILE: kernel/power/hibernation_nvs.c:49:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#368: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:260:
+extern int hibernate_nvs_register(unsigned long start, unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
