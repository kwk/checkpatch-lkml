Signed-Off-By:  Ben Greear <greearb@candelatech.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#96: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:1396:
+			else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
