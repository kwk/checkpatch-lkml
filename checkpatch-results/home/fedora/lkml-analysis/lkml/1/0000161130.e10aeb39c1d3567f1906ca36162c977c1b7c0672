WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct spi_device *' should also have an identifier name
#90: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_bitbang.c:278:
+	int (*setup_transfer)(struct spi_device *, struct spi_transfer *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#204: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_bitbang.c:332:
+				t->rx_dma = t->tx_dma = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#293: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_bitbang.c:396:
+		m = container_of(bitbang->queue.next, struct spi_message,
+				queue);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#329: FILE: include/linux/spi/spi_bitbang.h:66:
+extern int spi_bitbang_transfer_sync(struct spi_device *spi,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
