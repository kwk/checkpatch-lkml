ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#53: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:1221:
+struct root_device
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*root)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct root_device)...)
#90: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:1258:
+	root = kzalloc(sizeof(struct root_device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#156: FILE: include/linux/device.h:488:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
