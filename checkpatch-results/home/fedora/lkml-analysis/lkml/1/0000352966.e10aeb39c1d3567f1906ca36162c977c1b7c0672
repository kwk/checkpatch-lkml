Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#57: 
--- a/drivers/scsi/scsi.c~revert-6f5391c283d7fdcf24bf40786ea79061919d1e1d

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#143: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1244:
+	BUG_ON(!blk_pc_request(cmd->request));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SCpnt>
#213: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:512:
+	SCpnt->done = sd_rw_intr;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#231: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:899:
+static void sd_rw_intr(struct scsi_cmnd * SCpnt)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#322: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_cmnd.h:44:
+	void (*done) (struct scsi_cmnd *);	/* Mid-level done function */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct scsi_cmnd *' should also have an identifier name
#322: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_cmnd.h:44:
+	void (*done) (struct scsi_cmnd *);	/* Mid-level done function */

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#330: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_cmnd.h:125:
+extern void scsi_io_completion(struct scsi_cmnd *, unsigned int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
