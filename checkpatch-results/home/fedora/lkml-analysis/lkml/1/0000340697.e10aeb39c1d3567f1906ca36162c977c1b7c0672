CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#58: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1001:
+		hwgroup = kmalloc_node(sizeof(*hwgroup), GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_ZERO,
 		                                                   ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hwgroup"
#60: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1003:
+		if (hwgroup == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#64: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1007:
+		hwgroup->hwif = hwif->next = hwif;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
