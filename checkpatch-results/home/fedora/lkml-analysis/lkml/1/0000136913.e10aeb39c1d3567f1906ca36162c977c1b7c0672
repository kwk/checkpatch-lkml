CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*audio)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_client)...)
#351: FILE: drivers/staging/go7007/s2250-board.c:490:
+	audio = kmalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_client), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!audio"
#352: FILE: drivers/staging/go7007/s2250-board.c:491:
+	if (audio == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
