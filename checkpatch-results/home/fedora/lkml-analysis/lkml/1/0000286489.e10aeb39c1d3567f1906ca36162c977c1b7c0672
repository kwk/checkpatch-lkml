comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct zap_details *' should also have an identifier name
#61: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:747:
+unsigned long unmap_vmas(struct vm_area_struct *start_vma, unsigned long start_addr,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
