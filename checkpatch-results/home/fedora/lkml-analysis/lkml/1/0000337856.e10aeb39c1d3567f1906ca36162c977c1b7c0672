CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dslot)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dummy_slot)...)
#89: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/fakephp.c:116:
+	dslot = kzalloc(sizeof(struct dummy_slot), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#115: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/fakephp.c:289:
+		 * otherwise flush_workqueue() could deadlock */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
