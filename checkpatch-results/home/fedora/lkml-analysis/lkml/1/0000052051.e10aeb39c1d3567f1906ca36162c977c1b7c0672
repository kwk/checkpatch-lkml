#32: 
Changing the mm counters to per cpu counters is possible after the introduction

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#153: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:405:
+	unsigned long _rss = get_mm_rss(mm);
+	if (mm->hiwater_rss < _rss)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:MEMSET: memset to 0's uses 0 as the 2nd argument, not the 3rd
#187: FILE: kernel/fork.c:460:
+		memset(m, sizeof(struct mm_counter), 0);

The memset use appears to be incorrect.  This may be caused due to
badly ordered parameters.  Please recheck the usage.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#198: FILE: kernel/fork.c:489:
+		if (mm->rss)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
