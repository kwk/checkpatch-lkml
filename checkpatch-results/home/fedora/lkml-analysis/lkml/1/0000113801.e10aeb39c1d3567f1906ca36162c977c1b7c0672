CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#109: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1906:

 				} else if (buffer_mapped(bh))
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#112: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1909:
+					BUG_ON(bh->b_bdev != inode->i_sb->s_bdev);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
