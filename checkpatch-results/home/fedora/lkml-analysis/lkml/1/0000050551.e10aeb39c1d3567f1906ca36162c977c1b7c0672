CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#79: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:1339:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
