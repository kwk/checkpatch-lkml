Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#189: FILE: fs/ext4/extents.c:501:
+	i = depth = ext_depth(inode);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#284: FILE: fs/ext4/extents.c:1904:
+			BUG_ON(i + 1 > depth);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
