Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "nd"
#267: FILE: tools/perf/util/map.c:86:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!kernel_map"

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#580: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1433:
+	kernel_map->map_ip = kernel_map->unmap_ip = identity__map_ip;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vdso"
#587: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1438:

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
