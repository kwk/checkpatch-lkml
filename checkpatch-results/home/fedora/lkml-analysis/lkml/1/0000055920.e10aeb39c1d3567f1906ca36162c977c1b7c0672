CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: include/linux/rcutiny.h:72:
+extern int rcu_cpu_notify(struct notifier_block *self, unsigned long action, void *hcpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'call_rcu_bh', prefer 'call_rcu' instead
#211: FILE: kernel/rcutiny.c:246:
+void call_rcu_bh(struct rcu_head *head, void (*func)(struct rcu_head *rcu))

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis
