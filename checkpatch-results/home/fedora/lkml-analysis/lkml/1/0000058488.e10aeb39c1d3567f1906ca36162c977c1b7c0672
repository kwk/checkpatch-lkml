WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#173: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_via.c:114:
+	{ "vt6415",	PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_6415,     0x00, 0xff, VIA_UDMA_133 | VIA_BAD_AST | VIA_NO_ENABLES },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#195: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_mv.c:1395:
+		if (link == ap->excl_link) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
