WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#52: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#57: FILE: fs/ceph/export.c:1:
+#include <linux/exportfs.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'dout' may be misspelled - perhaps 'doubt'?

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '__fh_to_dentry', this function's name, in a string
#142: FILE: fs/ceph/export.c:86:
+	dout("__fh_to_dentry %llx\n", fh->ino);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
