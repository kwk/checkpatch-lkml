CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#95: FILE: fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_aops.c:942:
+#define len (1 << inode->i_blkbits)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#113: FILE: fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_aops.c:1028:
+				if (startio && wbc->sync_mode == WB_SYNC_NONE && wbc->nonblocking) {
+					flags = BMAPI_ALLOCATE | BMAPI_TRYLOCK;
+				}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
