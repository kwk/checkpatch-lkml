CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "req->ki_filp"
#76: FILE: fs/aio.c:510:
+		if (req->ki_filp != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LIKELY_MISUSE: nested (un)?likely() calls, IS_ERR already uses unlikely() internally
#116: FILE: fs/aio.c:556:
