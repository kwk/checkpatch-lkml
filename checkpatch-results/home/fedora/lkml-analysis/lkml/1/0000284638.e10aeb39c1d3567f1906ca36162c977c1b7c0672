CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p->first_page != page'
#41: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:306:
+		if (unlikely(!PageTail(p) ||
 				(p->first_page != page)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#42: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:307:
+		if (unlikely(!PageTail(p) ||
 				(p->first_page != page)))
