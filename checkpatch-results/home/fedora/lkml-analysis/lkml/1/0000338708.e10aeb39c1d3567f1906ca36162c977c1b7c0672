WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#50: 
#include <linux/module.h>

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#122: FILE: noinline2.c:25:
+noinline static void probeme(int nargs, ...)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#125: FILE: noinline2.c:28:
+	va_list args;
+	va_start(args, nargs);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
