CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#111: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1657:
+extern int task_user_equiv(struct task_struct *tsk, struct user_struct *u);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#185: FILE: kernel/user.c:99:
+static struct user_struct *uid_hash_find(uid_t uid,
+				struct hlist_head *hashent)

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#211: FILE: kernel/user.c:263:
+void unregister_user_ns_kobj(struct user_namespace *ns);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#257: FILE: kernel/user.c:359:
+	struct kobject *obj = &ns->kobject;
+	kobject_uevent(obj, KOBJ_REMOVE);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
