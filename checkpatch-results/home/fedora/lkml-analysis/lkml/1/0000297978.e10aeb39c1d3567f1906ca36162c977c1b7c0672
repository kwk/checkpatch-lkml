Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#128: FILE: fs/devpts/inode.c:150:
+	inode->i_uid = inode->i_gid = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
