#58: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1295:
+static int do_send_sigqueue(int sig, struct sigqueue *q, struct task_struct *t,
+		struct sigpending *pending)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#66: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1303:
+		BUG_ON(q->info.si_code != SI_TIMER);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
