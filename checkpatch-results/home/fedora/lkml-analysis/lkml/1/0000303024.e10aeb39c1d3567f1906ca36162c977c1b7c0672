WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#71: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/8xx/Kconfig:112:
+config 8xx_GPIO
+	bool "GPIO API Support"
+	select GENERIC_GPIO
+	select HAVE_GPIO_LIB
+	help
+	  Saying Y here will cause the ports on an MPC8xx processor to be used
+	  with the GPIO API.  If you say N here, the kernel needs less memory.
+
+	  If in doubt, say Y here.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/gpio.h> instead of <asm/gpio.h>
#102: FILE: arch/powerpc/sysdev/cpm1.c:48:
+#include <asm/gpio.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
