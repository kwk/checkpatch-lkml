ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#333: FILE: include/linux/ncp_fs.h:90:
+	void __user *	object_name;	/* a userspace data, in most cases user name */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
