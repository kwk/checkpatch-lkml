CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#83: FILE: include/linux/trace_clock.h:18:
+extern u64 notrace trace_clock_walltime(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
