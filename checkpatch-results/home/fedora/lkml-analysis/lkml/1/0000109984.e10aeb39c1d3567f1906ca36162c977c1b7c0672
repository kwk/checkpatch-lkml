The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

#49: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c:244:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#49: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c:244:
+       {       /* Handle problems with rebooting on CompuLab SBC-FITPC2
+               .callback = set_bios_reboot,

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
