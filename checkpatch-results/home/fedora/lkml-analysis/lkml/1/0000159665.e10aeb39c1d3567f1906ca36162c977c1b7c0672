WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#53: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#101: FILE: net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:75:
+static int disable_ipv6 = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#118: FILE: net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:1013:
+	for(r = &inetsw6[0]; r < &inetsw6[SOCK_MAX]; ++r)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#122: FILE: net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:1017:
+		printk(KERN_INFO

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#124: FILE: net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:1019:
+		       "IPv6: Loaded, but administratively disabled, "
+		       "reboot required to enable\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
