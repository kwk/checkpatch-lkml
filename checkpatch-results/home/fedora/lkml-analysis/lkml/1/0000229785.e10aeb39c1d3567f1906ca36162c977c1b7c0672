WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/topology.h> instead of <asm/topology.h>
#46: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel.c:19:
+#include <asm/topology.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#81: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel.c:87:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#100: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel.c:106:
+	unsigned node;

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#105: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel.c:111:
+	/* Don't do the funky fallback heuristics the AMD version employs
+	   for now. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#105: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel.c:111:
+	   for now. */

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#111: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel.c:117:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "CPU %d/%x -> Node %d\n", cpu, apicid, node);

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
