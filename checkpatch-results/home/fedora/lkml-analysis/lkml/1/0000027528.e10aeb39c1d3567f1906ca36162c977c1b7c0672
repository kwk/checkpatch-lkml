CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#395: FILE: lib/sort.c:154:
+		p = oldhead = list;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#462: FILE: lib/sort.c:221:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(list_sort);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
