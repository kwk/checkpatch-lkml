WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#254: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-4965.c:1964:
+	int uninitialized_var(tid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'tid' should also have an identifier name
#254: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-4965.c:1964:
+	int uninitialized_var(tid);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
