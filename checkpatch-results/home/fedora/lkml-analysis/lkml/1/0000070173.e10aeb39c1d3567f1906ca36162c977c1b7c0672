But these operations are mostly generic accross archs. Especially now

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#245: FILE: include/trace/syscall.h:36:
+extern unsigned long arch_syscall_addr(int nr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#257: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_syscalls.c:17:
+extern unsigned long __start_syscalls_metadata[];

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#258: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_syscalls.c:18:
+extern unsigned long __stop_syscalls_metadata[];

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#333: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_syscalls.c:447:
+	syscalls_metadata = kzalloc(sizeof(*syscalls_metadata) *
+					NR_syscalls, GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.
