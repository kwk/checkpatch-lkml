Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#242: FILE: drivers/video/stifb.c:1104:
+		/* Visualize cards can run either in "double buffer" or

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
