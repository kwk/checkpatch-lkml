#28: 
cause a kernel memory corruption. CLONE_NEWIPC must detach from the existing

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#72: FILE: kernel/fork.c:1686:
+	if (unshare_flags & CLONE_SYSVSEM) {
+		*new_ulistp = (void*)1;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#73: FILE: kernel/fork.c:1687:
+		*new_ulistp = (void*)1;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
