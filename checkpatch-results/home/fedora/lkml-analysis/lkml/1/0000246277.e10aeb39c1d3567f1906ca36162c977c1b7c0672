Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#55: FILE: include/linux/lockdep.h:303:
+extern void lock_set_subclass(struct lockdep_map *lock, unsigned int subclass,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

 	              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
