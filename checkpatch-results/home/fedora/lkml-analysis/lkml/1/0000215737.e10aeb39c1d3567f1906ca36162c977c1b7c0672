WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#45: FILE: drivers/w1/slaves/Kconfig:47:

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#68: FILE: drivers/w1/slaves/w1_bq27000.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#69: FILE: drivers/w1/slaves/w1_bq27000.c:2:
+ * drivers/w1/slaves/w1_bq27000.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#91: FILE: drivers/w1/slaves/w1_bq27000.c:24:
+#define HDQ_CMD_WRITE	(1<<7)
                      	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#91: FILE: drivers/w1/slaves/w1_bq27000.c:24:
+#define HDQ_CMD_WRITE	(1<<7)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#181: FILE: drivers/w1/slaves/w1_bq27000.c:114:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0400'.
#185: FILE: drivers/w1/slaves/w1_bq27000.c:118:
+module_param(F_ID, int, S_IRUSR);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
