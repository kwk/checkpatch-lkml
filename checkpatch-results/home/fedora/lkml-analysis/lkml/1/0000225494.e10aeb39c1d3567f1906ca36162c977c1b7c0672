+config MD_AUTODETECT
+	bool "Autodetect RAID arrays during kernel boot"
+	depends on BLK_DEV_MD
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  If you say Y here, then the kernel will try to autodetect raid
+	  arrays as part of its boot process. 
+
+	  If you don't use raid and say Y, this autodetection can cause 
+	  a several-second delay in the boot time due to various
+	  synchronisation steps that are part of this step.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.

 config MD_LINEAR
 	tristate "Linear (append) mode"
 	depends on BLK_DEV_MD

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after raid_noautodetect
#142: FILE: init/do_mounts_md.c:16:
+static int __initdata raid_noautodetect;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
