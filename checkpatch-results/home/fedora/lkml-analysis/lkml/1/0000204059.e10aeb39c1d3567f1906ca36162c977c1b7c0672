CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#113: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:52:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cont->parent"
#141: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1442:
+	if (cont->parent == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#158: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1523:
+__setup("noswapaccount", disable_swap_account);
