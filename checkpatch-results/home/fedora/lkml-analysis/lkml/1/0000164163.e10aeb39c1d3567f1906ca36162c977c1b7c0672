CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/percpu.h:110:
+extern void *__alloc_percpu(size_t bytes, size_t align);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#409: FILE: mm/percpu.c:728:
 		WARN(true, "illegal size (%zu) or align (%zu) for "
+		     "percpu allocation\n", bytes, align);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
