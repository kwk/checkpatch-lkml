WARNING:SIZEOF_PARENTHESIS: sizeof *device should be sizeof(*device)
#268: FILE: drivers/infiniband/ulp/iser/iser_verbs.c:249:
+	device = kzalloc(sizeof *device, GFP_KERNEL);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!device"
#269: FILE: drivers/infiniband/ulp/iser/iser_verbs.c:250:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
