#51: 
[   56.923623] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at /home/bor/src/linux-git/mm/slub.c:1599

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buf"
#118: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco.c:4948:
+		if (buf == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#129: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco.c:4952:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
