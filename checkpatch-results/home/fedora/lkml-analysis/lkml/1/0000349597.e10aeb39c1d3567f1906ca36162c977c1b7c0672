Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#105: FILE: kernel/printk.c:631:
+const char printk_recursion_bug_msg [] =

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'printk', this function's name, in a string
#106: FILE: kernel/printk.c:632:
+			KERN_CRIT "BUG: recent printk recursion!\n";

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
