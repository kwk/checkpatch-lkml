WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#58: 
#else /* everyone else */

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

#148: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/irq.c:167:
+	int irq = (vector - 0x800) >> 4;
+	handle_irq(irq);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
