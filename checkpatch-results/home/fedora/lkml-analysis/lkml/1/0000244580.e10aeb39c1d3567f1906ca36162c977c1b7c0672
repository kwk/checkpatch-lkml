ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^Iif (down && !rep && keycode == KEY_PAUSE) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#48: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:1188:
+	if (down && !rep && keycode == KEY_PAUSE) 
+        {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

spaces are never used for indentation.
