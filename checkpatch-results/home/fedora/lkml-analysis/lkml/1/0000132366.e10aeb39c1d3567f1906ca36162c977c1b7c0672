ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#80: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/dell-wmi.c:73:
+        {KE_KEY, 0xe009, KEY_EJECTCD},$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

#87: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/dell-wmi.c:80:
+	/* The next device is at offset 6, the active devices are at

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
