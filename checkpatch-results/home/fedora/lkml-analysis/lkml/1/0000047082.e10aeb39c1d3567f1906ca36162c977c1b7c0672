ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#108: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/time.c:484:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#178: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:283:
+extern void update_vsyscall(struct timespec *ts, struct clocksource *c, u32 mult);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
