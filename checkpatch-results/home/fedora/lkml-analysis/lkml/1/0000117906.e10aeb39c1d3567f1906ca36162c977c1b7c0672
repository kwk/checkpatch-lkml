CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/ptrace.h:94:
+extern void ptrace_link(struct task_struct *child, unsigned int flags,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#75: FILE: kernel/ptrace.c:44:
+void ptrace_link(struct task_struct *child, unsigned int flags,
+			struct task_struct *tracer)
