WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

 .../power/{bq27x00_battery.c => bq27200_battery.c} |   99 ++++++++++----------

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#219: FILE: drivers/power/bq27200_battery.c:167:
+#define to_bq27200_device_info(x) container_of((x), \
+				struct bq27200_device_info, bat);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
