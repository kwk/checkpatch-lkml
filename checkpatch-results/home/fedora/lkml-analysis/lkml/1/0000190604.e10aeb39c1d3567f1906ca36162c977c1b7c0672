Thanks for testing. It's exaclty the code path I described :)
                         ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#96: FILE: kernel/sched_clock.c:225:
+extern int timekeeping_suspended;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
