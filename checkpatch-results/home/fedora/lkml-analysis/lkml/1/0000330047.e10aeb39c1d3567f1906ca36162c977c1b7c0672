Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+static ssize_t min_ratio_store(struct device *dev,
+		struct device_attribute *attr, const char *buf, size_t count)

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#79: FILE: mm/backing-dev.c:61:
+	ratio = simple_strtoul(buf, &end, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
