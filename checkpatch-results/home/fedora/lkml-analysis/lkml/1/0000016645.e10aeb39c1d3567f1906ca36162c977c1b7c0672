Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*hotk)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct asus_hotk)...)
#379: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/asus-laptop.c:1410:
+	hotk = kzalloc(sizeof(struct asus_hotk), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
