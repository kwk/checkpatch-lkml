WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <GPIO11_3_6MHz_MD>
#121: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/clock.c:25:
+	pxa_gpio_mode(GPIO11_3_6MHz_MD);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#173: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/clock.c:37:
+	int cken = ((struct clk_cken_priv *)clk->priv)->cken;
+	CKEN |= 1 << cken;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#182: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/clock.c:45:
+	int cken = ((struct clk_cken_priv *)clk->priv)->cken;
+	CKEN &= ~(1 << cken);

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#224: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/clock.h:1:
+#include <linux/clklib.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#291: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/clock.h:41:
+	BUG_ON(!clk->priv);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after pxa25x_clk_funcs[]
#364: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/pxa25x.c:140:
+static struct clk_function __initdata pxa25x_clk_funcs[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
