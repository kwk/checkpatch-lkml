It's a shame kthread_stop() (may take a while!) runs with a global semaphore

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'neccesary' may be misspelled - perhaps 'necessary'?

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#61: FILE: kernel/kthread.c:32:
+	return (void*)t->set_child_tid;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
