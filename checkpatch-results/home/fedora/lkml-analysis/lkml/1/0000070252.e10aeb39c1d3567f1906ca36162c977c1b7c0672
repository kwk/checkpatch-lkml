WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 2
#447: FILE: kernel/timeconst.sh:2:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'coverting' may be misspelled - perhaps 'converting'?
#452: FILE: kernel/timeconst.sh:7:
+	echo "Generate a header file with constants for coverting between"
 	                                                ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'milisecond' may be misspelled - perhaps 'millisecond'?
#453: FILE: kernel/timeconst.sh:8:
+	echo "decimal HZ timer ticks and milisecond or microsecond delays."
 	                                 ^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#479: FILE: kernel/timeconst.sh:34:
+/* Automatically generated by kernel/timeconst.sh */

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
