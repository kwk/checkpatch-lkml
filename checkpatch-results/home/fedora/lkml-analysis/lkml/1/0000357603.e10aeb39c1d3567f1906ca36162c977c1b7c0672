ERROR: "memory_add_physaddr_to_nid" [drivers/acpi/acpi_memhotplug.ko] undefined!

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#68: FILE: arch/x86/mm/srat_64.c:565:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(memory_add_physaddr_to_nid);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#99: FILE: mm/sparse.c:66:
+static struct mem_section noinline __meminit *sparse_index_alloc(int nid)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#123: FILE: mm/sparse-vmemmap.c:36:
+void __init_refok *__call_alloc_bootmem(int node,
+			int size, int align, int goal)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#128: FILE: mm/sparse-vmemmap.c:41:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
