CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#140: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c:445:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#270: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c:1315:
+ * and everything is OK. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
