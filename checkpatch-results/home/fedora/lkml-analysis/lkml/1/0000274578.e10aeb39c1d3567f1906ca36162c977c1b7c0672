CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#103: FILE: include/asm-x86/nmi.h:41:
+extern void nmi_watchdog_default(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#105: FILE: include/asm-x86/nmi.h:43:
+#define nmi_watchdog_default(void) do {} while (0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
