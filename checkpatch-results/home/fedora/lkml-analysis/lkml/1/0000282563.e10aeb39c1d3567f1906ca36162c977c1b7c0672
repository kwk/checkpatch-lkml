WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#38: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .3
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#115: FILE: arch/x86/pci/common.c:380:
 struct pci_bus * __devinit pcibios_scan_root(int busnum)

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#133: FILE: arch/x86/pci/init.c:35:
+ ^Idmi_check_pciprobe();$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#133: FILE: arch/x86/pci/init.c:35:
+ ^Idmi_check_pciprobe();$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#133: FILE: arch/x86/pci/init.c:35:
+ ^Idmi_check_pciprobe();$

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#146: FILE: arch/x86/pci/pci.h:42:
+extern void __init dmi_check_pciprobe(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#214: FILE: drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c:964:
+		if (cx.type == ACPI_STATE_C1) {
+			cx.valid = 1;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#243: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43/b43.h:633:
+	 * might sync with TX by write_lock_irqsave()'ing. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'seperate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'separate'?
#297: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c:2608:
+	/* Transmissions on seperate queues can run concurrently. */
 	                    ^^^^^^^^

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#383: FILE: fs/reiserfs/ioctl.c:141:
+int reiserfs_unpack(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
                                                       ^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#403: FILE: fs/reiserfs/super.c:2034:
+	inode = nd.path.dentry->d_inode;
 	        ^^

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#414: FILE: fs/reiserfs/super.c:2040:
+			reiserfs_warning(sb,
+				"reiserfs: Unpacking tail of quota file failed"

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#415: FILE: fs/reiserfs/super.c:2041:
+				"reiserfs: Unpacking tail of quota file failed"
+				" (%d). Cannot turn on quotas.", err);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#416: FILE: fs/reiserfs/super.c:2042:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#487: FILE: include/linux/reiserfs_fs.h:2179:

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'z->zone_start_pfn <= pfn'
#629: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2555:
+		if ((z->zone_start_pfn <= pfn)
+		    && (pfn < z->zone_start_pfn + z->spanned_pages)
+		    && !(pfn & (pageblock_nr_pages - 1)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#630: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2556:
+		if ((z->zone_start_pfn <= pfn)
+		    && (pfn < z->zone_start_pfn + z->spanned_pages)

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#631: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2557:
