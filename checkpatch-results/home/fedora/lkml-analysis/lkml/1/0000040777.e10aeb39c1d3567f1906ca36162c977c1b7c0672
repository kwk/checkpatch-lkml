CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#120: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:497:
+extern int tty_audit_push_task(struct task_struct *tsk,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#131: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:516:
 }
+static inline int tty_audit_push_task(struct task_struct *tsk,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
