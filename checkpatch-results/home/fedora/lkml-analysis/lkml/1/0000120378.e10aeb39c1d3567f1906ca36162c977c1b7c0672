CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sym"
#105: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:379:
+			if (sym == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#120: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:390:
