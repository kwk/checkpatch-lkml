#61: 
How about this ? (just an exmaple and not tested, sorry)
                          ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#158: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:689:
+			    list_first_entry(&root_mem->css.cgroup->children,
+					struct cgroup, sibling);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#164: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:694:
+	} else /* get_next_node will manage refcnt */

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
