Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#126: FILE: include/linux/percpu.h:77:
+extern ssize_t __init pcpu_page_first_chunk(

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
