WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#67: FILE: include/linux/dma-attrs.h:1:
+#ifndef _DMA_ATTR_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while loop
#83: FILE: include/linux/dma-attrs.h:17:
+#define INIT_DMA_ATTRS(x) (x)->flags = 0;

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#83: FILE: include/linux/dma-attrs.h:17:
+#define INIT_DMA_ATTRS(x) (x)->flags = 0;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#111: FILE: include/linux/dma-attrs.h:45:
+		int ret = attrs->flags & (1 << attr);
+		return !!ret;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
