CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

[...]
+					last_map_addr = (pfn << PAGE_SHIFT) + PAGE_SIZE;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

+early_param("userpte", setup_userpte);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#441: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:268:
+extern int page_is_ram(unsigned long pfn);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
