working console when you diable the PVFB.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#150: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_console.h:58:
+extern void hvc_force_consdev(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#153: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_console.h:61:
 extern struct hvc_struct * __devinit hvc_alloc(uint32_t vtermno, int irq,

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#171: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_xen.c:108:
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG "hvc xen_init()\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'xen_init', this function's name, in a string
#171: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_xen.c:108:
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG "hvc xen_init()\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
