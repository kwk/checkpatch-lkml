Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#121: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:700:
+	if (sh->reconstruct_state == reconstruct_state_drain_run)
[...]
+	else if (sh->reconstruct_state == reconstruct_state_prexor_drain_run)

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#126: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:705:
+		BUG_ON(sh->reconstruct_state != reconstruct_state_run);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
