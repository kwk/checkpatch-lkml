ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#112: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode.c:248:
*dev,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#210: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode.c:351:
+	BUG_ON(raw_smp_processor_id() != cpu);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#219: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode.c:360:
+^I} else {^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

 		printk(KERN_ERR "microcode: CPU%d update from revision "
+			"0x%x to 0x%x failed\n", cpu_num, uci->cpu_sig.rev, val[1]);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#643: FILE: include/asm-x86/microcode.h:1:
+#ifndef ASM_X86__MICROCODE_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#684: FILE: include/asm-x86/microcode.h:97:
 };
+extern struct ucode_cpu_info ucode_cpu_info[];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
