WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#105: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:342:
+	if(lock_timer(timr->it_id, &flags) == NULL) {
+		return ret;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!lock_timer"
#105: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:342:
+	if(lock_timer(timr->it_id, &flags) == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
