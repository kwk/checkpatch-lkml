WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#110: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:359:
+extern void async_thread_helper(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#115: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:364:
+int create_async_thread(int (*fn)(void *), void * arg, unsigned long flags)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
