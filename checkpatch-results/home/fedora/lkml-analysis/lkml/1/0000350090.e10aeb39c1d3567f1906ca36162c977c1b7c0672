Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
