WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Do not use whitespace before Signed-off-by:
#41: 
    Signed-off-by: Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '__nv_nic_irq', this function's name, in a string
#66: FILE: drivers/net/forcedeth.c:2947:
+	dprintk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: __nv_nic_irq\n", dev->name);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#236: FILE: drivers/net/forcedeth.c:3066:
+	struct net_device *dev = data;
+	return __nv_nic_irq(dev, false);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#243: FILE: drivers/net/forcedeth.c:3072:
