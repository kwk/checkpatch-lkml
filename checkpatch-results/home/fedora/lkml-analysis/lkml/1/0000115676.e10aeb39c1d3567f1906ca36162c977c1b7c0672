Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#73: FILE: drivers/s390/char/vmlogrdr.c:682:
+static struct dev_pm_ops vmlogrdr_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
