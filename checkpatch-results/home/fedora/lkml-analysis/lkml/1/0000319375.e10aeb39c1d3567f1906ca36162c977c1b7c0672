#42: 
Explicit timing delay is only needed in pcspkr for accesses to the 8253 PIT.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#99: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/i8253.c:40:
+	/* delay for some accesses to PIC on motherboard or in chipset must be
+	   at least one microsecond, but be safe here. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern unsigned char inb_pit(unsigned int port);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
