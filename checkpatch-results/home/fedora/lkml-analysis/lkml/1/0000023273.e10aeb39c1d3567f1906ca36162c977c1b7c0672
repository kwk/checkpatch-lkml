CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#95: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_kprobe.c:1526:
+		if (WARN_ON_ONCE(tp == NULL)) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tp"
#95: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_kprobe.c:1526:
+		if (WARN_ON_ONCE(tp == NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
