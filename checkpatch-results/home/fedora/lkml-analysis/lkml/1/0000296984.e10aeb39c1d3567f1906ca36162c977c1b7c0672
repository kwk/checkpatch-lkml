#40: 
Convert MPC i2c driver from a platform_driver to a of_platform_driver. Add the ability to dynamically load i2c drivers based on device tree names. Routine names were changed from fsl_ to mpc_ to make them match the file name. Common code moved to of-common.* Orginal ppc driver left intact for deletion when ppc arch is removed.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Orginal' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Original'?
