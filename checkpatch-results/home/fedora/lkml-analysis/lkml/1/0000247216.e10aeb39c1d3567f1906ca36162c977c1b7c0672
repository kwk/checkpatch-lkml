WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#133: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic_64.c:158:
+DEFINE_DYN_ARRAY(irq_2_pin, sizeof(struct irq_pin_list), pin_map_size, sizeof(struct irq_pin_list), NULL);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
