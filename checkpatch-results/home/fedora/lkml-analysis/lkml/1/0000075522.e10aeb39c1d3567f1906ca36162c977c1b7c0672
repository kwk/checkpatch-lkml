CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "filter"
#75: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:490:
+	if (attr->type == PERF_TYPE_TRACEPOINT && filter != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#77: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:492:
+		ret = ioctl(fd[nr_cpu][counter],
+				PERF_COUNTER_IOC_SET_FILTER, filter);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+static int tracepoint_event_set_flags(const char *flags,
+				     struct perf_counter_attr *attr)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#148: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.c:458:
+	if (!flags)
[...]

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
