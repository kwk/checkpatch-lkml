ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#68: FILE: drivers/net/bonding/bond_sysfs.c:94:
+	if (res) buf[res-1] = '\n'; /* eat the leftover space */

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
