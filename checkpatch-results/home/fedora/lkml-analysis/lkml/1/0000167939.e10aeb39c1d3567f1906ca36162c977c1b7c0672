CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!trace->selftest"
#59: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:463:
+	if (trace->selftest == NULL || tracing_selftest_disabled)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#88: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:492:
+	if (ret)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
