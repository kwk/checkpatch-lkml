Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#110: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h:111:
+#define _TIF_NOSUID		(1 << TIF_NOSUID)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#181: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1584:
+			const struct cred *cred = current->cred;
+			error = -EINVAL;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#183: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1586:
+			if (	(cred->uid != cred->suid) ||

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cred->uid != cred->suid'
#183: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1586:

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
