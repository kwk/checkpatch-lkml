WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#61: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:3612:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#80: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:715:
+extern void end_entire_request(struct request *req, int uptodate);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
