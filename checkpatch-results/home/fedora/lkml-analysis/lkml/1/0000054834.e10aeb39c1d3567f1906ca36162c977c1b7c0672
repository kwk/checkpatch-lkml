WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#93: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:51:

                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#112: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:80:
+					 * value */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'contol' may be misspelled - perhaps 'control'?
#113: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:81:
+	__u32			mcr;	/* modem contol register value */
 	     			    	         ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#122: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:90:
+			     unsigned reg, __u8 val)

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#134: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:102:
+			    unsigned reg, unsigned char *buf)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#156: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:536:
+	if (retval == 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#157: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:537:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "%s:"

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#161: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ark3116.c:541:
