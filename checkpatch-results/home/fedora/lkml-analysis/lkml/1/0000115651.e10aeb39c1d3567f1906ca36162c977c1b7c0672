WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#82: FILE: drivers/s390/net/netiucv.c:164:
+static struct dev_pm_ops netiucv_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
#120: FILE: drivers/s390/net/netiucv.c:1300:
+	return;
+}

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*netiucv_dev)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct device)...)
#201: FILE: drivers/s390/net/netiucv.c:2217:
+	netiucv_dev = kzalloc(sizeof(struct device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
