WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#140: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1424:
+		 * under KVM
+		*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#195: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1455:
+	if (x2apic_preenabled) {
[...]
+	} else if (cpu_has_x2apic)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
