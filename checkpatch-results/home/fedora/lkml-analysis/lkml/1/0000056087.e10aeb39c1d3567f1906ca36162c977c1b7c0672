Subject: [PATCH 7/9] bas_gigaset: checkpatch cleanup

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#63: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/bas-gigaset.c:604:
+			     (unsigned char *) &ucs->dr_cmd_in,

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ucs->rcvbuf"
#93: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/bas-gigaset.c:745:
+		if (ucs->rcvbuf == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#156: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/bas-gigaset.c:1574:
+			     (unsigned char *) &ucs->dr_ctrl, NULL, 0,

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cb->next"
#195: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/bas-gigaset.c:1712:
+	if (cb->next != NULL) {

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#209: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/bas-gigaset.c:1844:
+			     (unsigned char *) &ucs->dr_cmd_out, buf, len,

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*cb)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct cmdbuf_t)...)
#218: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/bas-gigaset.c:1964:
+	cb = kmalloc(sizeof(struct cmdbuf_t) + len, GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*ubc->isooutbuf)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct isowbuf_t)...)
#228: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/bas-gigaset.c:2112:
+	ubc->isooutbuf = kmalloc(sizeof(struct isowbuf_t), GFP_KERNEL);

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bInterfaceNumber>
#238: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/bas-gigaset.c:2265:
+		if (usb_set_interface(udev, hostif->desc.bInterfaceNumber, 3)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!driver"
#272: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/bas-gigaset.c:2543:
+	if (driver == NULL)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#391: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/isocdata.c:424:
+	 * (complemented, least significant byte first) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
