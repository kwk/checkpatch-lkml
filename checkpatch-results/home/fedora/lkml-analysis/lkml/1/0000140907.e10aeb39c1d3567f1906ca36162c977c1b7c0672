#47: 
The following changes since commit 7fd61bdf06572f1ca681aa35f5c86531a821ea75:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#102: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/hw_irq.h:84:
+extern void smp_generic_interrupt(struct pt_regs *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pt_regs *' should also have an identifier name
#102: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/hw_irq.h:84:
+extern void smp_generic_interrupt(struct pt_regs *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pt_regs *' should also have an identifier name
#173: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/syscalls.h:23:
+int sys_fork(struct pt_regs *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pt_regs *' should also have an identifier name
#174: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/syscalls.h:24:
+int sys_vfork(struct pt_regs *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pt_regs *' should also have an identifier name
#180: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/syscalls.h:30:
+long sys_rt_sigreturn(struct pt_regs *);

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#352: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init.c:1:
+#include <linux/initrd.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.
