Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:740:
+extern void ata_scsi_media_change_notify(struct ata_device *atadev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
