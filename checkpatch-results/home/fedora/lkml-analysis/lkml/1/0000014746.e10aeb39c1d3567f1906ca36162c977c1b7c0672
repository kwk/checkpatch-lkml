WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#23: 
#define dbg adds the newline, messages shouldn't.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 131 exceeds 100 columns
#103: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/io_edgeport.c:2010:
+			dbg("%s ========== Port %u CHECK_RSP Sequence = %02x =============", __func__, edge_serial->rxPort, byte3);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
