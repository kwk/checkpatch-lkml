ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#52: FILE: drivers/w1/w1.c:82:
=20

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#59: FILE: drivers/w1/w1.c:86:
+		dev_dbg(dev, "Waiting for %s to become free: refcnt=3D%d.\n",
 				sl->name, atomic_read(&sl->refcnt));

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'w1_search', this function's name, in a string
#68: FILE: drivers/w1/w1.c:913:
+				dev_dbg(&dev->dev, "Abort w1_search\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
