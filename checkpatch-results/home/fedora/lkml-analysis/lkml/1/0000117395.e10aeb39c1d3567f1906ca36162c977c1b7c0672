For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

#806: FILE: net/ieee802154/af_ieee802154.c:312:
+	.type = __constant_htons(ETH_P_IEEE802154),

Use of __constant_<foo> form is discouraged for the following functions::

  __constant_cpu_to_be[x]
  __constant_cpu_to_le[x]
  __constant_be[x]_to_cpu
  __constant_le[x]_to_cpu
  __constant_htons
  __constant_ntohs

Using any of these outside of include/uapi/ is not preferred as using the
function without __constant_ is identical when the argument is a
constant.

In big endian systems, the macros like __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) and
cpu_to_be32(x) expand to the same expression::

  #define __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) ((__force __be32)(__u32)(x))
  #define __cpu_to_be32(x)          ((__force __be32)(__u32)(x))

In little endian systems, the macros __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) and
cpu_to_be32(x) expand to __constant_swab32 and __swab32.  __swab32
has a __builtin_constant_p check::

  #define __swab32(x)				\
    (__builtin_constant_p((__u32)(x)) ?	\
    ___constant_swab32(x) :			\
    __fswab32(x))

So ultimately they have a special case for constants.
Similar is the case with all of the macros in the list.  Thus
using the __constant_... forms are unnecessarily verbose and
not preferred outside of include/uapi.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
