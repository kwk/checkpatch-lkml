CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#56: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/xen/hypervisor.h:48:
+extern void xen_guest_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#103: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1187:
+	uint32_t base, eax, ebx, ecx, edx;

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#108: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1192:
+		*(uint32_t*)(signature + 0) = ebx;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#157: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1241:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#163: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1247:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#168: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1252:
+	/* Don't do the full vcpu_info placement stuff until we have a
+	   possible map and a non-dummy shared_info. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#168: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1252:
+	   possible map and a non-dummy shared_info. */
