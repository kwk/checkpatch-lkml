WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#75: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/mxc_w1.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#89: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/mxc_w1.c:15:
+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#106: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/mxc_w1.c:32:
+ * 1350us. We set the timeout to 500*100us = 50ms for sure */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#144: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/mxc_w1.c:70:
+		if (((reg_val >> 7) & 0x1) == 0 ||
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return

#151: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/mxc_w1.c:77:

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*mdev)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct mxc_w1_device)...)
#190: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/mxc_w1.c:116:
+	mdev = kzalloc(sizeof(struct mxc_w1_device) +

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+				"mxc_w1");

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#212: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/mxc_w1.c:138:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
