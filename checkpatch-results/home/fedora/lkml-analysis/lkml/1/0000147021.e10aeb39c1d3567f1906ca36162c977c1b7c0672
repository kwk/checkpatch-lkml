Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#100: FILE: fs/inode.c:1539:
umode_t mode, dev_t rdev)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#106: FILE: fs/inode.c:1543:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (%o) for"

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'init_special_inode', this function's name, in a string
#106: FILE: fs/inode.c:1543:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (%o) for"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#107: FILE: fs/inode.c:1544:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (%o) for"
+				  " inode %s:%lu\n", mode, inode->i_sb->s_id,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
