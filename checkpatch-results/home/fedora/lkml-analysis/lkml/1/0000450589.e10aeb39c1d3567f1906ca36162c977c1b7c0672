When porting part of Ingo's work, I realized that a similar thing can be do=

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#147: FILE: arch/um/kernel/skas/mmu.c:128:
+		printk("init_new_context_skas - unmap failed, "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'init_new_context_skas', this function's name, in a string
#147: FILE: arch/um/kernel/skas/mmu.c:128:
+		printk("init_new_context_skas - unmap failed, "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#148: FILE: arch/um/kernel/skas/mmu.c:129:
+		printk("init_new_context_skas - unmap failed, "
+		       "errno = %d; continuing\n", ret);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#169: FILE: arch/um/kernel/tlb.c:148:
+	 * must be done */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
