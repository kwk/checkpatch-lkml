CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#64: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/genapic_flat_64.c:323:
 struct genapic apic_physflat =  {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <dest_Fixed>
#70: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/genapic_flat_64.c:329:
+	.int_delivery_mode		= dest_Fixed,

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#101: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/genapic_flat_64.c:360:
+	.apic_id_mask			= 0xFFu<<24,
 	             			       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
