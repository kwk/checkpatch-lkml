+menuconfig INSTRUMENTATION
+	bool "Instrumentation Support"
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  Say Y here to get to see options related to performance measurement,
+	  system-wide debugging, and testing. This option alone does not add any
+	  kernel code.
+
+	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and
+	  disabled. If you're trying to debug the kernel itself, go see the
+	  Kernel Hacking menu.

+	help
+	  Say Y here to enable the extended profiling support mechanisms used
+	  by profilers such as OProfile.

+	help
+	  OProfile is a profiling system capable of profiling the
+	  whole system, include the kernel, kernel modules, libraries,
+	  and applications.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.

+	bool "Kprobes"
+	depends on KALLSYMS && MODULES
+	depends on X86_32 || IA64 || PPC || S390 || SPARC64 || X86_64 || AVR32
+	help
+	  Kprobes allows you to trap at almost any kernel address and
+	  execute a callback function.  register_kprobe() establishes
+	  a probepoint and specifies the callback.  Kprobes is useful
+	  for kernel debugging, non-intrusive instrumentation and testing.
+	  If in doubt, say "N".
+
+config MARKERS
+	bool "Activate markers"
+	help
+	  Place an empty function call at each marker site. Can be
+	  dynamically changed for a probe function.
