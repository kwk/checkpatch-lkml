WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#38: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#43: FILE: fs/unionfs/subr.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#74: FILE: fs/unionfs/subr.c:32:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LIKELY_MISUSE: nested (un)?likely() calls, IS_ERR already uses unlikely() internally

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#107: FILE: fs/unionfs/subr.c:65:
+				int ret = PTR_ERR(lower_dentry);
+				if (!IS_COPYUP_ERR(ret))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRWXUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0777'.
#140: FILE: fs/unionfs/subr.c:98:
+					 ~current->fs->umask & S_IRWXUGO,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#175: FILE: fs/unionfs/subr.c:133:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
