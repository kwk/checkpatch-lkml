Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'balance_dirty_pages', this function's name, in a string
#100: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:424:
+               printk(KERN_DEBUG "balance_dirty_pages for %s written %lu %lu congested %d "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
