CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#51: FILE: arch/arm/common/sharpsl_pm.c:549:
 {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#79: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/pm.c:24:
+extern  int pxa27x_cpu_pm_prepare(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#97: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/pm.c:54:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
