WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#31: 
Rather than just jumping to 0 when there's a missing operation, raise a BUG.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#47: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:437:
+config PARAVIRT_DEBUG
+       bool "paravirt-ops debugging"
+       depends on PARAVIRT && DEBUG_KERNEL
+       help
+         Enable to debug paravirt_ops internals.  Specifically, BUG if
+	 a paravirt_op is missing when it is called.
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#64: FILE: include/asm-x86/paravirt.h:464:
+#define PVOP_TEST_NULL(op)	BUG_ON(op == NULL)

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'op' may be better as '(op)' to avoid precedence issues
#64: FILE: include/asm-x86/paravirt.h:464:
+#define PVOP_TEST_NULL(op)	BUG_ON(op == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!op"
#64: FILE: include/asm-x86/paravirt.h:464:
+#define PVOP_TEST_NULL(op)	BUG_ON(op == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
