WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#147: FILE: block/blk-core.c:1709:
+	BUG_ON(blk_rq_bytes(rq) && !bytes);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'attributs' may be misspelled - perhaps 'attributes'?
#249: FILE: block/blk-merge.c:334:
+	 * Distributes the attributs to each bio.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#310: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:152:
+#define REQ_MIXED_MERGE	(1 << __REQ_MIXED_MERGE)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#337: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:864:
+extern unsigned int blk_rq_err_bytes(const struct request *rq);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
