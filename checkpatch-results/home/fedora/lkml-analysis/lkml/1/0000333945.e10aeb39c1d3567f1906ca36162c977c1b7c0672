WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#77: FILE: fs/gfs2/inode.h:32:
+	const struct gfs2_sbd *sdp = GFS2_SB(&ip->i_inode);
+	return (sdp->sd_args.ar_data == GFS2_DATA_ORDERED) && !gfs2_is_jdata(ip);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#203: FILE: fs/gfs2/ops_address.c:892:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#221: FILE: fs/gfs2/ops_address.h:23:
+extern void gfs2_set_aops(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
