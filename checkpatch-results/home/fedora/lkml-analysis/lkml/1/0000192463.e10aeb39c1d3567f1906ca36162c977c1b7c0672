CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#48: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/amd_iommu_types.h:195:
+#define PD_DEFAULT_MASK		(1UL << 1) /* domain is a default dma_ops

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#49: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/amd_iommu_types.h:196:
+#define PD_DEFAULT_MASK		(1UL << 1) /* domain is a default dma_ops
+					      domain for an IOMMU */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
