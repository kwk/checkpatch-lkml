WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#81: 
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#243: FILE: include/asm-x86/page_32.h:68:
+extern unsigned long __phys_addr(unsigned long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#273: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#278: FILE: include/linux/mmdebug.h:1:
+#ifndef LINUX_MM_DEBUG_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#284: FILE: include/linux/mmdebug.h:7:
+#define VM_BUG_ON(cond) BUG_ON(cond)

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#286: FILE: include/linux/mmdebug.h:9:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

+	help
+	  Enable some costly sanity checks in virtual to page code. This can

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#325: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:184:
+	 * architectures that do not vmalloc module space */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
