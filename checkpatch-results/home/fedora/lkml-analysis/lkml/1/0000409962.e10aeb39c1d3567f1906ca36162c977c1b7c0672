CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:27:
+extern int mem_container_charge(struct page *page, struct mm_struct *mm);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#136: FILE: mm/filemap.c:447:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#188: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:96:
+void __always_inline lock_meta_page(struct page *page)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*mp)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct meta_page)...)
#228: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:136:
+	mp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct meta_page), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mp"
#229: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:137:
+	if (mp == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
