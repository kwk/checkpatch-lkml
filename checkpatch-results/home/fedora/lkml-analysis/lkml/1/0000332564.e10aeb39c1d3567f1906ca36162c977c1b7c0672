The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#131: FILE: arch/x86/lib/gup.c:10:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 124 exceeds 100 columns
#138: FILE: arch/x86/lib/gup.c:17:
+static noinline int gup_pte_range(pmd_t pmd, unsigned long addr, unsigned long end, int write, struct page **pages, int *nr)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
