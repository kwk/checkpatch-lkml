WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'algorith' may be misspelled - perhaps 'algorithm'?
#33: 
This patch adds an algorith to check the following condition:
                   ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/writeback.h:108:
+extern unsigned long determine_dirtyable_memory(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#95: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2490:
+			(val + (ENTRIES_PER_PAGE-1)) / ENTRIES_PER_PAGE;
 			                        ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'useable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'usable'?
#108: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2503:
+		/* we only allow to request 1/4 of useable memory */
 		                                   ^^^^^^^

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#132: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2702:
+	unsigned pages_allocated = 0;

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'numebr' may be misspelled - perhaps 'number'?
#197: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:290:
+ * Returns the numebr of pages that can currently be freed and used
                ^^^^^^
