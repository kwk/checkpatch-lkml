The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*smb_cmi)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct acpi_smbus_cmi)...)
#377: FILE: drivers/acpi/cmi_i2c.c:295:
+	smb_cmi = kzalloc(sizeof(struct acpi_smbus_cmi), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
