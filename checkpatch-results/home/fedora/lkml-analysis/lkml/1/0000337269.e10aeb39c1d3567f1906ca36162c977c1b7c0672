+static void ide_floppy_io_buffers(ide_drive_t *drive, idefloppy_pc_t *pc,

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#115: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:355:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: leftover data in idefloppy_output_buffers,"

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'idefloppy_output_buffers', this function's name, in a string
#115: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:355:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: leftover data in idefloppy_output_buffers,"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#116: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:356:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: leftover data in idefloppy_output_buffers,"
+			" bcount == %d\n", drive->name, bcount);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
