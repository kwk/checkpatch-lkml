WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#60: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:305:
+	BUG_ON(desc->action != new || new->next);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#70: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:315:
+	if (new->flags & IRQF_TRIGGER_MASK) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#79: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:324:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "No IRQF_TRIGGER set_type "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#80: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:325:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "No IRQF_TRIGGER set_type "
+			       "function for IRQ %d (%s)\n", irq,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
