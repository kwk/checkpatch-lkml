CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#166: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:108:
+extern int freeze_processes(unsigned long freeze_event);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#167: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:109:
+extern void thaw_processes(unsigned long freeze_event);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#177: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:172:
+static inline int freeze_processes(int a) { BUG(); return 1; }

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#191: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:27:
+static inline int freezeable(struct task_struct * p, unsigned long freeze_event)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
