#73: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/omap1_bl.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#74: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/omap1_bl.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#91: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/omap1_bl.c:19:

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#116: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/omap1_bl.c:44:
+static void inline omapbl_send_intensity(int intensity)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct backlight_ops should normally be const
#206: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/omap1_bl.c:134:
+static struct backlight_ops omapbl_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*bl)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct omap_backlight)...)
#223: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/omap1_bl.c:151:
+	bl = kzalloc(sizeof(struct omap_backlight), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
