CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#68: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/mmu_context.h:26:
+# include <asm/atomic.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

+   MicroBlaze has 256 contexts, so we can just rotate through these

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#110: FILE: arch/microblaze/include/asm/mmu_context.h:68:
+extern void set_context(mm_context_t context, pgd_t *pgd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
