CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/oom.h:29:
+extern unsigned long out_of_memory(struct zonelist *zonelist, gfp_t gfp_mask,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#153: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:396:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#206: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:458:

 				"Memory cgroup out of memory"))
