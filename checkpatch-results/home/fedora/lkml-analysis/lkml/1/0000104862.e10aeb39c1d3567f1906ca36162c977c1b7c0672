#39: 
The Intel IOMMU identity mapping uses e820 to walk the memory map. This causes

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after identity_mapped
#79: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/pci-dma.c:127:
+static int __initdata identity_mapped = 1;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
