ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#55: 
--- a/arch/sparc64/kernel/systbls.S~timerfd-v3-new-timerfd-api-sparc64-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#62: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/systbls.S:83:
+/*310*/	.word compat_sys_utimensat, compat_sys_signalfd, sys_ni_syscall, sys_eventfd, compat_sys_fallocate

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
