WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#55: FILE: drivers/net/can/Kconfig:38:
+config CAN_SJA1000
+	depends on CAN_DEV
+	tristate "Philips SJA1000"
+	---help---
+	  The SJA1000 is one of the top CAN controllers out there. As it
+	  has a multiplexed interface it fits directly to 8051
+	  microcontrollers or into the PC I/O port space. The SJA1000
+	  is a full CAN controller, with shadow registers for RX and TX.
+	  It can send and receive any kinds of CAN frames (SFF/EFF/RTR)
+	  with a single (simple) filter setup.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#221: FILE: drivers/net/can/sja1000/sja1000.c:123:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
