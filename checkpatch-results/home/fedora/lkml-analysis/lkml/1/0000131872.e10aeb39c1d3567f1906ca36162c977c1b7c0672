WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#186: FILE: include/linux/inotify.h:115:
+extern void inotify_reclassify_lock(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
