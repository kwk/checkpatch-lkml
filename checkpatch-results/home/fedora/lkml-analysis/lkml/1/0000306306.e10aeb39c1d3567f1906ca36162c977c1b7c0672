Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#172: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:542:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
