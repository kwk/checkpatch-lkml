Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

+	 * with the skb's link layer header preserved. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#356: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/i4l.c:94:
+		ack_header[0] = ack_header[1] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#377: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/i4l.c:124:
+	len = ack_header[0] + ((unsigned) ack_header[1] << 8);

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#377: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/i4l.c:124:
+	len = ack_header[0] + ((unsigned) ack_header[1] << 8);
