WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after acpi_dmi_table_late[]
#79: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:1605:
+static struct dmi_system_id __initdata acpi_dmi_table_late[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#87: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:1734:
+        /* those are executed after early-quirks are executed */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
