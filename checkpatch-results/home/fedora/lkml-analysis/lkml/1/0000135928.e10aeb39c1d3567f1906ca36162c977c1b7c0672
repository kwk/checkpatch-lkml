      block: enable by default support for large devices and files on 32-bit archs

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*bio)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct bio)...)
#526: FILE: fs/bio.c:372:
+	bio = kmalloc(sizeof(struct bio) + nr_iovecs * sizeof(struct bio_vec),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#594: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:149:
+#define REQ_IO_STAT	(1 << __REQ_IO_STAT)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#642: FILE: lib/scatterlist.c:351:
+		if (--miter->__nents) {
[...]
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
