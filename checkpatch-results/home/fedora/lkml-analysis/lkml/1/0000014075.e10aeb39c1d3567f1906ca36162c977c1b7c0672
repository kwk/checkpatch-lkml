CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#144: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capi.c:307:
+	mp = np->minorp = capiminor_alloc(&cdev->ap, np->ncci);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#164: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capi.c:328:
+			printk(KERN_DEBUG "reset mp->nccip\n");
