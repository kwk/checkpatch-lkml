WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#77: FILE: fs/super.c:950:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(kern_mount_data);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#85: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:133:
+#define MS_KERNMOUNT	(1<<25) /* this is a kern_mount call */
                     	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#85: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:133:
+#define MS_KERNMOUNT	(1<<25) /* this is a kern_mount call */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#94: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1494:
+extern struct vfsmount *kern_mount_data(struct file_system_type *, void *data);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file_system_type *' should also have an identifier name
#94: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1494:
+extern struct vfsmount *kern_mount_data(struct file_system_type *, void *data);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
