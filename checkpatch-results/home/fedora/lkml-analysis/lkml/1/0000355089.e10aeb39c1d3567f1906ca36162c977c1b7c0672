The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#138: FILE: arch/x86/ia32/sys_ia32.c:906:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
