WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Non-standard signature: 'NACK-ed-by:' - perhaps 'Acked-by:'?

NACK-ed-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ops"
#291: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_sched_switch.c:71:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
