ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#139: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:1392:
+	if ((err = kobject_add(&rdev->kobj, &mddev->kobj, "dev-%s", b)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#152: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:1087:
+	if (0 != kobject_add(&port->kobject, &dev->dev.kobj, "veth_port"))

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#180: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:83:
+extern int __must_check kobject_add(struct kobject *kobj,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
