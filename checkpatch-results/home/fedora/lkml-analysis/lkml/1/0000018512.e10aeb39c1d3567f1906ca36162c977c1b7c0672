WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#127: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#454: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:2575:
+DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_RESUME_EARLY(PCI_VENDOR_ID_RICOH, PCI_DEVICE_ID_RICOH_RL5C476, ricoh_mmc_fixup_rl5c476);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
