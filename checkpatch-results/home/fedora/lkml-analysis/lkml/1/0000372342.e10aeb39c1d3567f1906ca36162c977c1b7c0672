CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#72: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_fc.c:3256:
+fc_request_wwn(struct Scsi_Host *shost, u64 *wwn)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct Scsi_Host *' should also have an identifier name
#106: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_transport_fc.h:737:
+int fc_request_wwn(struct Scsi_Host *, u64 *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'u64 *' should also have an identifier name
#106: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_transport_fc.h:737:
+int fc_request_wwn(struct Scsi_Host *, u64 *);
