Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#105: FILE: net/core/netpoll.c:795:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
