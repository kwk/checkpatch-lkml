CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SetNewPageUptodate>
#160: FILE: include/linux/page-flags.h:181:
+static inline void SetNewPageUptodate(struct page *page)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#200: FILE: mm/memory.c:1466:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#344: FILE: mm/page_io.c:137:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
