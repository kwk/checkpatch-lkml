Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+MODULE_PARM_DESC(mtddev,

#94: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtdoops.c:52:
+MODULE_PARM_DESC(dump_oops,

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#173: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtdoops.c:301:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#393: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtdoops.c:444:

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
