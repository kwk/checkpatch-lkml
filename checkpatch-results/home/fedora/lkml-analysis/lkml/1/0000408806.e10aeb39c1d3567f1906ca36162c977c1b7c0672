CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#147: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:184:
+extern void FASTCALL(lru_demote(struct page *));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#147: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:184:
+extern void FASTCALL(lru_demote(struct page *));

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#178: FILE: mm/readahead.c:455:
+	unsigned nr_pages, i;

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#192: FILE: mm/readahead.c:480:
+	if (ra->size == ra->ra_pages) do {

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#194: FILE: mm/readahead.c:482:
+		nr_pages = find_get_pages(mapping,
+				demote_idx, ARRAY_SIZE(pages), pages);
