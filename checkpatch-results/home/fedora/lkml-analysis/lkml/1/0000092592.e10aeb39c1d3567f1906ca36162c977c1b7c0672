WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#83: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:3013:
+static struct dev_pm_ops serial8250_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
