Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!argv[argc]"
#234: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-probe.c:109:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#272: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-probe.c:147:
+		if (ptr) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#381: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-probe.c:256:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
