WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#51: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlm/dlmthread.c:169:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#56: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlm/dlmthread.c:174:

+		     "being remastered\n", dlm->name, res->lockname.len,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
