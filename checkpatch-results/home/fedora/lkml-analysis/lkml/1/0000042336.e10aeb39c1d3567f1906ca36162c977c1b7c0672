#36: 
Minimal changes to the core input system. The bulk of IR support loads as a module. These changes are passive if the rest of IR isn't loaded.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 112 exceeds 100 columns
#131: FILE: include/linux/input.h:83:
+#define EVIOIRSEND		_IOC(_IOC_WRITE, 'E', 0x80, sizeof(struct ir_command))	/* send an IR command */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
