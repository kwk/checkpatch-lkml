WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#169: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:324:
+	struct sysfs_dirent *sd = arg;
+	return inode->i_ino == sd->s_ino;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#219: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:361:
+	if (inode && !(inode->i_state & I_NEW)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#283: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:425:
+	BUG_ON(sd->s_sibling || (sd->s_flags & SYSFS_FLAG_REMOVED));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#318: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:460:
+			inode->i_ctime = inode->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.
