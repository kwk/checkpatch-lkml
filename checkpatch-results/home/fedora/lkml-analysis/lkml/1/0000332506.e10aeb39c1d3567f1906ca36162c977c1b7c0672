WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#110: FILE: scripts/kconfig/menu.c:337:
+			 * propagated. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#126: FILE: scripts/kconfig/menu.c:353:
+						struct symbol *es = prop_get_symbol(prop);
+						dep2 = expr_alloc_symbol(menu->sym);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
