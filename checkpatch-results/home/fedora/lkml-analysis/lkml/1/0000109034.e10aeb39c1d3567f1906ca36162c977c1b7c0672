ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#42: FILE: fs/fcntl.c:199:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#54: FILE: fs/fcntl.c:209:
+			const struct cred *cred = current_cred();
+			filp->f_owner.uid = cred->uid;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
