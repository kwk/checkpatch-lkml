CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#103: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1077:
+extern unsigned long mmap_region(struct file *file, unsigned long addr,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#104: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1078:
+extern unsigned long mmap_region(struct file *file, unsigned long addr,
+	unsigned long len, unsigned long flags,
