CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#154: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:1064:
+	if (base_x < base_boot) {
[...]
+	} else if (base_x == base_boot)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#156: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:1066:
+		int delta;
+		delta = mp_gsi_routing[boot_ioapic_idx].gsi_end + 1;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#228: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic/io_apic.c:1036:
+			i = irq = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
