>> input. Is there any kind of input API function to obtain the device bitmaps?

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#105: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:385:
+	unsigned int *keycode = data;
+	input_inject_event(handle, EV_KEY, *keycode, 0);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#110: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:390:
+void kbd_dbg_clear_keys(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#208: FILE: include/linux/kdb.h:97:
+extern void kdb_clear_keys(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
