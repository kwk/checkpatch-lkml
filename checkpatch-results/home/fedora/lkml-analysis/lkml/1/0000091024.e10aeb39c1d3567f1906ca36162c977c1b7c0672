ERROR:WEAK_DECLARATION: Using weak declarations can have unintended link defects
#311: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:326:
+extern struct clocksource * __init __weak clocksource_default_clock(void);

Using weak declarations like __attribute__((weak)) or __weak
can have unintended link defects.  Avoid using them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#311: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:326:
+extern struct clocksource * __init __weak clocksource_default_clock(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
