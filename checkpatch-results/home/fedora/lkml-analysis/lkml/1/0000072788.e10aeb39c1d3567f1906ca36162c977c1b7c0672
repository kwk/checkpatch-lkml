WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#77: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#82: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/opencores-kbd.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!addr_res"
#133: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/opencores-kbd.c:52:
+	if (addr_res == NULL || irq_res == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#142: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/opencores-kbd.c:61:
+	opencores_kbd->keycode = kmalloc(NUM_KEYS * sizeof(unsigned short), GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#188: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/opencores-kbd.c:107:
+	error = request_irq(irq_res->start, &opencores_kbd_isr, IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING, pdev->name, pdev);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
