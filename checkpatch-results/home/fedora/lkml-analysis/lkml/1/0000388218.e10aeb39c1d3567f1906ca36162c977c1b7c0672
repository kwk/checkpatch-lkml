WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#154: FILE: drivers/s390/char/vmur.c:286:
+	BUG_ON(!urd);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ur_set_online', this function's name, in a string
#275: FILE: drivers/s390/char/vmur.c:838:
+	TRACE("ur_set_online: cdev=%p\n", cdev);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ur_remove', this function's name, in a string
#378: FILE: drivers/s390/char/vmur.c:948:
+	TRACE("ur_remove\n");
