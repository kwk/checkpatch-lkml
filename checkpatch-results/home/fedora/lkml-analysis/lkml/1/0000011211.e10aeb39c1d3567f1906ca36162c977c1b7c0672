CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#135: FILE: drivers/hwmon/lis3lv02d.c:328:
 {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#211: FILE: drivers/hwmon/lis3lv02d.c:606:
+			struct input_dev *input_dev = lis3_dev.idev->input;
+			input_set_capability(input_dev, EV_KEY, BTN_X);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
