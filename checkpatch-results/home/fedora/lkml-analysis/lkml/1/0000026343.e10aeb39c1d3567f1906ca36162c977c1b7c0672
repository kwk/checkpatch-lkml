WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct wacom_features should normally be const
#45: FILE: drivers/input/tablet/wacom_sys.c:668:
+static struct wacom_features wacom_features[] = {};

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
