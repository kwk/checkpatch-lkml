Subject: [PATCH 28/33] score: create lib/ files Makefile libgcc.h cmpdi2.c ucmpdi2.c string.S

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#49: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#68: FILE: arch/score/lib/cmpdi2.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#69: FILE: arch/score/lib/cmpdi2.c:2:
+ * arch/score/lib/cmpdi2.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#84: FILE: arch/score/lib/cmpdi2.c:17:
+ * 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <DWunion>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
