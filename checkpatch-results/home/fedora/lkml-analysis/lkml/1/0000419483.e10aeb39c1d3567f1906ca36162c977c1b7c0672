ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#47: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c:243:
+static int noinline __init_refok find_num_cache_leaves(void)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

 }
+static void __cpuexit cache_remove_shared_cpu_map(unsigned int cpu, int index)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __cpuinitdata should be placed after thermal_throttle_cpu_notifier
#76: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mcheck/therm_throt.c:153:
+static __cpuinitdata struct notifier_block thermal_throttle_cpu_notifier =

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
