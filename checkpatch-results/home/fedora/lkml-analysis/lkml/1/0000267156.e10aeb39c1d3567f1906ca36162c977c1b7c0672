#34: 
Technologic Systems TS-7800 which also includes a HW RNG generator; 32 bits 

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#140: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/Kconfig:23:
+config HW_RANDOM_TIMERIOMEM
+	tristate "Timer IOMEM HW Random Number Generator support"
+	depends on HW_RANDOM
+	---help---
+	  This driver provides kernel-side support for a generic Random
+	  Number Generator provisioned by hardware through a dumb iomem
+	  address; for example the TS-7800 is such a device.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called timeriomem-rng.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
