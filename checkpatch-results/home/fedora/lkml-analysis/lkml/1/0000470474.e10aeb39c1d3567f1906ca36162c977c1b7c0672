#40: 
This time instead of generating the generating the paths from proc_dir_entries

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#68: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1433:
+	buffer = (char*)__get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
