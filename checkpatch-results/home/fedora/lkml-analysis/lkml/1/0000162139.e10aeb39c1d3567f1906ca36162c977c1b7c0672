CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: include/linux/uaccess.h:109:
+extern int copy_strtok_from_user(void *to, const void __user *from,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#67: FILE: lib/uaccess.c:2:
+ * lib/uaccess.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'read'
#123: FILE: lib/uaccess.c:101:
+ *  len -= ret;  - 4 bytes was read
+ *  read = ret;

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'read'
#133: FILE: lib/uaccess.c:111:
+ *  len -= ret; - 5 bytes read
+ *  read += ret;

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#212: FILE: lib/uaccess.c:190:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#216: FILE: lib/uaccess.c:194:
+	       have_copied < copy && !memchr(delim, ch, len)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#237: FILE: lib/uaccess.c:215:
+	if (memchr(delim, ch, len))
[...]
+	else if (have_copied == copy)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
