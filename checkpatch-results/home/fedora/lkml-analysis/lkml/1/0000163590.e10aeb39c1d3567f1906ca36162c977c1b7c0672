WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#37: 
# echo -1 > /sys/module/firedtv/parameters/debug

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
