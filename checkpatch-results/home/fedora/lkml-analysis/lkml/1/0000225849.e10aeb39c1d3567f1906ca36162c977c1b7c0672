CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: include/linux/iommu-helper.h:14:
+extern void iommu_area_reserve(unsigned long *map, unsigned long i, int len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
