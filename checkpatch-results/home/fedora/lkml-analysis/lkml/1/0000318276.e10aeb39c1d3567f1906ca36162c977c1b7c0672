CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#266: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup64.c:143:
+	for_each_possible_cpu(i) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#364: FILE: include/asm-x86/pda.h:41:
+extern void x86_64_cleanup_pda(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
