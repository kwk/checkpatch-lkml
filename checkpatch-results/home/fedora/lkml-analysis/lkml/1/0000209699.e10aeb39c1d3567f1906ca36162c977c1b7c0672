WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#112: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/e820.c:1321:
+			insert_resource_expand_to_fit(&iomem_resource, res->start, res->end, res->name);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
