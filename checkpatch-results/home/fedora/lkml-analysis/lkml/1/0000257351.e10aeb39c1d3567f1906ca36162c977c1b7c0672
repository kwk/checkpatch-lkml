CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#53: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:32:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#119: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgtable.h:304:
+extern void native_pagetable_setup_start(pgd_t *base);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
