WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dma_irq_handler', this function's name, in a string
#54: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_bfin5xx.c:566:
+		"in dma_irq_handler dmastat:0x%x spistat:0x%x\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
