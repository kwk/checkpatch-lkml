CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#45: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/crash.c:74:
+	buf = (u64 *) CPU_PTR(crash_notes, cpu);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#71: FILE: kernel/kexec.c:1125:
+	buf = (u32*)CPU_PTR(crash_notes, cpu);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
