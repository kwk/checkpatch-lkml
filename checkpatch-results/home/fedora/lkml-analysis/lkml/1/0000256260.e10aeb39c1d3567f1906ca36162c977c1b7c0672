Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#203: FILE: kernel/irq/spurious.c:95:
+ ^Ifor (i = 1; i < NR_IRQS; i++) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#219: FILE: kernel/irq/spurious.c:111:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
