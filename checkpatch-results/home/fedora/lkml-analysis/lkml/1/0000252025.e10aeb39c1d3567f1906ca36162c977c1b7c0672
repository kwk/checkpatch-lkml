WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#102: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig.debug:8:
+config STRICT_DEVMEM
+	bool "Filter access to /dev/mem"
 	help
 	  If this option is left on, you allow userspace (root) access to all
 	  of memory, including kernel and userspace memory. Accidental
 	  access to this is obviously disastrous, but specific access can
+	  be used by people debugging the kernel. Note that with PAT support
+	  be used by people debugging the kernel. Note that with PAT support
+	  enabled, even in this case there are restrictions on /dev/mem
+	  use due to the cache aliasing requirements.
 
 	  If this option is switched on, the /dev/mem file only allows
 	  userspace access to PCI space and the BIOS code and data regions.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
