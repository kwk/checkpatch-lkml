WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#21: 
Subject: [PATCH 3/5] x86: PAT: fixed checkpatch errors (and whitespaces)

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#64: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pat.c:69:
+#define PAT(x, y)	((u64)PAT_ ## y << ((x)*8))
                  	                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
