Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#104: FILE: fs/eventfd.c:229:
+	struct eventfd_ctx *ctx = (struct eventfd_ctx *) ref;

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#147: FILE: include/linux/eventfd.h:43:
+{ return ERR_PTR(-ENOSYS); }

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
