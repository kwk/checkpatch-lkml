WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#120: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:101:
+		umode_t mode = iattr->ia_mode;
+		iattrs->ia_mode = sd->s_mode = mode;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#120: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:101:
+		iattrs->ia_mode = sd->s_mode = mode;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
