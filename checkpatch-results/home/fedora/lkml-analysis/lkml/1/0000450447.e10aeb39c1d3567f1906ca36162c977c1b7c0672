CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#68: FILE: drivers/parisc/ccio-dma.c:671:
+	saved_byte_cnt = byte_cnt = ALIGN(byte_cnt, IOVP_SIZE);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
