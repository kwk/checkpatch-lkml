WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#89: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:284:
+		BUG_ON(host->next_slot != NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "host->next_slot"
#89: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:284:
+		BUG_ON(host->next_slot != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#117: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:429:
+	tick_ns = (1000000000 + slot->fclk_freq - 1)/slot->fclk_freq;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
