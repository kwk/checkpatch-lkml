The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#50: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:15:
+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#83: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:48:
+struct mtd_dev_param
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#90: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:55:
+static int mtd_devs = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#214: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:179:
+		mtd_num = simple_strtoul(mtd_dev, &endp, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#241: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:206:
+	ubi = ubis[ubi_num] = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ubi_info), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ubis[ubi_num])...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ubi_info)...)
#241: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:206:
+	ubi = ubis[ubi_num] = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ubi_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
