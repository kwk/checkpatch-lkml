ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#72: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-gru/grufault.c:773:
+ ^I^I/* Register the current task as the GSEG owner */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#161: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-gru/grutables.h:652:
+extern int gru_set_context_option(unsigned long address);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
