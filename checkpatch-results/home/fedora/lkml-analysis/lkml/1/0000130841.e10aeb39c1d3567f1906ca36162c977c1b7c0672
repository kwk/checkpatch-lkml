      ocfs2: Add missing iput() during error handling in ocfs2_dentry_attach_lock()
                         ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#99: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dcache.c:294:
+	 * In case of error, manually free the allocation and do the iput().
 	                                                             ^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#101: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dcache.c:296:
+	 * which means iput() will not be called during dput(dentry).
 	               ^^^^

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#105: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dcache.c:300:
+		BUG_ON(dl->dl_count != 1);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#183: FILE: fs/ocfs2/journal.h:441:
+ * orphan dir index leaf */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
