The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#341: FILE: arch/x86/xen/irq.c:116:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of const init definition must use __initconst
#352: FILE: arch/x86/xen/irq.c:127:
+static const struct pv_irq_ops xen_irq_ops __initdata = {

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - void __init xen_init_irq_ops() should probably be void __init xen_init_irq_ops(void)
#365: FILE: arch/x86/xen/irq.c:140:
+void __init xen_init_irq_ops()

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)
