Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#68: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:24:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#141: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:129:
+	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&module_unload_inhibit_cnt) < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#181: FILE: fs/sysfs/sysfs.h:156:
+extern int sysfs_module_callback(struct notifier_block *self, unsigned long val,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
