ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#156: FILE: include/linux/mroute.h:251:
+struct pimreghdr
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#163: FILE: include/linux/mroute.h:258:
+extern int pim_rcv_v1(struct sk_buff *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct sk_buff *' should also have an identifier name
#163: FILE: include/linux/mroute.h:258:
+extern int pim_rcv_v1(struct sk_buff *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.
