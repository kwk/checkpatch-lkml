#38: 
Fixes cpufreq_ondemand going nuts here on an AMD64 UP running 2.6.20-rc6-rt2.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#52: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:268:
+extern void __update_process_times(int user_tick, unsigned long ticks);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#167: FILE: kernel/time/tick-sched.c:357:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
