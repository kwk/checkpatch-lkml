#37: 
     I get the following errors when I choose devices in /sys/power/pm_test. It also shows that if 'dpm_suspend_start' fails somewhere down the line then the kernel does not reset the 'transition_started' variable and we can get warning similar to below. IMHO 'dpm_resume_noirq' is not the right place for setting this variable. Please see the patch below which fixes the issue.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.
