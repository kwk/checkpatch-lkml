CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'event != BUS_NOTIFY_ADD_DEVICE'
#272: FILE: drivers/net/fec_mpc52xx.c:838:
+	if ((event != BUS_NOTIFY_ADD_DEVICE) ||
+	    (dev_archdata_get_node(&dev->archdata) != priv->phy_node))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'prop_size >= sizeof(phandle)'

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#369: FILE: drivers/net/fec_mpc52xx.c:998:
+			dev_err(&op->dev, "warning: 'fsl,7-wire-mode' is"
+				" illegal when 'phy-handle' is present\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#399: FILE: drivers/net/fec_mpc52xx.c:1008:
+	 * to wait for a phy_device first. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
