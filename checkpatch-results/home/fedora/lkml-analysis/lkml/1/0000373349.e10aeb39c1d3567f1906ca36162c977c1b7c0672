#33: 
Mark iget() and read_inode() as being obsolete and remove references to them

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#183: FILE: fs/inode.c:1437:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#201: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1184:
+	void (*read_inode) (struct inode *) __deprecated;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#221: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1621:
+extern struct inode *iget(struct super_block *sb, unsigned long ino)

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
