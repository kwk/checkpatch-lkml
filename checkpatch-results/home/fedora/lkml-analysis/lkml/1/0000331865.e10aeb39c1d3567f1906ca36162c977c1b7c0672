WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#44: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#49: FILE: samples/kobject/kset-example.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#90: FILE: samples/kobject/kset-example.c:42:
+	ssize_t (*store)(struct foo_obj *foo, struct foo_attribute *attr, const char *buf, size_t count);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#138: FILE: samples/kobject/kset-example.c:90:
+static struct sysfs_ops foo_sysfs_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
