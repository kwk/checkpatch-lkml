CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#93: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c:279:
+	if (!fake_panic) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_emerg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_emerg(dev, ... then pr_emerg(...  to printk(KERN_EMERG ...

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#127: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c:1707:
+	u64 new;
+	if (strict_strtoull(buf, 0, &new) < 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoull is obsolete, use kstrtoull instead
#127: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c:1707:
+	if (strict_strtoull(buf, 0, &new) < 0)

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
