Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#100: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:289:
+extern int is_vmalloc_or_module_addr(const void *x);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
