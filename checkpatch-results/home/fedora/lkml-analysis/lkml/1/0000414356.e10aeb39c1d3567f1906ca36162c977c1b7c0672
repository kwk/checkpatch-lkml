The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#108: FILE: kernel/sched_idletask.c:36:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#110: FILE: kernel/sched_idletask.c:37:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
