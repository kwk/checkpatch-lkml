Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*chip)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct max17040_chip)...)

+	chip = kzalloc(sizeof(struct max17040_chip), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
