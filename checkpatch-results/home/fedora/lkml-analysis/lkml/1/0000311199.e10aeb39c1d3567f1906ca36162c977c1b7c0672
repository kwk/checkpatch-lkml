#71: 
      [S390] dasd: fix reference counting in display method for proc/dasd/devices

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#218: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/ipl.c:707:
+	disabled_wait((unsigned long) __builtin_return_address(0));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#297: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_proc.c:65:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
