ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#87: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:1926:
+	if (event->attr.threshold)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#90: FILE: kernel/perf_event.c:1929:
+		u64 count = atomic64_read(&event->count);
+		if (count < event->attr.min_threshold)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
