+static int hisax_cs_setup_card(struct IsdnCard *card)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*cs)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct IsdnCardState)...)
#163: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/config.c:1025:
+	cs = kzalloc(sizeof(struct IsdnCardState), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
