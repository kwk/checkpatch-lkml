WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#99: 
#define EXT4_DIR_LINK_MAX(dir) (!is_dx(dir) && (dir)->i_nlink >= EXT4_LINK_MAX)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#157: FILE: fs/ext4/namei.c:1632:
+			EXT4_SET_RO_COMPAT_FEATURE(inode->i_sb,
+					      EXT4_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_DIR_NLINK);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#173: FILE: fs/ext4/namei.c:1648:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#281: FILE: fs/ext4/namei.c:2370:
+			 * ext3_dec_count() won't work for many-linked dirs */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
