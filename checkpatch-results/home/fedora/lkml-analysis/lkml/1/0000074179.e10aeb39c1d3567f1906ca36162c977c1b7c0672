WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'explaning' may be misspelled - perhaps 'explaining'?
#29: 
a message is printed explaning what went wrong and how to fix it.
                     ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#64: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:1465:
+	struct gfs2_sbd *sdp = rgd->rd_sbd;
+	fs_warn(sdp, "rgrp %llu has an error, marking it readonly until umount\n",

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#65: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:1466:
+^I        (unsigned long long)rgd->rd_addr);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#142: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.h:50:
+extern int gfs2_alloc_di(struct gfs2_inode *ip, u64 *bn, u64 *generation);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
