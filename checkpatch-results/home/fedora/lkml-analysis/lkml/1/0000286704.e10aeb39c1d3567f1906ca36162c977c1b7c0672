ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#71: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_policy.c:157:
+static void xfrm_policy_worker(struct work_struct *w)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
