Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#116: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1151:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#130: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1165:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#133: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1168:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
