This patch creates an asynchronous initlevel (6a) which is at the same level as

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#90: FILE: include/linux/init.h:254:
+#define module_init_async(x)	__initcall_async(x);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#116: FILE: init/main.c:741:
+extern initcall_t __async_initcall_start[], __async_initcall_end[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#131: FILE: init/main.c:753:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
