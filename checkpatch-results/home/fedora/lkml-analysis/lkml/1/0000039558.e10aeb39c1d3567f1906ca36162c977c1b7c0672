WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#75: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#80: FILE: arch/arm/plat-mxc/tzic.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Indentification' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Identification'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'disble' may be misspelled - perhaps 'disable'?

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#212: FILE: arch/arm/plat-mxc/tzic.c:133:
+	for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
+		__raw_writel(0xFFFFFFFF, tzic_base + TZIC_INTSEC0 + i * 4);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
