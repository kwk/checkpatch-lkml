+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a

However this is not always the case (See signal.h).

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
