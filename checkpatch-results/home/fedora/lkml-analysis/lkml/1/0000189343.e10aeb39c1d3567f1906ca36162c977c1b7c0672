CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: include/linux/fault-inject.h:85:
+extern bool should_failslab(size_t size, gfp_t gfpflags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#167: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#172: FILE: mm/failslab.c:1:
+#include <linux/fault-inject.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#190: FILE: mm/failslab.c:19:
+        if (failslab.ignore_gfp_wait && (gfpflags & __GFP_WAIT))$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#190: FILE: mm/failslab.c:19:
+        if (failslab.ignore_gfp_wait && (gfpflags & __GFP_WAIT))$

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#200: FILE: mm/failslab.c:29:
+__setup("failslab=", setup_failslab);

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0600'.
#206: FILE: mm/failslab.c:35:
+	mode_t mode = S_IFREG | S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR;

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#217: FILE: mm/failslab.c:46:
+		debugfs_create_bool("ignore-gfp-wait", mode, dir,
+				      &failslab.ignore_gfp_wait);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#258: FILE: mm/slab.c:3002:
+		BUG_ON(slabp->inuse >= cachep->num);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
