CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#69: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:263:
+#define TAINT_CRAP			(1<<10)
                   			  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#69: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:263:
+#define TAINT_CRAP			(1<<10)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#92: FILE: kernel/module.c:1967:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: module is from the staging directory,"

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#93: FILE: kernel/module.c:1968:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: module is from the staging directory,"
+		       " the quality is unknown, you have been warned.\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
