ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#149: FILE: sched.c:3145:
+^Istruct task_struct *p = NULL; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open brace '{'
#169: FILE: sched.c:3165:
+	} else if (!found_noninteractive && array == rq->active){

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#186: FILE: sched.c:3182:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:IF_0: Consider removing the code enclosed by this #if 0 and its #endif

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "p"
#201: FILE: sched.c:3197:
+	return p != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
