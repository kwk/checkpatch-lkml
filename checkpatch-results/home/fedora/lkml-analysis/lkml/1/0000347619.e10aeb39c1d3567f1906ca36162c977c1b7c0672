Subject: [Patch 2/8] Enhanced partition statistics: update partition statitics
                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#26: 
Updates the enhanced partition statistics in generic block layer besides the disk statistics.

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#81: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:2927:
+		struct hd_struct *part
+			= get_part(req->rq_disk, req->sector);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#165: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:362:
+extern void part_round_stats(struct hd_struct *part);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
