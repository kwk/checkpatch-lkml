The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#81: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap1/board-palmtt.c:2:
+ * linux/arch/arm/mach-omap1/board-palmtt.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after palmtt_boardinfo[]
#362: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap1/board-palmtt.c:283:
+static struct spi_board_info __initdata palmtt_boardinfo[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1377655732.3619.19.camel@joe-AO722/

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#401: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap1/board-palmtt.c:322:
+static void __init omap_mpu_wdt_mode(int mode) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#402: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap1/board-palmtt.c:323:
+	if (mode)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
