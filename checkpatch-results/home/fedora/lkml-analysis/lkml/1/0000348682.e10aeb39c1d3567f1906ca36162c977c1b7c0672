CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#101: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:595:
+extern int uids_sysfs_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:NAKED_SSCANF: unchecked sscanf return value

WARNING:SSCANF_TO_KSTRTO: Prefer kstrto<type> to single variable sscanf

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#213: FILE: kernel/user.c:175:
+static struct sysfs_ops uids_attributes_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
