CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*vc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct vc_data)...)
#45: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:732:
+	    vc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct vc_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
