CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#56: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:286:
+extern bool pm_transition_in_progress(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#84: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1627:
+		if (order > PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER
+		    || pm_transition_in_progress()) {

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Out>
#101: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:306:
+		goto Out;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
