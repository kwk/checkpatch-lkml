CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: fs/gfs2/inode.h:109:
+extern void gfs2_set_inode_flags(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#100: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#292: FILE: fs/gfs2/super.h:55:
+extern struct dentry_operations gfs2_dops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
