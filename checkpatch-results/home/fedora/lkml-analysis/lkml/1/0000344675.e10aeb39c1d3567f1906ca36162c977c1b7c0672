CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*airq)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct airq_t)...)

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead
#230: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/airq.c:104:
+	synchronize_sched();

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#433: FILE: include/asm-s390/airq.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#434: FILE: include/asm-s390/airq.h:2:
+ *  include/asm-s390/airq.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'adapter_int_handler_t' should also have an identifier name
#448: FILE: include/asm-s390/airq.h:16:
+void *s390_register_adapter_interrupt(adapter_int_handler_t, void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#448: FILE: include/asm-s390/airq.h:16:
