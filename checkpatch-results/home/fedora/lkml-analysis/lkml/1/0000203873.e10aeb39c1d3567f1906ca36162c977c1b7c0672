CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#59: FILE: drivers/dma/dmatest.c:39:
+MODULE_PARM_DESC(max_channels,
 		"Maximum number of channels to use (default: all)");

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#179: FILE: drivers/dma/dmatest.c:383:
+		if (chan) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#184: FILE: drivers/dma/dmatest.c:388:
+		} else

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#193: FILE: drivers/dma/dmatest.c:396:
 }
+/* when compiled-in wait for drivers to load first */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
