CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#283: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:257:
+extern void account_process_tick(struct task_struct *task, int user);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#309: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1472:
+int sched_nr_latency_handler(struct ctl_table *table, int write,
+		struct file *file, void __user *buffer, size_t *length,

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#343: FILE: include/linux/smp.h:91:
 }
+#define smp_call_function(func, info, retry, wait) \

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
