Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_VARIABLE: Use of EXTRA_CFLAGS is deprecated, please use `ccflags-y instead.
#80: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlmfs/Makefile:1:
+EXTRA_CFLAGS += -Ifs/ocfs2

EXTRA_{A,C,CPP,LD}FLAGS are deprecated and should be replaced by the new
flags added via commit f77bf01425b1 ("kbuild: introduce ccflags-y,
asflags-y and ldflags-y").

The following conversion scheme maybe used::

  EXTRA_AFLAGS    ->  asflags-y
  EXTRA_CFLAGS    ->  ccflags-y
  EXTRA_CPPFLAGS  ->  cppflags-y
  EXTRA_LDFLAGS   ->  ldflags-y
