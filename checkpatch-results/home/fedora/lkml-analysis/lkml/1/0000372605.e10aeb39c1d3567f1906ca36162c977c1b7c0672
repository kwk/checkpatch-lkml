Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#48: FILE: kernel/sched.c:560:
+		struct rq *rq = task_rq(p);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
