This reverts commit c9530948bc626c8b638015c0b32abb9615659ec6.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "strstr"
#160: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/early_printk.c:191:
+	keep_early = (strstr(buf, "keep") != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#162: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/early_printk.c:193:
+	if (!strncmp(buf, "serial", 6)) {
[...]
+	} else if (!strncmp(buf, "ttyS", 4)) {
[...]
+	} else if (!strncmp(buf, "vga", 3)
[...]
-		if (!strncmp(buf, "dbgp", 4) && !early_dbgp_init(buf + 4))
[...]
-		buf++;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#169: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/early_printk.c:200:
+	} else if (!strncmp(buf, "vga", 3)
+		&& boot_params.screen_info.orig_video_isVGA == 1) {

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <orig_video_isVGA>
#169: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/early_printk.c:200:
+		&& boot_params.screen_info.orig_video_isVGA == 1) {

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#178: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/early_printk.c:207:
+		if (early_dbgp_init(buf+4) < 0)
 		                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
