CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#99: FILE: mm/hwpoison-inject.c:48:

 					  NULL, &hwpoison_fops);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#127: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1324:
+extern int unpoison_memory(unsigned long pfn);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <HWPoison>
#223: FILE: include/linux/page-flags.h:280:
+TESTSCFLAG(HWPoison, hwpoison)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
