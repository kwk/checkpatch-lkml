Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'occurences' may be misspelled - perhaps 'occurrences'?
#26: 
Some misspelled occurences of 'octet' and some comments were also fixed
                ^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'exceded' may be misspelled - perhaps 'exceeded'?
#121: FILE: drivers/net/ppp_generic.c:1439:
+		 * check if we are on the last channel or we exceded the length
 		                                             ^^^^^^^

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around ctx->pointer
#334: FILE: fs/cifs/asn1.c:139:
+	ch = *(ctx->pointer)++; /* ch has 0xa, ptr points to length octet */

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

 		printk(KERN_WARNING "UDF-fs (%s): Inode %lu (mode %o) has "
+			"inode size %llu different from extent length %llu. "
