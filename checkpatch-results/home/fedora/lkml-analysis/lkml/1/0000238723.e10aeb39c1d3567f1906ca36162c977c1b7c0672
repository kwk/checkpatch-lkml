WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns
#268: FILE: drivers/video/vt8623fb.c:717:
+		dev_err(info->device, "memory size detection failed (%x %x), suppose 16 MB\n", memsize1, memsize2);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
