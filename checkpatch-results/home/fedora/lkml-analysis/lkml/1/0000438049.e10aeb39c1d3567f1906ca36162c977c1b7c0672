CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#64: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:24:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#106: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:165:
+					ilog2(THREAD_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE));
 					                 ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#128: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:186:
+	irqctx = (union irq_ctx*)per_cpu(hardirq_stack, cpu);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
