Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mask_str"
#178: FILE: kernel/sched_stats.h:15:
+	if (mask_str == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
