Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'sytle' may be misspelled - perhaps 'style'?

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#115: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:474:
+static int cramfs_get_block(struct inode *inode, sector_t iblock,

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#118: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:477:
+	BUG_ON(unlikely(create));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
