WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#50: FILE: arch/s390/Kconfig:433:
+config PAGE_STATES
+	bool "Unused page notification"
+	help
+	  This enables the notification of unused pages to the
+	  hypervisor. The ESSA instruction is used to do the states
+	  changes between a page that has content and the unused state.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#88: FILE: arch/s390/mm/page-states.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#89: FILE: arch/s390/mm/page-states.c:2:
+ * arch/s390/mm/page-states.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'parm' may be misspelled - perhaps 'param'?
#111: FILE: arch/s390/mm/page-states.c:24:
+	char *parm;
 	      ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'parm' may be misspelled - perhaps 'param'?
#112: FILE: arch/s390/mm/page-states.c:25:
+	parm = strstrip(str);
 	^^^^

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#112: FILE: arch/s390/mm/page-states.c:25:
+	char *parm;
+	parm = strstrip(str);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#128: FILE: arch/s390/mm/page-states.c:41:
+	register int rc asm("1") = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#198: FILE: include/asm-s390/system.h:120:
+extern void cmma_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
