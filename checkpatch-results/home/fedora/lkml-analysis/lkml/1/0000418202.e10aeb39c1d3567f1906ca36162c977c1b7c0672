ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#77: 
--- a/kernel/x86_emulate.c	2007-06-03 10:31:15.000000000 +0200

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dst.orig_val != dst.val'
#100: FILE: kernel/x86_emulate.c:1061:
+	if ((d & Mov) || (dst.orig_val != dst.val) || isxchg) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

#100: FILE: kernel/x86_emulate.c:1061:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
