WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#93: FILE: arch/arm/include/asm/unistd.h:394:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <__NR_Linux>
#255: FILE: arch/mips/include/asm/unistd.h:358:
+#define __NR_sched_wait_block (__NR_Linux + 335)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <__NR_Linux_syscalls>
#260: FILE: arch/mips/include/asm/unistd.h:362:
+#define __NR_Linux_syscalls		335

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#472: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1283:
+  unsigned in_taskwait:1;$

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#529: FILE: kernel/sched.c:5443:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#537: FILE: kernel/sched.c:5454:
+	if (prev->state && !unlikely(prev->in_taskwait) && unlikely(waitqueue_active(&prev->task_waiters)))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:WAITQUEUE_ACTIVE: waitqueue_active without comment
#537: FILE: kernel/sched.c:5454:
+	if (prev->state && !unlikely(prev->in_taskwait) && unlikely(waitqueue_active(&prev->task_waiters)))

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#547: FILE: kernel/sched.c:5473:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#558: FILE: kernel/sched.c:5724:
+	/*if (unlikely(!nr_exclusive))
+		wake_flags = 0;*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#558: FILE: kernel/sched.c:5724:
+		wake_flags = 0;*/

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#568: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6897:
+  struct task_struct* p;$

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#568: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6897:
+  struct task_struct* p;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#573: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6902:
+	if (pid < 0)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
