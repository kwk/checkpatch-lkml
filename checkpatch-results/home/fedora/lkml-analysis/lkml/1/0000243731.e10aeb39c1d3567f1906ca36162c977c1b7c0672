CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#119: FILE: include/linux/list.h:218:
+static inline void __list_cut_position(struct list_head *list,

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#122: FILE: include/linux/list.h:221:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
