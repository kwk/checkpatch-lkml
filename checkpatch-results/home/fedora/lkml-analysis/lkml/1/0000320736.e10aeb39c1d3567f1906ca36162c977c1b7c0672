WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#17: 
Subject: [PATCH] befs: fix sparse warning in linuxvfs.c

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#57: FILE: fs/befs/linuxvfs.c:492:
+		char *link = nd_get_link(nd);
 		                         ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#58: FILE: fs/befs/linuxvfs.c:493:
+		char *link = nd_get_link(nd);
+		if (!IS_ERR(link))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
