WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'additon' may be misspelled - perhaps 'addition'?
#28: 
In additon, the at24 EEPROM driver is updated to use this interface.
   ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct memory_accessor *' should also have an identifier name
#155: FILE: include/linux/i2c/at24.h:28:
+	int             (*setup)(struct memory_accessor *, void *context);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
