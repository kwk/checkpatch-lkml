CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#116: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:464:
+extern int tty_ldisc_release(struct tty_struct *tty, struct tty_struct *o_tty);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
