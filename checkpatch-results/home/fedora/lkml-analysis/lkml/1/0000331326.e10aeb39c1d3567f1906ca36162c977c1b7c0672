WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#49: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#54: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/heartbeat.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#55: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/heartbeat.c:2:
+ * arch/microblaze/kernel/heartbeat.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#66: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/heartbeat.c:13:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:IF_0: Consider removing the code enclosed by this #if 0 and its #endif
#71: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/heartbeat.c:18:
+#if 0

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#74: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/heartbeat.c:21:
+	if (cnt == 0 || cnt == dist) {
[...]
+	} else if (cnt == 7 || cnt == dist + 7) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
