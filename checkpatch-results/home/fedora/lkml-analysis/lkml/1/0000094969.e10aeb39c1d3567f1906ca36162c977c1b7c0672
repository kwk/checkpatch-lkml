ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#61: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:253:
static_protections(pgprot_t prot, unsigned long address,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/cacheflush.h> instead of <asm/cacheflush.h>
#83: FILE: arch/x86/pci/pcbios.c:11:
+#include <asm/cacheflush.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
