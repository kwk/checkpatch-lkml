#29: 
current event.  But it does 2 things wrong.  First it is comparing old->inode

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'postive' may be misspelled - perhaps 'positive'?
#36: 
negative dentry for the removed object rather than the postive dentry from
                                                       ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#66: FILE: fs/notify/notification.c:145:
+			 * left to check was if the file_name is the same */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
