WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#14: 
Subject: [PATCH 02/43] drivers/net/e2100.c: fix sparse warning: symbol shadows

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#53: FILE: drivers/net/e2100.c:220:
+		int irqlist[] = {15, 11, 10, 12, 5, 9, 3, 4};
+		for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(irqlist); i++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
