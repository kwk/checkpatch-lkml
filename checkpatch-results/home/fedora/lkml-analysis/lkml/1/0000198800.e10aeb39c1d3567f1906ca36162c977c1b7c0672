Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

+			"exclusive-writable\n", name, (void*) seg->start_addr,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
