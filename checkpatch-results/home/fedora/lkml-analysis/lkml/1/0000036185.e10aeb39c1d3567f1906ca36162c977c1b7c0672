CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#73: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1186:
+				bh = head = page_buffers(page);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
