Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct hrtimer *' should also have an identifier name
#73: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:524:
+	enum hrtimer_restart	(*function)(struct hrtimer *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'funtion' may be misspelled - perhaps 'function'?
#157: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:538:
+ * @function:	 hrtimer callback funtion which gets called from softirq context
              	                  ^^^^^^^
