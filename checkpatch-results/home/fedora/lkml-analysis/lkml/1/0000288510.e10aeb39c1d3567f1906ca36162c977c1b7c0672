Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!port"
#360: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:341:
+	if (port == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#385: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:359:
 		printk(KERN_WARNING "rc%d: port %d: Receiver timeout. "
+				    "Hardware problems ?\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#843: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:795:
+		unsigned long tmp = get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL);
+		if (tmp == 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#853: FILE: drivers/char/riscom8.c:800:
