ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#122: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:70:
+unsigned int sysctl_sched_yield_bug_workaround __read_mostly = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#124: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:72:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(sysctl_sched_yield_bug_workaround);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#145: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:852:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
