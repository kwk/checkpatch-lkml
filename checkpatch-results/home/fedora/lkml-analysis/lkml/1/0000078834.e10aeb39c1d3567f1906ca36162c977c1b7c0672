CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#138: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.c:234:
+	if (path) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#170: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.h:15:
+extern struct tracepoint_path *tracepoint_id_to_path(u64 config);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#179: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.h:33:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
