To rule out any e1000 problem, can you try the the following please,

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#68: FILE: drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c:3877:
+		static unsigned int been_here = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_notice([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_notice(dev, ... then pr_notice(...  to printk(KERN_NOTICE ...
#72: FILE: drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c:3881:
+			printk(KERN_NOTICE "e1000_intr and rx_sched set (%u); state=0x%lx\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'e1000_intr', this function's name, in a string
#72: FILE: drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c:3881:
+			printk(KERN_NOTICE "e1000_intr and rx_sched set (%u); state=0x%lx\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#73: FILE: drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c:3882:
+			printk(KERN_NOTICE "e1000_intr and rx_sched set (%u); state=0x%lx\n",
+					been_here, netdev->state);
