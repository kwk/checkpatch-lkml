CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#371: FILE: lib/sort.c:154:
+		p = oldhead = list;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
