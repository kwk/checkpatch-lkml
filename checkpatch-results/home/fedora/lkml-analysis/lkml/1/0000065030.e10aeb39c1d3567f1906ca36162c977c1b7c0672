CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#77: FILE: drivers/usb/host/xhci.h:1062:
+#define	XHCI_LINK_TRB_QUIRK	(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#88: FILE: drivers/usb/host/xhci.h:1144:
+	u32 temp = xhci_readl(xhci, &xhci->cap_regs->hc_capbase);
+	return ((HC_VERSION(temp) == 0x95) &&

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+			(xhci->quirks & XHCI_LINK_TRB_QUIRK));

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#110: FILE: drivers/usb/host/xhci-hcd.c:34:
+module_param(link_quirk, int, S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
