 					printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: "
+					       "rhine_interrupt() Tx engine "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rhine_interrupt', this function's name, in a string
#263: FILE: drivers/net/via-rhine.c:1341:
+					       "rhine_interrupt() Tx engine "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
