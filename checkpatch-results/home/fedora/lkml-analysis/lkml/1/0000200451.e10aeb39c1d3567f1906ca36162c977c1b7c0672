Subject: [PATCH] x86: microcode: fix sparse warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct microcode_ops should normally be const
#60: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode_core.c:102:
+static struct microcode_ops *microcode_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
