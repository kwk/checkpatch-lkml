#33: 
Suppress A.OUT library support in ELF binfmt if CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT is not set.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#134: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/process.c:325:
+aout_dump_thread(struct pt_regs * pt, struct user * dump)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#1340: FILE: include/linux/a.out.h:276:
+extern void aout_dump_thread(struct pt_regs *regs, struct user *dump);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
