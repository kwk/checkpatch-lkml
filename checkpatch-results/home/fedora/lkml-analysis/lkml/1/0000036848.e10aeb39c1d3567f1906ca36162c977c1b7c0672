CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#129: FILE: include/linux/pm.h:514:
+extern int __dpm_wait(struct device *dev, void *ign);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <End>
#341: FILE: drivers/base/power/main.c:752:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
