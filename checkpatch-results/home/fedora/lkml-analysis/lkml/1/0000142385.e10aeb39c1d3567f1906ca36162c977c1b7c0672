Remove uneeded void casts
       ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#38: 
Signed-Off-By: Jack Stone <jwjstone@fastmail.fm>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 135 exceeds 100 columns
#61: FILE: arch/cris/arch-v32/drivers/cryptocop.c:2783:
+		cop->tfrm_op.indata[0].iov_base = page_address(inpages[0]) + ((unsigned long int)(oper.indata + prev_ix) & ~PAGE_MASK);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
