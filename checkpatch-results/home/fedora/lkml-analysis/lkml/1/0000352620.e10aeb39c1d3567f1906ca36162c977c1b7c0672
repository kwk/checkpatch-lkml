WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#87: FILE: drivers/base/class.c:365:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "make_class_name: name=%p kname=%p\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#88: FILE: drivers/base/class.c:366:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "make_class_name: name=%p kname=%p\n",
+						name, kname);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#89: FILE: drivers/base/class.c:367:
+		BUG_ON(1);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
