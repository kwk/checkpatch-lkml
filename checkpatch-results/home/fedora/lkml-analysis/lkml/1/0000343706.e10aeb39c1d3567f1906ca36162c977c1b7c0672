The user is now able to set how many mmu pages will be allocated to the guest.

WARNING:MINMAX: max() should probably be max_t(unsigned int, nr_mmu_pages, KVM_MIN_ALLOC_MMU_PAGES)

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
