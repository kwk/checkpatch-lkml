Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#234: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-pl.c:98:
+	list_for_each_entry(hidinput, &hid->inputs, list) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
