CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: include/asm-generic/hw_breakpoint.h:136:
+extern int modify_kernel_hw_breakpoint(struct hw_breakpoint *old_bp,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#54: FILE: include/asm-generic/hw_breakpoint.h:137:
+extern int modify_kernel_hw_breakpoint(struct hw_breakpoint *old_bp,
+					struct hw_breakpoint *new_bp);

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#67: FILE: kernel/hw_breakpoint.c:366:
+ * modify_kernel_hw_breakpoint - modify characteristics of a previously registered breakpoint request

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#81: FILE: kernel/hw_breakpoint.c:380:
+		new_cpumask = new_bp->cpumask = cpu_possible_mask;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#97: FILE: kernel/hw_breakpoint.c:396:
+		for (i = HBP_NUM-1; i >= hbp_kernel_pos; i--) {
 		                ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
