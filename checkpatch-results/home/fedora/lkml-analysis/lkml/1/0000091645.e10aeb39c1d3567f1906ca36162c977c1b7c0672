CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#69: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_mce_amd.c:143:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#105: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_mce_amd.c:176:
+		pr_emerg(" Transaction type: %s(%s), %s, Cache Level: %s, "
+			 "Participating Processor: %s\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#108: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_mce_amd.c:179:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
