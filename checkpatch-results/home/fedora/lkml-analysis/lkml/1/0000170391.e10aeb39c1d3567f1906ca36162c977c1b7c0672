WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .4
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that ':' (ctx:ExV)
#96: FILE: arch/x86/lib/usercopy_32.c:221:
+		:"=&r" (n), "=&D" (s), "=&a" (res), "=&c" (tmp)
 		^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#172: FILE: drivers/acpi/namespace/nsutils.c:323:
+		while (acpi_ns_valid_root_prefix(*next_external_char)) {
+			next_external_char++;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_DEV_LEVEL: Prefer dev_notice(... to dev_printk(KERN_NOTICE, ...
#388: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_nv.c:2385:
+		dev_printk(KERN_NOTICE, &pdev->dev, "Using SWNCQ mode\n");

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buf"
#589: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco.c:4948:
+		if (buf == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#600: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco.c:4952:

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoull is obsolete, use kstrtoull instead
#1028: FILE: drivers/xen/balloon.c:491:
+	target_bytes = simple_strtoull(buf, &endchar, 0) * 1024;

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#1036: FILE: drivers/xen/balloon.c:501:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#1038: FILE: drivers/xen/balloon.c:503:
+static ssize_t show_target(struct sys_device *dev, struct sysdev_attribute *attr,
+			      char *buf)

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#1062: FILE: drivers/xen/balloon.c:527:
+static SYSDEV_ATTR(target, S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'addr4->sin_addr.s_addr !=
 		     server->addr.sockAddr.sin_addr.s_addr'
#1090: FILE: fs/cifs/connect.c:1379:
+		if (addr->ss_family == AF_INET &&
 		    (addr4->sin_addr.s_addr !=
 		     server->addr.sockAddr.sin_addr.s_addr))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
