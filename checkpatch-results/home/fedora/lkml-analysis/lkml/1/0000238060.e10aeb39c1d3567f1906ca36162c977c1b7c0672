WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#148: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.h:51:
+sector_t ide_floppy_capacity(ide_drive_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#163: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy_proc.c:1:
+#include <linux/kernel.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#170: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy_proc.c:8:
+static int proc_idefloppy_read_capacity(char *page, char **start, off_t off,

#172: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy_proc.c:10:
+	ide_drive_t*drive = (ide_drive_t *)data;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#180: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy_proc.c:18:
+	{ "capacity",	S_IFREG|S_IRUGO, proc_idefloppy_read_capacity,	NULL },

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
