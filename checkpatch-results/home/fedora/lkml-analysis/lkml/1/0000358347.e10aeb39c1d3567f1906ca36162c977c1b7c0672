Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#144: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/cmd64x.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/pci/cmd64x.c		Version 1.51	Nov 8, 2007

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
