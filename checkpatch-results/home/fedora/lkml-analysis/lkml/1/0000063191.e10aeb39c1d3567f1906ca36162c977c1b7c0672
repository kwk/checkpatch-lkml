> So what's the conclusion of the patch? Any ACK/NAK or patch needs updating?

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#83: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/spitz.c:402:
+	/* This is for remote control support. Zaurus supports wired
+	   remote on headphones. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
