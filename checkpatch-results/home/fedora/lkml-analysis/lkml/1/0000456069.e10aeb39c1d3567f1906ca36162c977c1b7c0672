#30: 
Signed-Off-By: Mark Brown <broonie@sirena.org.uk>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#40: FILE: drivers/net/natsemi.c:2173:
+		 * machine falls over so do it first. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
