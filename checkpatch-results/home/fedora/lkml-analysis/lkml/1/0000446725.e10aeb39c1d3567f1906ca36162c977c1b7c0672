CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1404:
+extern void reparent_kthread(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 118 exceeds 100 columns
#69: FILE: kernel/exit.c:258:
+ * reparent_kthread - Reparent the calling kernel thread to the init task of the pid space that the thread belongs to.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
