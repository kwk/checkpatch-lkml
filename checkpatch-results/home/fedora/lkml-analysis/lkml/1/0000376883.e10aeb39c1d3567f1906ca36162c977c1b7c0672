WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#49: FILE: fs/Kconfig:1519:
+menuconfig NETWORK_FILESYSTEMS
+	bool "Network File Systems"
+	default y
 	depends on NET
+	---help---
+	  Say Y here to get to see options for network filesystems and
+	  filesystem-related networking code, such as NFS daemon and
+	  RPCSEC security modules.
+	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.
+
+	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and
+	  disabled; if unsure, say Y here.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
