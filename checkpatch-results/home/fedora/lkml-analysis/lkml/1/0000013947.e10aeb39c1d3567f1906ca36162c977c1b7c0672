Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#269: FILE: fs/fuse/dev.c:1413:
+	BUG_ON(!fc);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#329: FILE: fs/fuse/dev.c:1473:
+		if (parent->pgoff < region->pgoff) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#331: FILE: fs/fuse/dev.c:1475:
+			struct rb_node *next_link = rb_next(parent_link);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#500: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:2050:

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro

The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
