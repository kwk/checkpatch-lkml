ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#91: FILE: drivers/serial/68328serial.c:377:
+	struct m68k_serial * info = dev_id;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!n"
#163: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1563:
+	if (n == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*i)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct irq_info)...)
#164: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1564:
+		i = kzalloc(sizeof(struct irq_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#195: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1610:
+	BUG_ON(n == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#199: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1613:
+	if (list_empty(i->head)) {
[...]
+		hlist_del(&i->node);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
