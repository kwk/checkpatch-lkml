CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#58: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capi.c:1015:
+	if (ret == 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#74: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capi.c:1028:
+	struct capiminor *mp = tty->driver_data;
+	tty->driver_data = NULL;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#79: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capi.c:1032:
+static int capinc_tty_open(struct tty_struct * tty, struct file * file)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
