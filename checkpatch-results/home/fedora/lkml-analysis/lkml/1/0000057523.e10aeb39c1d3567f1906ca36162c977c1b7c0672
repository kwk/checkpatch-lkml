Subject: [PATCH] binfmt_elf: Reordered object list so compat_binfmt_elf optionally comes first.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#65: FILE: fs/Kconfig.binfmt:30:
+config FAVOR_COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF
+	bool "Favor compatibility ELF binaries"
+	depends on COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  Favor "compatibility" ELF binaries. The system will work either way,
+	  but you can save a few cycles per process by choosing the type of
+	  binary you expect to be loading most of the time. This scenario 
+	  makes sense if you have a 64-bit kernel to manage 4+ gigabytes of
+	  physical RAM but want to run mostly 32-bit processes to conserve
+	  that RAM.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
