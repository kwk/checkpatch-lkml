I don't know the right answer here, so I'm opting out of making the change in this patch for lack of a decisive answer.  The apostrophe in OR'ed seems wrong to me, but ORed looks a bit odd too.  If I get a chance to do a bit more research, I'll try to go back to it (and others) later on.

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
