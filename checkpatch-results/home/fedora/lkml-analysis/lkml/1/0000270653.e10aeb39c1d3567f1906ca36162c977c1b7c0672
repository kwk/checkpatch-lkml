Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EXPORTED_WORLD_WRITABLE: Exporting world writable files is usually an error. Consider more restrictive permissions.

+	bt->msg_file = debugfs_create_file("msg", 0222, dir, bt, &blk_msg_fops);

Exporting world writable sysfs/debugfs files is usually a bad thing.
When done arbitrarily they can introduce serious security bugs.
In the past, some of the debugfs vulnerabilities would seemingly allow
any local user to write arbitrary values into device registers - a
situation from which little good can be expected to emerge.
