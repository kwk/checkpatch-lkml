Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#170: FILE: fs/bio.c:1389:
+	if (error == -EOPNOTSUPP && bio_barrier(bio)) {
[...]
+	} else if (error)

 	else if (!test_bit(BIO_UPTODATE, &bio->bi_flags))
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#449: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:793:
+extern void blk_queue_set_noflush(struct block_device *bdev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
