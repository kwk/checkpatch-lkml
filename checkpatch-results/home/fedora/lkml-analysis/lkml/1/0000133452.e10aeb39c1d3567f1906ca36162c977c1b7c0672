CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#203: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c:227:
+	filter = call->filter = kzalloc(sizeof(*filter), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#210: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c:234:
+	filter->preds = kzalloc(MAX_FILTER_PRED * sizeof(pred), GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#317: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c:399:
+		filter->preds = kzalloc(MAX_FILTER_PRED * sizeof(pred),
 					GFP_KERNEL);
