Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph

FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

It is generally desirable that building the same source code with
the same set of tools is reproducible, i.e. the output is always
exactly the same.

The kernel does *not* use the ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros,

non-deterministic builds.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#298: FILE: drivers/edac/amd8111_edac.c:259:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
