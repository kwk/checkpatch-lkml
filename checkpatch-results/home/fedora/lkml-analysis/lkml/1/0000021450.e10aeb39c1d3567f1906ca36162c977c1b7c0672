WARNING:WAITQUEUE_ACTIVE: waitqueue_active without comment
#88: FILE: fs/eventfd.c:165:

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#127: FILE: include/linux/eventfd.h:70:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
