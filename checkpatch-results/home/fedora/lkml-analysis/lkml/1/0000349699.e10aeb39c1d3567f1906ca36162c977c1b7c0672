Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#152: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:415:
+			extern char last_sysfs_file[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_alert([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_alert(dev, ... then pr_alert(...  to printk(KERN_ALERT ...
#154: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:417:

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#155: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:418:

+					last_sysfs_file);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#184: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:286:
