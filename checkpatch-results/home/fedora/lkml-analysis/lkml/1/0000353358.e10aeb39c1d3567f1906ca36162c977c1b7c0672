+extern int dscale_bytes_to_read(unsigned char *address);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+char * locate_obj_key_id_onwire(char * addr)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
