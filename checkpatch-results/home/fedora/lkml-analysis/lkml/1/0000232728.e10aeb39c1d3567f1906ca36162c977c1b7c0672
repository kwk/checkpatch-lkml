expire point, the kernel now has the freedom to fire this timer at this point,

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#79: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:233:
+static inline void hrtimer_set_expires_range_ns(struct hrtimer *timer, ktime_t time, unsigned long delta)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

+static inline s64 hrtimer_get_softexpires_tv64(const struct hrtimer *timer)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#137: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:421:
+extern int schedule_hrtimeout_range(ktime_t *expires, unsigned long delta,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
