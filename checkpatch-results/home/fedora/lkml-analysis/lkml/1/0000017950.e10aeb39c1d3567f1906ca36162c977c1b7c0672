CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#100: FILE: arch/arm/include/asm/ftrace.h:22:
+extern void ftrace_caller_gnu(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#173: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/ftrace.c:27:
+#define GNU_MCOUNT_ADDR	((unsigned long) __gnu_mcount_nc)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#290: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/ftrace.c:110:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
