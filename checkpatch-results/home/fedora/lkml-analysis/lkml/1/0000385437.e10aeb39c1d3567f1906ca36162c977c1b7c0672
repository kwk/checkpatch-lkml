CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#56: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:961:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#67: FILE: arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_binfmt.c:265:
+extern void arch_randomize_brk(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
