WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct machine_desc should normally be const
#71: FILE: arch/arm/mach-msm/board-dream.c:51:
+static void __init dream_fixup(struct machine_desc *desc, struct tag *tags,

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
