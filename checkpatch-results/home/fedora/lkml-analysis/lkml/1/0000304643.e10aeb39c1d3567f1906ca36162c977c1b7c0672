WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#230: FILE: drivers/sh/maple/maple.c:387:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'aquire' may be misspelled - perhaps 'acquire'?
#231: FILE: drivers/sh/maple/maple.c:388:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BOOL_COMPARISON: Using comparison to false is error prone

Comparisons of A to true and false are better written
as A and !A.
