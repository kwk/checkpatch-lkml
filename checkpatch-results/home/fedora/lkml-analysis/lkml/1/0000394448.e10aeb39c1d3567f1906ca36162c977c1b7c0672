ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#102: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:407:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#107: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:412:
+	if (test_bit(TTY_FLUSHING, &tty->flags)) {
[...]
+	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#111: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:416:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation
