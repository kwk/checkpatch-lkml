#46: 
    Signed-off-by: Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#67: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:2435:
+				       "internal sector size %lld does not "
+				       "match drive-supplied size %lld\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#94: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:488:
+		unsigned sect_size = scsidev->sector_size;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#95: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:489:
+		unsigned sect_size = scsidev->sector_size;
+		argsize = sect_size * args[3];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
