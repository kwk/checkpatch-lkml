CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#162: FILE: arch/ia64/mm/discontig.c:75:
+#define VMEMMAP_PRESENT (1UL << 31)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#188: FILE: arch/ia64/mm/discontig.c:101:
+		} else {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
