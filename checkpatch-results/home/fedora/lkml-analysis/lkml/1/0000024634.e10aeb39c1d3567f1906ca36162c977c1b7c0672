#41: 
Subject: [PATCH 7/9] MTD: add few workarounds to nand system for SmartMedia/xD chips.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'beeing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'being'?
#67: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c:402:
+	/* broken xD cards report WP despite beeing writable */
 	                                     ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#76: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c:410:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "type->name"
#95: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c:2643:
+	for (i = 0; type->name != NULL; type++)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#126: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_ids.c:132:
+struct nand_flash_dev nand_smartmedia_flash_ids[] = {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
