+menuconfig APM
+	tristate "APM (Advanced Power Management) BIOS support"
+	depends on X86_32 && PM_SLEEP && !X86_VISWS
+	---help---
+	  APM is a BIOS specification for saving power using several different
+	  techniques. This is mostly useful for battery powered laptops with
+	  APM compliant BIOSes. If you say Y here, the system time will be
+	  reset after a RESUME operation, the /proc/apm device will provide
+	  battery status information, and user-space programs will receive
+	  notification of APM "events" (e.g. battery status change).
+
+	  If you select "Y" here, you can disable actual use of the APM
+	  BIOS by passing the "apm=off" option to the kernel at boot time.
+
+	  Note that the APM support is almost completely disabled for
+	  machines with more than one CPU.
+
+	  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location
+	  and more information, read <file:Documentation/pm.txt> and the
+	  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
+	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.
+
+	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)
+	  manpage ("man 8 hdparm") for that), and it doesn't turn off
+	  VESA-compliant "green" monitors.
+
+	  This driver does not support the TI 4000M TravelMate and the ACER
+	  486/DX4/75 because they don't have compliant BIOSes. Many "green"
+	  desktop machines also don't have compliant BIOSes, and this driver
+	  may cause those machines to panic during the boot phase.
+
+	  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't
+	  much point in using this driver and you should say N. If you get
+	  random kernel OOPSes or reboots that don't seem to be related to
+	  anything, try disabling/enabling this option (or disabling/enabling
+	  APM in your BIOS).
+
+	  Some other things you should try when experiencing seemingly random,
+	  "weird" problems:
+
+	  1) make sure that you have enough swap space and that it is
+	  enabled.
+	  2) pass the "no-hlt" option to the kernel
+	  3) switch on floating point emulation in the kernel and pass
+	  the "no387" option to the kernel
+	  4) pass the "floppy=nodma" option to the kernel
+	  5) pass the "mem=4M" option to the kernel (thereby disabling
+	  all but the first 4 MB of RAM)
+	  6) make sure that the CPU is not over clocked.
+	  7) read the sig11 FAQ at <http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/>
+	  8) disable the cache from your BIOS settings
+	  9) install a fan for the video card or exchange video RAM
+	  10) install a better fan for the CPU
+	  11) exchange RAM chips
+	  12) exchange the motherboard.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called apm.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#122: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:69:
+config APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND
+	bool "Ignore USER SUSPEND"
+	help
+	  This option will ignore USER SUSPEND requests. On machines with a
+	  compliant APM BIOS, you want to say N. However, on the NEC Versa M
+	  series notebooks, it is necessary to say Y because of a BIOS bug.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#129: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:76:
+config APM_DO_ENABLE
+	bool "Enable PM at boot time"
+	---help---
+	  Enable APM features at boot time. From page 36 of the APM BIOS
+	  specification: "When disabled, the APM BIOS does not automatically
+	  power manage devices, enter the Standby State, enter the Suspend
+	  State, or take power saving steps in response to CPU Idle calls."
+	  This driver will make CPU Idle calls when Linux is idle (unless this
+	  feature is turned off -- see "Do CPU IDLE calls", below). This
+	  should always save battery power, but more complicated APM features
+	  will be dependent on your BIOS implementation. You may need to turn
+	  this option off if your computer hangs at boot time when using APM
+	  support, or if it beeps continuously instead of suspending. Turn
+	  this off if you have a NEC UltraLite Versa 33/C or a Toshiba
+	  T400CDT. This is off by default since most machines do fine without
+	  this feature.
