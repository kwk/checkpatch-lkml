CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: include/linux/relay.h:184:
+extern ssize_t relay_kernel_read(struct rchan_buf *rbuf,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#103: FILE: kernel/relay.c:1000:
+	void *from = buf->start + read_start;
+	memcpy(desc->arg.data, from, avail);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
