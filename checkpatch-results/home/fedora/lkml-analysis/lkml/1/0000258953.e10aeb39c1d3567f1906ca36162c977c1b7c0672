#56: 
from fs.h to string.h and fixes includes in existing memory_read_from_buffer()

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#94: FILE: include/linux/string.h:114:
+extern ssize_t memory_read_from_buffer(void *to, size_t count, loff_t *ppos,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#95: FILE: include/linux/string.h:115:
+extern ssize_t memory_read_from_buffer(void *to, size_t count, loff_t *ppos,
+			const void *from, size_t available);
