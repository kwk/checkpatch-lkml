Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#213: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-sff.c:773:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#430: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:212:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#449: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:697:
+	/* Flags owned by the EH context. Only EH should touch these once the
+	   port is active */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#459: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:1605:
+extern int ata_sff_port_start32(struct ata_port *ap);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
