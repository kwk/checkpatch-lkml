WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#30: 
#includes.  Clean it all up, and go around fixing up everything else

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#59: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/xen/hypercall.h:43:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
