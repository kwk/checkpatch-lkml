If it is freed, page alloctor may use it which will be removed
                     ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

+static void free_map_bootmem(struct page *page, unsigned long nr_pages)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#92: FILE: mm/sparse.c:413:
+		BUG_ON(magic == NODE_INFO);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#141: FILE: mm/sparse.c:458:
+		struct page *memmap_page;
+		memmap_page = virt_to_page(memmap);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#174: FILE: mm/internal.h:37:
+extern void __free_pages_bootmem(struct page *page, unsigned int order);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
