CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: arch/powerpc/include/asm/ptrace.h:138:
+extern int regs_query_register_offset(const char *name);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
