It is recomended to compile your userspace programs with frame pointers
      ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#136: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/stacktrace.c:132:
+			struct stack_frame frame;
+			frame.next_fp = NULL;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#164: FILE: include/linux/stacktrace.h:23:
+extern void save_stack_trace_user(struct stack_trace *trace);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#193: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:767:
+static void ftrace_trace_userstack(struct trace_array *tr,
+		   struct trace_array_cpu *data,
