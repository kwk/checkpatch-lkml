WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#107: FILE: drivers/kvm/svm.c:1045:
+			printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: get io address failed\n",

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#108: FILE: drivers/kvm/svm.c:1046:
+			       __FUNCTION__);

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#115: FILE: drivers/kvm/svm.c:1052:
+			kvm_run->io.count
+				= vcpu->regs[VCPU_REGS_RCX] & addr_mask;

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#120: FILE: drivers/kvm/svm.c:1056:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
