The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'oldest == NULL'
#165: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ipw2200.c:7569:
+				if ((oldest == NULL) ||
+				    (target->last_scanned < oldest->last_scanned))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'target->last_scanned < oldest->last_scanned'
#165: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ipw2200.c:7569:
+				if ((oldest == NULL) ||
+				    (target->last_scanned < oldest->last_scanned))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!oldest"
#165: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ipw2200.c:7569:
+				if ((oldest == NULL) ||

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
