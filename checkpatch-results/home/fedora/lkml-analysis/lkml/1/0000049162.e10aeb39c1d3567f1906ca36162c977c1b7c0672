CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#50: FILE: drivers/scsi/hpsa.c:183:
+	return (struct ctlr_info *) *priv;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#50: FILE: drivers/scsi/hpsa.c:183:
+	unsigned long *priv = shost_priv(sdev->host);
+	return (struct ctlr_info *) *priv;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
