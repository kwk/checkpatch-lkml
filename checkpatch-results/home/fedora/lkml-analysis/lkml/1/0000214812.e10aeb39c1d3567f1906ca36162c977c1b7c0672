WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#74: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:604:
+config CPUMASK_OFFSTACK
+	bool "Force CPU masks off stack" if DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS
+	help
+	  Use dynamic allocation for cpumask_var_t, instead of putting
+	  them on the stack.  This is a bit more expensive, but avoids
+	  stack overflow.
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
