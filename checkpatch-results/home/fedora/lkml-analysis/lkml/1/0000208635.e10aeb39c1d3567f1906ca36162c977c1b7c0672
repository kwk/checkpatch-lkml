#43: 
I'm just wondering how to support hirerachy and not indend to improve this now.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'hierachical' may be misspelled - perhaps 'hierarchical'?

[1/2] ... hierachical res_counter 
          ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'intialized' may be misspelled - perhaps 'initialized'?
#55: 
By this, if res_counter is properly intialized, a charge to res_counter
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
