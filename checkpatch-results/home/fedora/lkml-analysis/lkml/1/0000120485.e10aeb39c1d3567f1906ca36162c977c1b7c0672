WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#283: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#288: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/util/parse-events.c:1:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'config' may be better as '(config)' to avoid precedence issues

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#425: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/util/parse-events.h:5:
+extern int parse_events(const struct option *opt, const char *str, int unset);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
