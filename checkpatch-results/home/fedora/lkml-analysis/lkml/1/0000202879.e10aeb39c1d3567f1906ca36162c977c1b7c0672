CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#83: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c:49:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#110: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c:389:
+^I * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#129: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c:408:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
