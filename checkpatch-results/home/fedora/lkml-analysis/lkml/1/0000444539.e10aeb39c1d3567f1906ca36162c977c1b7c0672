WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#166: FILE: kernel/posix-cpu-timers.c:454:
+		if (timer->expires.sched < sum_exec_runtime) {
[...]
 		} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#455: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1164:
+	p->sum_exec_runtime = p->wait_runtime = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#489: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1239:
+	if (!sysctl_sched_child_runs_first || (clone_flags & CLONE_VM) ||
+			task_cpu(p) != this_cpu || !current->on_rq) {

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
