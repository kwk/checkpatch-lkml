CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#323: FILE: mm/rmap.c:217:
+		holder->vm_start = holder->vm_end = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
