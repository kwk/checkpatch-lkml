CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:364:
+extern int software_resume(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#93: FILE: init/do_mounts_initrd.c:73:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "TuxOnIce: No attempt was made to resume from "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#94: FILE: init/do_mounts_initrd.c:74:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "TuxOnIce: No attempt was made to resume from "
+				"any image that might exist.\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
