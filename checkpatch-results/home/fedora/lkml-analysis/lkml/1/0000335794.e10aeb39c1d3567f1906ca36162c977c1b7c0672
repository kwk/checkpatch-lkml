Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#147: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgtable_32.h:196:
+extern pte_t *lookup_address(unsigned long address, int *level);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
