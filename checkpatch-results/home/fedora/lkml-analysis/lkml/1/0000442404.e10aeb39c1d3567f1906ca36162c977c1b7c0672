CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#69: FILE: include/linux/kthread.h:46:
+	struct task_struct *__k						   \
+		= kthread_create(threadfn, data, namefmt, ## __VA_ARGS__); \

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#101: FILE: kernel/kthread.c:195:
+	int ret;
+	ret = kthread_stop(task);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
