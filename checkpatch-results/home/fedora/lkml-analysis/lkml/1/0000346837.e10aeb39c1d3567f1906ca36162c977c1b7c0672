Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#63: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/p4.c:174:
+			misc[0] = addr[0] = '\0';

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
