ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#148: FILE: include/linux/init.h:245:
+void __init parse_early_param_alone(char * param);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#160: FILE: init/main.c:480:
 	for (p = __setup_start; p < __setup_end; p++) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#178: FILE: init/main.c:504:
+	BUG_ON(!alone_param);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

#187: FILE: init/main.c:513:

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after tmp_cmdline[COMMAND_LINE_SIZE]
#209: FILE: init/main.c:535:
+       static __initdata char tmp_cmdline[COMMAND_LINE_SIZE];

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
