WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#121: FILE: drivers/pnp/interface.c:406:
+				start = simple_strtoul(buf, &buf, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
