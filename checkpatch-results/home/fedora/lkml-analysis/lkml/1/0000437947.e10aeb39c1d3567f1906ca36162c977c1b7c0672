#23: 
Define a new IGNORE_IOCTL() to let a compat ioctl not be warned about even when

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#50: FILE: fs/compat_ioctl.c:2400:
+/* ioctl should not be warned about even if it's not implemented.
+   Valid reasons to use this:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#55: FILE: fs/compat_ioctl.c:2405:
+   Most other reasons are not valid. */
