CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#81: FILE: include/linux/rbtree.h:124:
+	node->rb_parent_color = (unsigned long) parent;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#82: FILE: include/linux/rbtree.h:125:
+	node->rb_left = node->rb_right = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
