Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#72: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#77: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/wm831x_bl.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#188: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/wm831x_bl.c:112:
+	struct wm831x_backlight_data *data = bl_get_data(bl);
+	return data->current_brightness;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct backlight_ops should normally be const
#191: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/wm831x_bl.c:115:
+static struct backlight_ops wm831x_backlight_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <max_uA>
#221: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/wm831x_bl.c:145:
+		if (wm831x_isinkv_values[i] > pdata->max_uA)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!data"
#263: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/wm831x_bl.c:187:
+	if (data == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#271: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/wm831x_bl.c:195:
+	bl = backlight_device_register("wm831x", &pdev->dev,
+			data, &wm831x_backlight_ops);
