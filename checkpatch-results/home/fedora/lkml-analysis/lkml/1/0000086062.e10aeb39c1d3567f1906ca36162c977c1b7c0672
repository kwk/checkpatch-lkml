CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/mc146818rtc.h> instead of <asm/mc146818rtc.h>
#72: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/time.h:4:
+#include <asm/mc146818rtc.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/time.h:7:
+extern void time_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#82: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/time.h:11:
+	int		(*set_wall_time)(unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#84: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/time.h:13:
+};
+extern struct arch_rtc_dev_ops *x86_rtc_ops;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
