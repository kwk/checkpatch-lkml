patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#98: FILE: arch/score/include/asm/irq.h:23:
+extern void interrupt_exception_vector(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
