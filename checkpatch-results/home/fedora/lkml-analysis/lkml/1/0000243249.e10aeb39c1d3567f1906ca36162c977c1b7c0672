CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#89: FILE: include/linux/ftrace.h:145:
+extern void ftrace_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#208: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:1552:
+extern unsigned long __stop_mcount_loc[];

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#232: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:1576:
+	last_ftrace_enabled = ftrace_enabled = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#247: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:1591:
+	while (!kthread_should_stop()) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#264: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:1608:
+				pr_info("hm, dftrace overflow: %lu change%s"
+					" (%lu total) in %lu usec%s\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
