WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#188: FILE: block/blk-io-throttle.c:246:
+	if (strict_strtoul(ioratep, 10, iorate))

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#300: FILE: block/blk-io-throttle.c:408:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
