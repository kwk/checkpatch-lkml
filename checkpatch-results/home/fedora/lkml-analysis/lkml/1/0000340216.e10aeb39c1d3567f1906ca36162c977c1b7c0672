WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct hrtimer *' should also have an identifier name
#69: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1043:
+		enum hrtimer_restart (*fn)(struct hrtimer *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#88: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1062:
+			BUG_ON(hrtimer_active(timer));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#117: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1091:
+	if (timer->cb_mode == HRTIMER_CB_IRQSAFE_NO_SOFTIRQ) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#402: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:320:
+extern void hrtimer_run_pending(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
