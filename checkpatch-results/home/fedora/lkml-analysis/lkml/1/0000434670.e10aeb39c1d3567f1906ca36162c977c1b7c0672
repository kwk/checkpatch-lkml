CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <MaxSector>
#156: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:277:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#209: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:2302:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#211: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:2304:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoull is obsolete, use kstrtoull instead
#263: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:2936:
+	unsigned long long new = simple_strtoull(buf, &e, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#277: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:2950:
+__ATTR(reshape_position, S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR, reshape_position_show,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
