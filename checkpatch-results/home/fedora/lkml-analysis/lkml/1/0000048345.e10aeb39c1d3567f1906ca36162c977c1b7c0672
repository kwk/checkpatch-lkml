CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#110: FILE: drivers/md/dm-crypt.c:691:
+	if (io->base_bio->bi_rw & (1 << BIO_RW_SYNCIO)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#125: FILE: drivers/md/dm-crypt.c:706:
+		struct backing_dev_info *bdi;
+		bdi = blk_get_backing_dev_info(io->base_bio->bi_bdev);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
