CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#54: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_64.c:1159:
+		if (x86_bios_cpu_apicid_early_ptr) {
[...]
+		else if (i < nr_cpu_ids) {
[...]
+		else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#57: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_64.c:1162:
+		}
+		else if (i < nr_cpu_ids) {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#63: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_64.c:1168:
+		}
+		else

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#85: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse_64.c:71:
+u16 x86_bios_cpu_apicid_init[NR_CPUS] __initdata
+				= { [0 ... NR_CPUS-1] = BAD_APICID };

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#85: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse_64.c:71:
+				= { [0 ... NR_CPUS-1] = BAD_APICID };
 				                  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
