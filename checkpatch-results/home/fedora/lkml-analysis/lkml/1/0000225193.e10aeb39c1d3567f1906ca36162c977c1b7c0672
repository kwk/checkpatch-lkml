Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#110: FILE: include/linux/hugetlb.h:236:
+extern unsigned long vma_mmu_pagesize(struct vm_area_struct *vma);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
