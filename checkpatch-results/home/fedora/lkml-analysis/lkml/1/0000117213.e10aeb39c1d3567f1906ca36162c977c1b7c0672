During a revoke operation it is necessary to stop using all state that is managed

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#93: FILE: fs/select.c:955:
+		struct poll_table_entry *entry;
+		if (curr->func != pollwake)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?

 		           ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#121: FILE: include/linux/poll.h:134:
+extern void unpoll_file(wait_queue_head_t *q, struct file *file);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
