Robustness improvements: add DMA error handling to the ISR, move common code

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'channel <= IDMAC_IC_13'
#141: FILE: drivers/dma/ipu/ipu_idmac.c:695:
+	if ((channel <= IDMAC_IC_13) && (stride % 8)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#193: FILE: drivers/dma/ipu/ipu_idmac.c:815:
+static int ipu_submit_buffer(struct idmac_channel *ichan,
+	struct idmac_tx_desc *desc, struct scatterlist *sg, int buf_idx)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#345: FILE: drivers/dma/ipu/ipu_idmac.c:1204:
+static struct scatterlist *idmac_sg_next(struct idmac_channel *ichan,

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#429: FILE: drivers/dma/ipu/ipu_idmac.c:1295:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#432: FILE: drivers/dma/ipu/ipu_idmac.c:1298:
+				"Buffer deactivated on channel %x, active "
+				"%d, ready %x, %x, current %x, rest %d!\n", chan_id,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#469: FILE: drivers/dma/ipu/ipu_idmac.c:1340:
+		irq, sg_dma_address(*sg), sgnext ? sg_dma_address(sgnext) : 0, ichan->active_buffer, curbuf);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
