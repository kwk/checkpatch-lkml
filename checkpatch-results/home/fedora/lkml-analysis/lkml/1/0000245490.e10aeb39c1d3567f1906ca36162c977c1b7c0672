WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#58: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:1:
+#ifdef CONFIG_PM

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#64: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:7:
+extern int dpm_sysfs_add(struct device *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:8:
+extern void dpm_sysfs_remove(struct device *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct device *' should also have an identifier name
#65: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:8:
+extern void dpm_sysfs_remove(struct device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
