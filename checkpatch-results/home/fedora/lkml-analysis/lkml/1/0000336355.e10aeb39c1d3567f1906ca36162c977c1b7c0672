WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#33: 
# modprobe usbserial vendor=0x413c product=0x8129

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'seesion' may be misspelled - perhaps 'session'?
#35: 
Following seesion lines describe modem itself
          ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 146 exceeds 100 columns

+	{ USB_DEVICE(DELL_VENDOR_ID, 0x8129) },	/* Dell Wireless 5700 Mobile Broadband CDMA/EVDO Mini-Card == Novatel Expedite ET620 CDMA/EV-DO */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
