CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: include/linux/lockdep.h:317:
+extern void lock_set_class(struct lockdep_map *lock, const char *name,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#82: FILE: include/linux/lockdep.h:322:
+static inline void lock_set_subclass(struct lockdep_map *lock,
+		unsigned int subclass, unsigned long ip)
