Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open brace '{'

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#66: FILE: sound/sh/aica.c:224:
+	while (!maple_dma_done());

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:WHILE_AFTER_BRACE: while should follow close brace '}'
#66: FILE: sound/sh/aica.c:224:
+	do{ cpu_relax();}
+	while (!maple_dma_done());

while should follow the closing bracket on the same line::

  do {
          ...
  } while(something);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
