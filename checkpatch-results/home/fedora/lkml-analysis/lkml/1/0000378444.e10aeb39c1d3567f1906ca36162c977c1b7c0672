ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#166: FILE: drivers/char/mspec.c:186:
 			printk(KERN_WARNING "mspec_close(): "
+			       "failed to zero page %ld\n", my_page);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#184: FILE: drivers/char/mspec.c:209:
+	BUG_ON(address < vdata->vm_start || address >= vdata->vm_end);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#195: FILE: drivers/char/mspec.c:253:
+mspec_mmap(struct file *file, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
+					enum mspec_page_type type)

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#208: FILE: drivers/char/mspec.c:271:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
