CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#382: FILE: lib/list_sort.c:35:
+		p = oldhead = list;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
