WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#54: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsctl.c:176:
+extern int nfsd_pool_stats_release(struct inode *inode, struct file *file);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#83: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:610:
+	int ret;
+	mutex_lock(&nfsd_mutex);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!nfsd_serv"
#84: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:611:
+	if (nfsd_serv == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'psudo' may be misspelled - perhaps 'pseudo'?
#89: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:615:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
