CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#47: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/ipl.c:1091:
+		disabled_wait((unsigned long) __builtin_return_address(0));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#48: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/ipl.c:1092:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#50: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/ipl.c:1094:
+		for (;;);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
