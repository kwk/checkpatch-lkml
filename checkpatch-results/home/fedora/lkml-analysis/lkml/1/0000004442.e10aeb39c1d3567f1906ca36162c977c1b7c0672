#27: 
This patch converts the parisc architecture to use the generic read_persistent_clock and update_persistent_clock interfaces, reducing the amount of arch specific code we have to maintain, and allowing for further cleanups in the future.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#57: FILE: arch/parisc/kernel/time.c:260:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "Error reading tod clock\n");

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
