WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#20: 
Subject: Re: random.c changes for sparse irq_desc are crap

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#63: FILE: include/linux/random.h:78:
+	BUG_ON(!desc);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
