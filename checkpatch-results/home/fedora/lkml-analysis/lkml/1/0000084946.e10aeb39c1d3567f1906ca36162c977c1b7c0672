ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *const* bar" should be "foo *const*bar"
#81: FILE: brctl/brctl_cmd.c:398:
+static int br_cmd_hairpin(int argc, char *const* argv)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#94: FILE: brctl/brctl_cmd.c:411:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#158: FILE: libbridge/libbridge.h:117:
+extern int br_set_hairpin_mode(const char *bridge, const char *dev,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
