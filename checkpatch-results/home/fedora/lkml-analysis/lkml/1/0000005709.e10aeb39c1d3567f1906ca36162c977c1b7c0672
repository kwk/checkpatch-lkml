ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#55: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/amd.c:140:
===================================================================

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#59: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/amd.c:142:
+		/* Geode only lacks the NOPL instruction to be i686,
+		   but we can emulate it in the exception handler

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#82: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#83: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c:2:
+ *  linux/arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#89: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c:8:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#103: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c:22:
+	int length = 3;
+	switch (*ip) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#143: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c:62:
+		int res = do_0f(ip + 1);
+		if (res)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#180: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/nopl_emu.c:99:
+	if (res) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
