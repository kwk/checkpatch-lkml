CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "__module_address"
#130: FILE: kernel/module.c:2726:
+	ret = __module_address(addr) != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#158: FILE: kernel/module.c:2748:
+		if (within_module_core(addr, mod)
+		    || within_module_init(addr, mod))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "__module_text_address"
#176: FILE: kernel/module.c:2766:
+	ret = __module_text_address(addr) != NULL;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#192: FILE: kernel/module.c:2782:
+	struct module *mod = __module_address(addr);
+	if (mod) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
