Subject: [PATCH 1/3] x86/iommu: make GART driver checkpatch clean

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#58: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-gart_64.c:178:
+		printk_address((unsigned long) iommu_leak_tab[iommu_pages-i],

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#58: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-gart_64.c:178:
+		printk_address((unsigned long) iommu_leak_tab[iommu_pages-i],
 		                                                         ^

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#59: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-gart_64.c:179:
+		printk_address((unsigned long) iommu_leak_tab[iommu_pages-i],
+				0);

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#69: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-gart_64.c:693:
+		panic("Could not register gart_sysdev -- "
+		      "would corrupt data on next suspend");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#88: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-gart_64.c:780:
 			printk(KERN_WARNING "More than 4GB of memory "
+			       "but GART IOMMU not available.\n");

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#89: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-gart_64.c:781:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#111: FILE: include/asm-x86/gart.h:32:
+extern int agp_amd64_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
