CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#187: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess_64.h:191:
+extern long __copy_user_page_nocache(void *dst, const void __user *src);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
