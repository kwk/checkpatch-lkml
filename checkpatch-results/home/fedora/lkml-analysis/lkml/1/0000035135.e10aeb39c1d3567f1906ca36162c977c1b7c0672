ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo	* bar" should be "foo	*bar"
#128: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:56:
+	const struct sysfs_ops	* ops;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
