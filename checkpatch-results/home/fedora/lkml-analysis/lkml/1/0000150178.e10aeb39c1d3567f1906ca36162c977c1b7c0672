the following patch (on top of 2.6.29) converts Smack lists to standard linux lists

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!kp->smk_cipso"
#303: FILE: security/smack/smack_access.c:382:
+	if (found == 0 || kp->smk_cipso == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
