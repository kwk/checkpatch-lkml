WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'agressive' may be misspelled - perhaps 'aggressive'?
#43: 
We are a bit agressive in invalidating all the pages. But
             ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#80: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1842:
+			struct page *page = pvec.pages[i];
+			index = page->index;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#85: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1847:
+			BUG_ON(!PageLocked(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#126: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1891:
+	if (err) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
