ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#130: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:577:
+                pagemap_ppte_t ppte = PM_NOT_PRESENT;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#130: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:577:
+                pagemap_ppte_t ppte = PM_NOT_PRESENT;$

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#139: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:582:
+			swp_entry_t e = pte_to_swp_entry(*pte);
+			ppte.pm_swap   = 1;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#159: FILE: include/linux/pagemap_ppte.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
