#29: 
Rewrite unionfs_writepage to minimize dependence on AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVEATE,

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#128: FILE: fs/unionfs/mmap.c:70:
+	BUG_ON(!lower_mapping->a_ops->writepage);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
