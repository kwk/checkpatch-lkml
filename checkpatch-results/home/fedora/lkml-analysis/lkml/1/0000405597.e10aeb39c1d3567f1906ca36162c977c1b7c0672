Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#235: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:592:
+	if (!fb_logo.logo) {
+		return 0;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#294: FILE: include/linux/linux_logo.h:37:
+extern void fb_append_extra_logo(const struct linux_logo *logo,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
