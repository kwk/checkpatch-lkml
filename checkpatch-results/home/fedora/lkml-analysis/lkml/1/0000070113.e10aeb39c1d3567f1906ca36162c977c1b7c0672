CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#127: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:920:
+extern void blk_queue_copy_limits(struct request_queue *q, struct queue_limits *lim);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
