WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#48: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:616:
+static struct hpt_info *hpt3xx_get_info(void *host_priv, struct device *hwif_dev, struct device *host_dev)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#51: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:619:
+	struct hpt_info *info = (struct hpt_info *)host_priv;
+	if (hwif_dev == host_dev)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
