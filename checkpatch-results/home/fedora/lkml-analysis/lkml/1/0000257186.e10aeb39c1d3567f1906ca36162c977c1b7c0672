Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#74: FILE: include/linux/mfd/core.h:43:
+	struct platform_device *pdev = to_platform_device(dev);
+	return container_of(pdev, struct mfd_device, pdev);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*mdev)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct mfd_device)...)
#113: FILE: drivers/mfd/mfd-core.c:36:
+	mdev = kzalloc(sizeof(struct mfd_device) +

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
