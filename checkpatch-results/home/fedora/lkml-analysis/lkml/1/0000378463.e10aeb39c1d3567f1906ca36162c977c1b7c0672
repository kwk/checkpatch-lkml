the preceeding patches to change at all.
    ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#98: FILE: fs/namespace.c:56:
+#define MNT_WRITER_UNDERFLOW_LIMIT -(1<<16)
                                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ouside' may be misspelled - perhaps 'outside'?
#119: FILE: fs/namespace.c:96:
+ * This shouldn't be used directly ouside of the VFS.
                                    ^^^^^^

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#146: FILE: fs/namespace.c:123:
+	int cpu;
+	for_each_possible_cpu(cpu) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#148: FILE: fs/namespace.c:125:
+		struct mnt_writer *writer = &per_cpu(mnt_writers, cpu);
+		spin_lock_init(&writer->lock);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#174: FILE: fs/namespace.c:151:
+ /*
+ * must hold cpu_writer->lock

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#177: FILE: fs/namespace.c:154:

+					  struct vfsmount *mnt)
