CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vaddr"
#65: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:251:
+	if (vaddr == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#122: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:465:
+	user_data = (char __user *) (uintptr_t) args->data_ptr;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!data"
#126: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:469:
+	if (data == NULL)

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#154: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:497:
+		page_base = (offset & ~(PAGE_SIZE-1));
 		                                 ^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#155: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:498:

 		                                 ^

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#209: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:1008:
+	BUG_ON(obj_priv->page_list_refcount < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
