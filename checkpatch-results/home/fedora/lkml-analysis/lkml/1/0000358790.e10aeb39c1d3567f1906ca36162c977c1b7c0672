#27: 
This fixes some problems with ATAPI devices on nForce4 controllers in ADMA mode

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#69: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_nv.c:765:
+			/* Transitioning to ADMA mode. Free legacy PRD table

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
