ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#83: FILE: drivers/serial/68328serial.c:377:
+	struct m68k_serial * info = dev_id;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!i->head"
#142: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1544:
+	if (i->head == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*i)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct irq_info)...)
#167: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1568:
+		i = kzalloc(sizeof(struct irq_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#202: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1616:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#205: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1619:
+	if (list_empty(i->head)) {
 		free_irq(up->port.irq, i);

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
