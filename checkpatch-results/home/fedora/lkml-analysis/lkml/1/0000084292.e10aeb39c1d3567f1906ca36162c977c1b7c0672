CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#149: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_mpc8xxx.c:122:
+#define	SPCOM_STR	(1 << 23)	/* Start transmit */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#213: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_mpc8xxx.c:255:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
