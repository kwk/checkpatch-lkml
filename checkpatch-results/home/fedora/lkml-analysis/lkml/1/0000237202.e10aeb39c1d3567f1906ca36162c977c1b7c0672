WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#43: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#48: FILE: fs/axfs/axfs_mtd.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#111: FILE: fs/axfs/axfs_mtd.c:64:
+	if (!strncmp(mtdblk, off, strlen(mtdblk))
+	    && isdigit(off[strlen(mtdblk)]))

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#114: FILE: fs/axfs/axfs_mtd.c:67:
+	*mtdnr = simple_strtoul(off, &endptr, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "AXFS_MTD1"
#132: FILE: fs/axfs/axfs_mtd.c:85:
+	if (AXFS_MTD1(sb) != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#143: FILE: fs/axfs/axfs_mtd.c:96:
+	u_char *mtdbuf = (u_char *) dst;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#151: FILE: fs/axfs/axfs_mtd.c:104:
+	err = mtd->read(mtd, (loff_t) offset, (size_t) len, &retlen, mtdbuf);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#220: FILE: fs/axfs/axfs_mtd.c:173:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
