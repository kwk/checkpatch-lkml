CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#98: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:691:
+		} else		/* cmd == REQ_UNPARK_HEADS */

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#103: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:696:
+		drive->hwif->data_phase = task.data_phase = TASKFILE_NO_DATA;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
