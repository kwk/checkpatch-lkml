CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#94: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:281:
+extern int hex_to_int(char c);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: const array should probably be static const
#108: FILE: lib/hexdump.c:15:

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
