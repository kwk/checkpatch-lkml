CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#100: FILE: include/linux/sysfs.h:23:
+extern int kobject_set_name(struct kobject *kobj, const char *name, ...)

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __printf(2, 3) over __attribute__((format(printf, 2, 3)))
#101: FILE: include/linux/sysfs.h:24:
+			    __attribute__((format(printf, 2, 3)));
