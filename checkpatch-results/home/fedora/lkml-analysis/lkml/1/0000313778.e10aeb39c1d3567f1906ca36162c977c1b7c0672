Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#260: FILE: include/linux/slub_def.h:37:
+^I^I^I^I ^I * object. The MSBs are used as a$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#260: FILE: include/linux/slub_def.h:37:

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#368: FILE: mm/slub.c:1674:
+		 * object free will lead to counter re-use. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#380: FILE: mm/slub.c:1685:
+	if (unlikely(is_end(c->freeoffset) || !node_match(c, node)))
[...]
 	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
