ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#86: 
--- a/include/linux/security.h~mm-nommuc-fix-improperly-call-of-security-api-in-mmap

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'addr < dac_mmap_min_addr'
#228: FILE: security/commoncap.c:1008:
+	if (!(sec_flags & SECURITY_MMAP_NOT_ADDR) &&

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
