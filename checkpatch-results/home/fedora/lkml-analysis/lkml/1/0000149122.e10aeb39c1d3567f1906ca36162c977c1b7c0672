#30: 
compiler warning when irqreturn_t is turned into an enum in the near future:

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#59: FILE: arch/m68k/include/asm/irq_mm.h:84:
+	irqreturn_t	(*handler)(int, void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#59: FILE: arch/m68k/include/asm/irq_mm.h:84:
+	irqreturn_t	(*handler)(int, void *);
