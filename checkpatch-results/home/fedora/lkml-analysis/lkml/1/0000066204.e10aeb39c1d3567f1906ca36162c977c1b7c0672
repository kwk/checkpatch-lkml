Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#77: FILE: kernel/time/timekeeping.c:572:
+       WARN_ONCE(!irqs_disabled(),$

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#78: FILE: kernel/time/timekeeping.c:573:
+               KERN_INFO "timekeeping_resume() called with IRQs enabled!");$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'timekeeping_resume', this function's name, in a string
#78: FILE: kernel/time/timekeeping.c:573:
+               KERN_INFO "timekeeping_resume() called with IRQs enabled!");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
