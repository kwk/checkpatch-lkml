CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#60: FILE: arch/um/kernel/physmem.c:82:
+#define CHUNK_SIZE (PAGE_SIZE/8)
                              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#63: FILE: arch/um/kernel/physmem.c:85:
+		int i;
+		if (len % (CHUNK_SIZE) != 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#67: FILE: arch/um/kernel/physmem.c:89:
+			if (VALGRIND_GET_VBITS(__va(phys + i), vbits,
+						CHUNK_SIZE) > 1)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#113: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:576:
+	 * the rounded up region of the last page */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
