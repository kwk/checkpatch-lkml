CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:119:
+extern unsigned long long clockevent_delta2ns(unsigned long latch,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#82: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:120:
+extern unsigned long long clockevent_delta2ns(unsigned long latch,
 					 struct clock_event_device *evt);

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#94: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1258:
 	printk(KERN_WARNING "hrtimer: interrupt too slow, "
+		"forcing clock min delta to %llu ns\n", dev->min_delta_ns);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

#108: FILE: kernel/time/clockevents.c:41:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
