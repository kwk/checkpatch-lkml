Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'alloc_chan_prog', this function's name, in a string
#95: FILE: drivers/s390/char/vmur.c:168:
+	TRACE("alloc_chan_prog(%p, %i, %i)\n", ubuf, rec_count, reclen);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
