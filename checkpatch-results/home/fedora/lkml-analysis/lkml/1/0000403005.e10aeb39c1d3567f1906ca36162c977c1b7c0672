WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#40: 
I was imagining having to have "help" messages ... which of course we don't.

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#54: 
#if defined(CONFIG_COMPAT) && defined(CONFIG_COMPAT_FOR_U64_ALIGNMENT)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.
