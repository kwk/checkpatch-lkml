WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'happenning' may be misspelled - perhaps 'happening'?

                                              ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#126: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2395:
+	if (PAGE_CACHE_SIZE == bsize)

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#163: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2432:
+		bh = head = page_buffers(page);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Noone' may be misspelled - perhaps 'No one'?
#183: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2452:
+	 * We want to clear the flag we could have set previously. Noone else
 	                                                           ^^^^^

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#279: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:583:
+	void (*extend_i_size)(struct inode *, loff_t pos, loff_t len);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#316: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1647:
+#define I_HOLE_EXTEND		(1 << __I_HOLE_EXTEND)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
