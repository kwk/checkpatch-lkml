WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#56: FILE: drivers/base/firmware_class.c:54:
+extern struct builtin_fw __end_builtin_fw[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#58: FILE: drivers/base/firmware_class.c:56:
+static struct builtin_fw *__start_builtin_fw = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

#162: FILE: include/linux/firmware.h:26:
+/* We have to play tricks here much like stringify() to get the

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
