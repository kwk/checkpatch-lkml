Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#656: FILE: arch/um/include/net_kern.h:38:
+	int (*read)(int, struct sk_buff *skb, struct uml_net_private *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
