CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#74: FILE: fs/aio.c:1072:
+	setup_timer_on_stack(&to->timer, timeout_func, (unsigned long) to);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#99: FILE: include/linux/poison.h:18:
+#define TIMER_ENTRY_STATIC	((void *) 0x74737461)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#129: FILE: include/linux/timer.h:44:
+extern void init_timer_on_stack(struct timer_list *timer);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#211: FILE: kernel/timer.c:355:
+	switch (state) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!timer->entry.next"
#218: FILE: kernel/timer.c:362:
+		if (timer->entry.next == NULL &&

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#223: FILE: kernel/timer.c:367:
+			return 0;
+		} else {

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#376: FILE: lib/Kconfig.debug:209:
+config DEBUG_OBJECTS_TIMERS
+	bool "Debug timer objects"
+	depends on DEBUG_OBJECTS
+	help
+	  If you say Y here, additional code will be inserted into the
+	  timer routines to track the life time of timer objects and
+	  validate the timer operations.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
