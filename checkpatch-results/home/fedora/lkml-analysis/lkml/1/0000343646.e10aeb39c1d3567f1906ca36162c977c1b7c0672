#32: 
Being related to 2.4 kernel, the information presented in the `Documentation/mips/GT64120.README' file is outdated. Worse, the document contents are plain misleading nowadays because the text mentions files and directories, which have been deleted, moved or restructured for 2.6.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#51: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.
