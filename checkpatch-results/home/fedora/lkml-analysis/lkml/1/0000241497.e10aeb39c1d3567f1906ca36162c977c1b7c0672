#29: 
This patch implements a new freezer subsystem in the control groups framework.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#165: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:95:
+extern int cgroup_frozen(struct task_struct *task);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#181: FILE: init/Kconfig:302:
+config CGROUP_FREEZER
+        bool "control group freezer subsystem"
+        depends on CGROUPS
+        help
+          Provides a way to freeze and unfreeze all tasks in a
+	  cgroup.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#208: FILE: kernel/cgroup_freezer.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*freezer)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct freezer)...)
#340: FILE: kernel/cgroup_freezer.c:133:
+	freezer = kzalloc(sizeof(struct freezer), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#355: FILE: kernel/cgroup_freezer.c:148:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#382: FILE: kernel/cgroup_freezer.c:175:
+	BUG_ON(freezer->state == STATE_FROZEN);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
