WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#487: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#492: FILE: kernel/trace/functions_hlist.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#519: FILE: kernel/trace/functions_hlist.c:28:
+	pg = hlist->pages = hlist->start;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#559: FILE: kernel/trace/functions_hlist.c:68:
+	pg = hlist->start = hlist->pages;

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*hlist->hash)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct hlist_head)...)
#607: FILE: kernel/trace/functions_hlist.c:116:
+	hlist->hash = kzalloc(sizeof(struct hlist_head) * size, GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#607: FILE: kernel/trace/functions_hlist.c:116:
+	hlist->hash = kzalloc(sizeof(struct hlist_head) * size, GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.
