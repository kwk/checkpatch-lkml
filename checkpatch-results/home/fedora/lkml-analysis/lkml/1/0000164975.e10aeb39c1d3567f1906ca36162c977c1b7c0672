WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#66: 
#define trick.  I do this for all of them, so this won't bite us in

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#85: FILE: arch/blackfin/lib/strcmp.c:9:
+int strcmp(const char *dest, const char *src);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
