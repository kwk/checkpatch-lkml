commit c5cca146aa03e1f60fb179df65f0dbaf17bc64ed upstream.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/amd_iommu.h:33:
+extern void amd_iommu_apply_erratum_63(u16 devid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#89: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu_init.c:520:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
