#38: 
states in which to place their devices, but to provide the drivers with this

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#61: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/main.c:37:
+extern int acpi_sleep_prepare(u32 acpi_state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#62: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/main.c:38:
+extern void acpi_power_off(void);

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#81: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/main.c:57:
+		error = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
