WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const struct io_apic_ops *' should also have an identifier name
#59: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/io_apic.h:31:
+void __init set_io_apic_ops(const struct io_apic_ops *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#115: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic/io_apic.c:424:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
