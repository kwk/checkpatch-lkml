Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#196: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1103:
+	int (*revoke)(struct file *, struct address_space *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct address_space *' should also have an identifier name
#196: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1103:
+	int (*revoke)(struct file *, struct address_space *);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#205: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1745:
+extern int generic_file_revoke(struct file *, struct address_space *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
