CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#825: FILE: include/linux/device.h:490:
+extern const char *device_get_devnode(struct device *dev, mode_t *mode, const char **tmp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
