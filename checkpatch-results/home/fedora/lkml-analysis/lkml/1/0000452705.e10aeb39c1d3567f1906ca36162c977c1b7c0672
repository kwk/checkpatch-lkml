The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*desc)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct ubi_volume_desc)...)
#161: FILE: drivers/mtd/ubi/kapi.c:127:
+	desc = kmalloc(sizeof(struct ubi_volume_desc), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
