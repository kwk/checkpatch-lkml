WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'xen_load_gdt', this function's name, in a string

+		printk("xen_load_gdt: %d va=%p mfn=%lx pfn=%lx va'=%p\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#83: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:321:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
