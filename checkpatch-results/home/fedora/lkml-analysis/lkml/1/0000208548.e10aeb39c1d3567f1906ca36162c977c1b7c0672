WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#65: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#70: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/virtext.h:1:
+/* CPU virtualization extensions handling

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#82: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/virtext.h:13:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#121: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/virtext.c:5:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'sucessfully' may be misspelled - perhaps 'successfully'?

                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead
#179: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/virtext.c:63:
+	synchronize_sched();

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#192: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/virtext.c:76:
+	void (*fn)(void);
+	fn = rcu_dereference(virt_disable_fn);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "rcu_dereference"
#204: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/virtext.c:88:
+	return (rcu_dereference(virt_disable_fn) != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
