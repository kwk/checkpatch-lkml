WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#19: 
Subject: [PATCH tip/core/rcu 3/4] Apply Ingo's checkpatch feedback

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#56: FILE: include/linux/rcutree.h:37:
+extern int rcu_cpu_notify(struct notifier_block *self,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#59: FILE: include/linux/rcutree.h:40:
+extern int rcu_expedited_torture_stats(char *page);

grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
