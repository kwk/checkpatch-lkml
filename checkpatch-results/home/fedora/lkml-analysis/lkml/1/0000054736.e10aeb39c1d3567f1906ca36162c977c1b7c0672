Not-Signed-off-by: Borislav Petkov <borislav.petkov@amd.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*s)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct syndrome_table)...)
#77: FILE: drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:2027:
+	s = kzalloc(sizeof(struct syndrome_table), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
