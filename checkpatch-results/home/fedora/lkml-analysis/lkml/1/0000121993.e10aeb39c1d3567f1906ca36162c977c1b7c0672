Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:WAITQUEUE_ACTIVE: waitqueue_active without comment
#311: FILE: kernel/signal.c:2668:

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#348: FILE: kernel/signal.c:2705:
+			pr_err("sighand_struct %p has external references %lu:%u\n", sighand, obj->o_count, cnt);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.
