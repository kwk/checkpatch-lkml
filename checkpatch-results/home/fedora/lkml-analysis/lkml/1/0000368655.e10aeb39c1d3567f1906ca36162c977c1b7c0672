#32: 
Current memory notifier has some defects yet. (Fortunately, nothing uses it.)

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#107: FILE: include/linux/memory.h:44:
+#define	MEM_GOING_ONLINE	(1<<3)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#139: FILE: include/linux/memory.h:74:
+extern int register_memory_notifier(struct notifier_block *nb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
