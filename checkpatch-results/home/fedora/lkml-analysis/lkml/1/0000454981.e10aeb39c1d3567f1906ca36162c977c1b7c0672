Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#313: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1847:
+unsigned long long cycles_2_ns(unsigned long long cyc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#331: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1865:
+void last_cycles_end_susp(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
