#47: 
Add Poll_wait mechanism to SAS-2 MegaRAID SAS Linux driver. Driver will wakeup poll after the driver get event from MegaRAID SAS FW.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around '!cmd->abort_aen'
#91: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c:1306:
+	if ((!cmd->abort_aen) && (instance->unload == 0)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#114: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c:1488:

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#159: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c:3055:
+ * */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#164: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c:3060:
+	unsigned long flags;
+	poll_wait(file, &megasas_poll_wait, wait);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
