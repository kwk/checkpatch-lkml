Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'show_name' to 'name_show'
#181: FILE: drivers/regulator/userspace-consumer.c:91:
+}

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'show_state' to 'state_show' 'set_state' to 'state_store'

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*drvdata)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct userspace_consumer_data)...)
#201: FILE: drivers/regulator/userspace-consumer.c:111:
+	drvdata = kzalloc(sizeof(struct userspace_consumer_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!drvdata"
#202: FILE: drivers/regulator/userspace-consumer.c:112:
+	if (drvdata == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#275: FILE: drivers/regulator/userspace-consumer.c:185:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
