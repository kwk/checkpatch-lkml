Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#326: FILE: arch/mips/sibyte/bcm1480/smp.c:32:
+extern void smp_call_function_single_interrupt(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
