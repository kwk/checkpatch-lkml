WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#32: 
Because we will need it in 'perf top' to support userspace symbols for existing

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'immediatelly' may be misspelled - perhaps 'immediately'?
#37: 
we will just immediatelly create the in memory representation of threads and
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#272: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#277: FILE: tools/perf/util/event.c:1:
+#include <linux/types.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!fp"
#297: FILE: tools/perf/util/event.c:21:
+	if (fp == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!fgets"
#308: FILE: tools/perf/util/event.c:32:
+		if (fgets(bf, sizeof(bf), fp) == NULL)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#313: FILE: tools/perf/util/event.c:37:
+			char *name = bf + 5;
+			while (*name && isspace(*name))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#319: FILE: tools/perf/util/event.c:43:
+			char *tgids = bf + 5;
+			while (*tgids && isspace(*tgids))

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#321: FILE: tools/perf/util/event.c:45:
+			tgid = ev.comm.pid = atoi(tgids);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
