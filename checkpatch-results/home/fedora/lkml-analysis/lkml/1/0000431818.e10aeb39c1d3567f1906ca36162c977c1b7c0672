CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#56: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:37:
+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_CARD_DETECT_INT			(1<<4)
                                       			  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#56: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:37:
+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_CARD_DETECT_INT			(1<<4)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinitdata is unnecessary
#58: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:39:
 static const struct pci_device_id pci_ids[] __devinitdata = {

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#125: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:892:
+	host = (struct sdhci_host*)data;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:ONE_SEMICOLON: Statements terminations use 1 semicolon
#137: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:1361:
+	host->present = readl(host->ioaddr + SDHCI_PRESENT_STATE) & SDHCI_CARD_PRESENT;;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#159: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:1436:
+	if (host->chip->quirks & SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_CARD_DETECT_INT) {
+		del_timer_sync(&host->detect_timer);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
