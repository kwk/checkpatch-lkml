CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/relay_pagewriter.h:288:
+extern void pagewriter_save_flight_data(struct pagewriter *pagewriter);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#161: FILE: kernel/relay_pagewriter.c:624:
+	if(buf->n_pages_flight > buf->pagewriter->n_pages)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
