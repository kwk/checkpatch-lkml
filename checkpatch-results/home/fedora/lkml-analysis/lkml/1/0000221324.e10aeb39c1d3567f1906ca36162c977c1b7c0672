#33: 
Using cpu alloc removes the needs for the per cpu arrays in the kmem_cache struct.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#155: FILE: mm/slub.c:1586:
+	if (unlikely(!object || !node_match(c, node)))
[...]
 	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#412: FILE: mm/slub.c:3952:
+		unsigned x = CPU_PTR(s->cpu_slab, cpu)->stat[si];
