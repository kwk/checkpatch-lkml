CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.h:423:
+extern int trace_selftest_startup_branch(struct tracer *trace,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#128: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_unlikely.c:144:
+struct tracer branch_trace __read_mostly =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
