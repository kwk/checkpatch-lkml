WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#89: FILE: arch/arm/Kconfig:1079:
+source "arch/arm/Kconfig.instrumentation"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#94: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.
