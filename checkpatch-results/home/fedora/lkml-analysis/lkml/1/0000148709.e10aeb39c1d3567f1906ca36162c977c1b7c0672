CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#100: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/kerneltop.c:516:
+		count[0] = count[1] = count[2] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PRINTF_L: %Ld is non-standard C, use %lld
#143: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/kerneltop.c:552:
+			fprintf(stderr, " %14Ld  %-20s (events)",

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#148: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/kerneltop.c:557:
+				(double) count[2] / count[1] * 100);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#174: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/kerneltop.c:1113:
+		case 'l': scale				=	       1; break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
