WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#55: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#60: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9705.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#204: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9705.c:145:
+	/*
+	* mute VIDEO and AUX as they share X and Y touchscreen

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#250: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9705.c:191:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#282: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9705.c:223:
+		u16 data = wm97xx_reg_read(wm, AC97_WM97XX_DIGITISER_RD);
+		if (!(data & WM97XX_PEN_DOWN))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#301: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9705.c:242:
+	while ((wm97xx_reg_read(wm, AC97_WM97XX_DIGITISER1) & WM97XX_POLL)
+	       && timeout) {

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#322: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9705.c:263:
+		dev_dbg(wm->dev, "adc wrong sample, read %x got %x", adcsel,
+		*sample & WM97XX_ADCSEL_MASK);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#347: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9705.c:288:
+	if (pil) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#351: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9705.c:292:
+	} else

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'continous' may be misspelled - perhaps 'continuous'?
#370: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9705.c:311:
+		/* continous mode */
 		   ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#371: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9705.c:312:
+		if (wm->mach_ops->acc_startup &&

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#396: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/wm9705.c:337:
