CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dpath"
#197: FILE: tools/perf/util/module.c:427:
+	if (dpath == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!modfile"
#259: FILE: tools/perf/util/module.c:480:
+		if (modfile == NULL)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#364: FILE: tools/perf/util/parse-events.c:181:
 	for_each_subsystem(sys_dir, sys_dirent, sys_next) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
