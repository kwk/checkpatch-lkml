Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#213: FILE: arch/arm/mach-at91/generic.h:19:
+extern void __init at572d940hf_initialize(unsigned long main_clock);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
