CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/uaccess.h:268:
+extern void copy_from_user_overflow(void)

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+	  The copy_from_user() etc checks are there to help test if there

+	  the copy operation, by having gcc prove that the argument is
+	  within bounds.
+	  If gcc cannot prove that security checks are sufficient runtime
+	  checks will be added.
