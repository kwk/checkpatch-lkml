CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cpu_writer"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - void lock_mnt_writers() should probably be void lock_mnt_writers(void)

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#356: FILE: include/linux/mount.h:84:
+extern void lock_mnt_writers(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
