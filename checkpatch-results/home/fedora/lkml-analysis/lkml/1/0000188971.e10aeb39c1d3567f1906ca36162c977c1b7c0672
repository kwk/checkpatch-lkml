           ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'encounted' may be misspelled - perhaps 'encountered'?
#65: 
entries to the new one. Also, add a bug if a nonlinear condition is encounted
                                                                    ^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#111: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init_32.c:187:
+				BUG_ON(lastpte + PTRS_PER_PTE != newpte);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#112: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init_32.c:188:
+				for (i = 0; i < PTRS_PER_PTE; i++) {
+					set_pte(newpte + i, pte_val(*(pte + i)));
+				}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
