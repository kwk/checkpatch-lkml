WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#90: FILE: net/bluetooth/hidp/core.c:689:
+	  HID_QUIRK_APPLE_NUMLOCK_EMULATION | HID_QUIRK_APPLE_HAS_FN | HID_QUIRK_APPLE_ISO_KEYBOARD },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
