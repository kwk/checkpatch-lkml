ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

+extern int ata_dev_reread_id(struct ata_device *dev, unsigned int readid_flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
