Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#106: 
#include<asm/bug.h>. This is not required as CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_DEBUG_ATOMIC is

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#232: FILE: include/asm-generic/atomic.h:15:
+extern void warn_once(bool condition, char *msg);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#245: FILE: include/asm-generic/atomic.h:28:
+	warn_once((atomic_read(v) > (INT_MAX / 2)),
+		KERN_ERR "atomic inc overflow!");

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#298: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1331:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
