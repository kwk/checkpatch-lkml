Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#71: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c:1279:

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
