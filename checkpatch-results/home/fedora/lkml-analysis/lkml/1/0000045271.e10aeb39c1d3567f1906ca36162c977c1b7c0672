WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#29: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#34: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#35: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:2:
+ * fs/logfs/dir.c	- directory-related code

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#43: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:10:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'seperate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'separate'?

                               ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#100: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:67:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#120: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:87:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'preferrably' may be misspelled - perhaps 'preferably'?
#128: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:95:
+ * of each character and pick a prime nearby, preferrably a bit-sparse
                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#182: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:149:
+	BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#205: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:172:
+		page = read_cache_page(dir->i_mapping, index,
+				(filler_t *)logfs_readpage, NULL);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#257: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:224:
+	inode->i_ctime = dir->i_ctime = dir->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#276: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:243:
+		printk(KERN_ERR"LOGFS: unable to delete inode\n");

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#276: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:243:
+		printk(KERN_ERR"LOGFS: unable to delete inode\n");

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#307: FILE: fs/logfs/dir.c:274:
+ * way to combine the two copies */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
