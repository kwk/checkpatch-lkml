WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#56: FILE: drivers/ide/setup-pci.c:680:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(__ide_setup_pci_device);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_dev *' should also have an identifier name
#76: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1247:
+int __ide_setup_pci_device(struct pci_dev *, const struct ide_port_info *, u8 *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
