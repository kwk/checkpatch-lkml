CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around grp->bb_state
#194: FILE: fs/ext4/balloc.c:956:
+	set_bit(EXT4_GROUP_INFO_NEED_INIT_BIT, &(grp->bb_state));

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
