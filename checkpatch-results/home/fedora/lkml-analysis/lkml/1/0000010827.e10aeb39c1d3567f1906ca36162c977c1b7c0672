CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!event"
#150: FILE: kernel/nmi_watchdog.c:113:
+	if (event == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#158: FILE: kernel/nmi_watchdog.c:121:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "nmi watchdog failed to create perf event on %i: %p\n", cpu, event);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#158: FILE: kernel/nmi_watchdog.c:121:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#193: FILE: kernel/nmi_watchdog.c:156:
+		struct perf_event *event;
+		for_each_online_cpu(cpu) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#209: FILE: kernel/nmi_watchdog.c:172:
+				printk("NMI watchdog failed configuration, "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#210: FILE: kernel/nmi_watchdog.c:173:
+				printk("NMI watchdog failed configuration, "
+					" can not be enabled\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
