WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#57: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1641:
+	int p = 0;
+	if (!info)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
