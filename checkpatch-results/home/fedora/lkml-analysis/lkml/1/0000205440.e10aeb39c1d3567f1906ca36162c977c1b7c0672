WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#231: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:2170:
+	ret = strict_strtoul(buf, 10, &val);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#243: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:2182:
+static struct file_operations rb_simple_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
