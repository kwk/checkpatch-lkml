Just passing a string to mark_tsc_unstable() doesn't allow real code to change

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#122: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/tsc.c:310:
 {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#123: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/tsc.c:311:
+	mark_tsc_unstable(CLOCK_TSC_UNSTABLE_FREQUENCY, (char*)d->ident);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'check_tsc_sync_source', this function's name, in a string
#209: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/tsc_sync.c:142:
+				  "check_tsc_sync_source failed");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'flaged' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flagged'?

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
