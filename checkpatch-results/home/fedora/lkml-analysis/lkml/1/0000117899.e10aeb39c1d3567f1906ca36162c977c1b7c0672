CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#123: FILE: include/linux/ptrace.h:175:
+		ptrace_link(child, task_ptrace(current),
+				current->ptrace_ctx->tracer);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#285: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/mca.c:1798:
+	p->real_parent = p->group_leader = p;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
