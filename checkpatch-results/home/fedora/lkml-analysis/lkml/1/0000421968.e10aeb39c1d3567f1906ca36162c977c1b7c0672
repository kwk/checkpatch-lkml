specified by the community.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#90: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:124:
+#define MS_NO_LEASES	(1<<22)	/* fs does not support leases */
                     	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#90: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:124:
+#define MS_NO_LEASES	(1<<22)	/* fs does not support leases */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
