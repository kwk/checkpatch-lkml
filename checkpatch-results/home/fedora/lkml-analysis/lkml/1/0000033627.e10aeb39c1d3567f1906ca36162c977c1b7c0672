WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns

+		fprintf(stdout, "#\n# (For a higher level overview, try: perf report --sort comm,dso)\n#\n");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
