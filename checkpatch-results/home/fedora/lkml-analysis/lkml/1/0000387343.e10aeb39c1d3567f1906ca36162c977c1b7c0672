CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pipe->bufs)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pipe_buffer)...)
#127: FILE: fs/pipe.c:863:
+		pipe->bufs = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pipe_buffer) * PIPE_DEF_BUFFERS, GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#130: FILE: fs/pipe.c:866:
+			pipe->r_counter = pipe->w_counter = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#184: FILE: fs/pipe.c:1109:
+	bufs = kzalloc(arg * sizeof(struct pipe_buffer), GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#199: FILE: fs/pipe.c:1124:
+			memcpy(bufs + head, pipe->bufs + pipe->curbuf, tail * sizeof(struct pipe_buffer));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

#554: FILE: include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h:152:
+long pipe_fcntl(struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long arg);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
