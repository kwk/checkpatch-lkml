WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+	 * cross-compilation, and the padding is a workaround for this. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument '__u32' should also have an identifier name
#76: FILE: include/linux/mod_devicetable.h:359:
+	__u8	revision

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __aligned(sizeof(__u32)) over __attribute__((aligned(sizeof(__u32))))
#77: FILE: include/linux/mod_devicetable.h:360:
+		__attribute__((aligned(sizeof(__u32))));
