> wrong thing - we should call _PTS() before we start powerding down devices,

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#83: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/main.c:80:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
