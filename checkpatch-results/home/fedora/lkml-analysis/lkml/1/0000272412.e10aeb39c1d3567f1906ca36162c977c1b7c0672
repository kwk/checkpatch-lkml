WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#196: FILE: drivers/watchdog/mpc83xx_wdt.c:206:
+		ret = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
