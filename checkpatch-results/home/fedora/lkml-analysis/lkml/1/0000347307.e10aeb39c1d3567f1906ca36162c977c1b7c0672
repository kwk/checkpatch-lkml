WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#162: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#167: FILE: kernel/timeconst.h:1:
+/* Automatically generated by kernel/timeconst.sh */

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#644: FILE: kernel/timeconst.h:478:
+#error "Update kernel/timeconst.h for your value of HZ"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
