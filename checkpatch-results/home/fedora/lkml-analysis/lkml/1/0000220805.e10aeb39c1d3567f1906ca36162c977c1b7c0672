the patch brings.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <i2BoardPtrTable>
#57: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:432:
+		pB = i2BoardPtrTable[i];

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pB"
#58: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:433:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
