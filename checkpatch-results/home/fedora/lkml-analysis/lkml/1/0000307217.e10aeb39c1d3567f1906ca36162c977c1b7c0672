WARNING:MINMAX: min() should probably be min_t(long, time_constant, MAXTC)
#215: FILE: kernel/time/ntp.c:341:
+			time_constant = min(time_constant, (long)MAXTC);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#234: FILE: kernel/time/ntp.c:366:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
