the reschedule by increasing the the credited time on

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#102: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:48:
+#define SVM_FEATURE_PAUSE_FILTER (1 << 10)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#147: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2286:
+extern void set_task_delay(struct task_struct *p, unsigned int delay);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#149: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2288:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
