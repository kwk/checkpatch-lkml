#38: 
Now, the last check of refcnt is done after pre_destroy(), so rmdir() can fail

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#117: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:65:
+#define CGROUP_SUBSYS_BUG_ON(cond)	BUG_ON(cond)

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#209: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:600:
+	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&cgrp->css_refcnt)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
