CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/jiffies.h:272:
+extern u64 jiffies_64_to_usecs(const u64 j);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#70: FILE: kernel/time.c:271:
+u64 inline jiffies_64_to_usecs(const u64 j)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
