#30: 
Teach the driver's tuneproc() method to do PIO auto-runing properly since it

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#57: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/aec62xx.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/pci/aec62xx.c		Version 0.21	Apr 21, 2007

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#81: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/aec62xx.c:198:
+	(void) aec62xx_tune_chipset(drive, pio + XFER_PIO_0);
