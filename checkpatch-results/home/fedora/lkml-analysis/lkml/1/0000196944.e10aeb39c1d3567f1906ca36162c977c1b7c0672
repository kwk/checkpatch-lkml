#37: 
Currently, mem_cgroup doesn't have own lock and almost its member doesn't need.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'explict' may be misspelled - perhaps 'explicit'?
#41: 
However, there is one explict exception. mem_cgroup->prev_priorit need lock,
                      ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#67: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:148:
+	/*

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
