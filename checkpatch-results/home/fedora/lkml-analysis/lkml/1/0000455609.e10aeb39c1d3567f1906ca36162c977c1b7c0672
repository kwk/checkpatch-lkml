# HG changeset patch

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#32: 
IB/ipath - fix driver crash (in interrupt or during unload) after chip reset

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#107: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_init_chip.c:859:
+		struct ipath_portdata *npd;
+		npd = create_portdata0(dd);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#110: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_init_chip.c:862:
+			dd->ipath_pd[0] = pd = npd;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#113: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_init_chip.c:865:
+			ipath_dev_err(dd, "Unable to allocate portdata for"
+				      "  port 0, failing\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
