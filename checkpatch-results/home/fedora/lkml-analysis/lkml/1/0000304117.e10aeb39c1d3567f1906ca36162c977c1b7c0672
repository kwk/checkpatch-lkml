Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#64: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:79:
__LINE__); md_print_devices(); }

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#73: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:2850:
+        return sprintf(page, "%d\n", mddev->parallel_resync);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#80: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:2857:
+	unsigned long n = simple_strtoul(buf, &e, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#87: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:2864:
+	if (mddev->sync_thread) {
+		wake_up(&resync_wait);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

+__ATTR(sync_force_parallel, S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR,
                                    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#95: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:2872:
+__ATTR(sync_force_parallel, S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
