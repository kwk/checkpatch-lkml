ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#88: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-core.c:658:
+	if (!(parser = vmalloc(sizeof(struct hid_parser)))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer vmalloc(sizeof(*parser)...) over vmalloc(sizeof(struct hid_parser)...)
#88: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-core.c:658:
+	if (!(parser = vmalloc(sizeof(struct hid_parser)))) {

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
