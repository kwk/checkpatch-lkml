ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#56: FILE: fs/reiserfs/inode.c:1938:
	reiserfs_check_path(&path_to_key);

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Propogate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Propagate'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#67: FILE: fs/reiserfs/namei.c:362:
+		 * in the priv tree */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
