CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*hpc.env)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct kobj_uevent_env)...)
#228: FILE: mm/memory-failure.c:490:
+	hpc.env = kzalloc(sizeof(struct kobj_uevent_env), GFP_NOIO);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#230: FILE: mm/memory-failure.c:492:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "MCE %#lx: out of memory: Failed\n", pfn);

WARNING:OOM_MESSAGE: Possible unnecessary 'out of memory' message
#230: FILE: mm/memory-failure.c:492:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
