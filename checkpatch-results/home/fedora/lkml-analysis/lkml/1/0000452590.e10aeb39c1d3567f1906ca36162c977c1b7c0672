WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'size_t' should also have an identifier name
#72: FILE: include/linux/hugetlb.h:166:
+struct file *hugetlb_file_setup(size_t, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#81: FILE: include/linux/hugetlb.h:188:
+#define hugetlb_file_setup(size, resv)	ERR_PTR(-ENOSYS)

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
