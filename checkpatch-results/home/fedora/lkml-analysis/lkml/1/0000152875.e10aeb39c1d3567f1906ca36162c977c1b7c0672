WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#52: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'vesion' may be misspelled - perhaps 'version'?
#59: FILE: arch/microblaze/Makefile:3:
+# What CPU vesion are we building for, and crack it open
            ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'multipler' may be misspelled - perhaps 'multiplier'?
#70: FILE: arch/microblaze/Makefile:14:
+# Work out HW multipler support.  This is icky.
               ^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'multiplers' may be misspelled - perhaps 'multipliers'?
#71: FILE: arch/microblaze/Makefile:15:
+# 1. Spartan2 has no HW multiplers.
                         ^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'heirarchy' may be misspelled - perhaps 'hierarchy'?
#78: FILE: arch/microblaze/Makefile:22:
+    # USE_HW_MUL can be 0, 1, or 2, defining a heirarchy of HW Mul support.
                                                ^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#133: FILE: arch/microblaze/boot/Makefile:2:
+# arch/microblaze/boot/Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_VARIABLE: Use of EXTRA_CFLAGS is deprecated, please use `ccflags-y instead.
#184: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/Makefile:5:
+EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DCPU_MAJOR=$(CPU_MAJOR) -DCPU_MINOR=$(CPU_MINOR) \

EXTRA_{A,C,CPP,LD}FLAGS are deprecated and should be replaced by the new
flags added via commit f77bf01425b1 ("kbuild: introduce ccflags-y,
asflags-y and ldflags-y").

The following conversion scheme maybe used::

  EXTRA_AFLAGS    ->  asflags-y
  EXTRA_CFLAGS    ->  ccflags-y
  EXTRA_CPPFLAGS  ->  cppflags-y
  EXTRA_LDFLAGS   ->  ldflags-y

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#206: FILE: arch/microblaze/lib/Makefile:13:
+lib-y +=  uaccess.o $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
