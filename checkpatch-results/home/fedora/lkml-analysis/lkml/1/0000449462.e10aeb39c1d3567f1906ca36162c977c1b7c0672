PCI drivers have the new_id file in sysfs which allows new IDs to be added at

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dynid)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pcmcia_dynid)...)
#83: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/ds.c:268:
+	dynid = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pcmcia_dynid), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0200'.
#109: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/ds.c:294:
+static DRIVER_ATTR(new_id, S_IWUSR, NULL, pcmcia_store_new_id);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#128: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/ds.c:313:
+	int error = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "drv->probe"
#128: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/ds.c:313:
+	if (drv->probe != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
