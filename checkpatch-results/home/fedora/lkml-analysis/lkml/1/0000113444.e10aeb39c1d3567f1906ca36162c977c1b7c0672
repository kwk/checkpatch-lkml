#35: 
from which LRU "cursor" page came from. Then, putback it to "src" list is BUG.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#57: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:945:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#57: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:945:
+				/* Do nothing because we don't know where

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting
