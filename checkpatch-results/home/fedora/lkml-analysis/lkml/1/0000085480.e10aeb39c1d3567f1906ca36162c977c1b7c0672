#30: 
Currently, we have "swap discard" mechanism which sends a discard bio request

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

+extern void set_swap_free_notify(unsigned, swap_free_notify_fn *);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#88: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:302:
+extern void set_swap_free_notify(unsigned, swap_free_notify_fn *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned' should also have an identifier name
#88: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:302:
+extern void set_swap_free_notify(unsigned, swap_free_notify_fn *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'swap_free_notify_fn *' should also have an identifier name
#88: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:302:
+extern void set_swap_free_notify(unsigned, swap_free_notify_fn *);

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#104: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:559:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#107: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:562:
+	struct swap_info_struct *sis;
+	sis = get_swap_info_struct(type);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#108: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:563:
+	BUG_ON(!sis);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
