CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#95: FILE: block/blk-core.c:949:
+	if (time_before(rq->start_time + wait_for, jiffies)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#96: FILE: block/blk-core.c:950:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: timing out command, waited %lus\n",

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#98: FILE: block/blk-core.c:952:
+		       wait_for/HZ);
 		               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
