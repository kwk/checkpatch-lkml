Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#76: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:184:
+#define DCACHE_FSNOTIFY_PARENT_WATCHED	0x0040 /* Parent inode is watched by some fsnotify listener */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#170: FILE: include/linux/fsnotify.h:98:
+	 * specifies these are events which came from a child. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
