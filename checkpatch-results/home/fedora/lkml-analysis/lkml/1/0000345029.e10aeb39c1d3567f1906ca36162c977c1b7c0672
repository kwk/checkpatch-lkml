WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#48: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:1346:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "%s: confused, missing data\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#49: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:1347:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "%s: confused, missing data\n",
+					drive->name);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'cdrom_newpc_intr', this function's name, in a string
#51: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:1349:
+					      ? "cdrom_newpc_intr, write"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'cdrom_newpc_intr', this function's name, in a string
#52: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:1350:
+					      : "cdrom_newpc_intr, read");
