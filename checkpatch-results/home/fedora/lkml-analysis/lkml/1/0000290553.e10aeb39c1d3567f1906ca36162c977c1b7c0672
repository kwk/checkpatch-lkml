in the PI chain, it will boost all the readers if they are of lower priority

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#251: FILE: kernel/rtmutex.c:1896:
+	if (rt_mutex_has_waiters(lock)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
