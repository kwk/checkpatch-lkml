WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#161: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:181:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#308: FILE: kernel/power/power.h:29:
+extern int hibernation_snapshot(int platform_mode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
