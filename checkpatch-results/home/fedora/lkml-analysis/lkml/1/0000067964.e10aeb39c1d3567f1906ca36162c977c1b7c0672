Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:ARRAY_SIZE: Prefer ARRAY_SIZE(raid_label)
#53: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:262:
+#define RAID_UNKNOWN (sizeof(raid_label) / sizeof(raid_label[0])-1)

The ARRAY_SIZE(foo) macro should be preferred over
sizeof(foo)/sizeof(foo[0]) for finding number of elements in an
array.

The macro is defined in include/linux/kernel.h::

  #define ARRAY_SIZE(x) (sizeof(x) / sizeof((x)[0]))

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
