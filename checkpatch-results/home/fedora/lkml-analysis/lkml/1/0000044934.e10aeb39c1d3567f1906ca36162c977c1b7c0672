WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#109: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/sa1111_generic.c:125:

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#126: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/sa1111_generic.c:142:
+		if (ret == 0) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
