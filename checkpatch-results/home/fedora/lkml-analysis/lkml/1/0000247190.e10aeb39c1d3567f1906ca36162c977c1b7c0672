WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#69: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/vmi_32.c:414:
+static void vmi_allocate_pmd_clone(unsigned long pfn, unsigned long clonepfn, unsigned long start, unsigned long count)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
