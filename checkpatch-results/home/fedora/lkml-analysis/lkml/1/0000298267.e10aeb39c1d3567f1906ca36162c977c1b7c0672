CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#117: FILE: include/asm-x86/gart.h:8:
+extern int agp_amd64_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#130: FILE: include/asm-x86/gart.h:40:
+#define GARTEN		(1<<0)
               		  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#130: FILE: include/asm-x86/gart.h:40:
+#define GARTEN		(1<<0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
