WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#49: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#188: FILE: arch/score/Kconfig:135:
+source "arch/score/Kconfig.debug"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'debuging' may be misspelled - perhaps 'debugging'?
#233: FILE: arch/score/Kconfig.debug:33:
+	  include/asm-score/debug.h for debuging macros.
