WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#93: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:220:
+extern int pci_iov_bus_range(struct pci_bus *bus);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#101: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:238:
 }
+static inline int pci_iov_bus_range(struct pci_bus *bus)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
