#38: 
This patch fixes issues reported by Mark Brown in his review of National Semiconductors LP3971

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#57: FILE: drivers/regulator/lp3971.c:36:
+/* System control register 1 initial value,
+   bits 4 and 5 are EPROM programmable */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#122: FILE: drivers/regulator/lp3971.c:248:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
