CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!strchr"
#96: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:1168:
+	if (strchr(dev_name(dev), '!') == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#136: FILE: include/linux/device.h:493:
+extern const char *device_get_nodename(struct device *dev, const char **tmp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
