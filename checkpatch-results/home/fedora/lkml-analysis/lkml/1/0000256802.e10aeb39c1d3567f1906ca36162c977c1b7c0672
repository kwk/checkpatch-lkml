WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#82: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/file.c:195:
+		BUG_ON(!(crypt_stat->flags & ECRYPTFS_DELAY_PERSISTENT));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
