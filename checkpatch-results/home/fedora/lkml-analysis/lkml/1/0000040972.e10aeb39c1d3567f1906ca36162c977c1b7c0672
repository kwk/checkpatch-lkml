CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#129: FILE: kernel/futex.c:358:
+	ret = get_user_pages(current, current->mm, (unsigned long)uaddr,
 				 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#184: FILE: kernel/futex.c:2454:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#299: FILE: include/linux/futex.h:218:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
