WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#211: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1371:
+	cpuset_filetype_t type = cft->private;
+	switch (type) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_BREAK: break is not useful after a return
#224: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1384:
+		return fmeter_getrate(&cs->fmeter);
+		break;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#230: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1390:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
