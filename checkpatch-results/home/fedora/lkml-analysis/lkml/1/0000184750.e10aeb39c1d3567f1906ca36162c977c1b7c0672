CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#146: FILE: drivers/pci/dmar.c:884:
+		BUG_ON(addr & ((1 << (VTD_PAGE_SHIFT + mask)) - 1));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#172: FILE: include/linux/intel-iommu.h:199:
+#define DMA_FSTS_ICE (1 << 5)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#204: FILE: include/linux/intel-iommu.h:342:
+extern int qi_flush_dev_iotlb(struct intel_iommu *iommu, u16 sid, int qdep,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
