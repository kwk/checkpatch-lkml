CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#124: FILE: block/blk-core.c:2008:
+		rq->nr_sectors = rq->hard_nr_sectors = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#143: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:676:
+extern void blk_update_request(struct request *rq, int error,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
