CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#108: FILE: include/linux/hash.h:88:
+	return (unsigned int) hash;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#116: FILE: include/linux/hash.h:96:
+	unsigned long hash = init_name_hash();
+	while (len--)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
