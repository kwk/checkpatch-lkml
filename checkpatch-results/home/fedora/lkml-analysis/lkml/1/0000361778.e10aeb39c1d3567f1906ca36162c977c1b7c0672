Subject: [PATCH 4/10] 9p: tranport interface changes for in-kernel server
                          ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct p9_trans_listener *' should also have an identifier name
#90: FILE: include/net/9p/transport.h:81:
+	void (*newtrans)(struct p9_trans_listener *, struct p9_trans *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct p9_trans *' should also have an identifier name
#90: FILE: include/net/9p/transport.h:81:
+	void (*newtrans)(struct p9_trans_listener *, struct p9_trans *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct p9_trans_listener *' should also have an identifier name
