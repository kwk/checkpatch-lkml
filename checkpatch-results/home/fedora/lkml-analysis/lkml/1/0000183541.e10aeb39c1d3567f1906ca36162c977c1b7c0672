WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#598: FILE: fs/dlm/debug_fs.c:389:
+static struct seq_operations format1_seq_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
