Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#125: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc.h:69:
+	BUG_ON((unsigned long)pmd & (PAGE_SIZE-1));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#129: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc.h:73:
+extern void __pmd_free_tlb(struct mmu_gather *tlb, pmd_t *pmd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
