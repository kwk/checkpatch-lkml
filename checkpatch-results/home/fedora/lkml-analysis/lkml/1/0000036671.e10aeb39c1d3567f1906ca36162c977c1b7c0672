Some case of OOM-Kill is caused by memory shortage in lowmem area. For example,

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#111: FILE: include/linux/mm_types.h:210:
 };
+#define LOWMEM_COUNTER	2

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
