CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#85: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/acpi.h:161:
+extern int acpi_get_nodes(struct bootnode *physnodes);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#174: FILE: arch/x86/mm/srat_64.c:375:
+		e820_register_active_regions(i, nodes[i].start >> PAGE_SHIFT,
+						nodes[i].end >> PAGE_SHIFT);
