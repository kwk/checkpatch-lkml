WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#57: FILE: arch/sparc64/Kconfig.debug:44:
+config IRQSTACKS
+	bool "Use separate kernel stacks when processing interrupts"
+	help
+	  If you say Y here the kernel will use separate kernel stacks
+	  for handling hard and soft interrupts.  This can help avoid
+	  overflowing the process kernel stacks.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of '__ARCH_HAS_DO_SOFTIRQ' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#204: FILE: include/asm-sparc64/irq.h:96:
+#define __ARCH_HAS_DO_SOFTIRQ

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.
