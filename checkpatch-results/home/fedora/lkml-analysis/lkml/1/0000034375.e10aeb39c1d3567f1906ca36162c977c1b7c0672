CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#228: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:375:
+				hw->left = hw->right = hw->middle = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#330: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:503:
+	if (hw->z > 30) input_report_key(dev, BTN_TOUCH, 1);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#331: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:504:
+	if (hw->z < 25) input_report_key(dev, BTN_TOUCH, 0);
