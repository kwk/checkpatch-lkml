WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#19: 
Subject: [Patch 5/5] run drivers/misc/xp through scripts/checkpatch.pl

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#1306: FILE: drivers/misc/xp/xpc.h:957:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
