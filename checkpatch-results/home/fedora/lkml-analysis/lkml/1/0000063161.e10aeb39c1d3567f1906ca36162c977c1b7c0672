#47: 
Add the 3 mins support during the FW boot-up to the driver.  Also add the fix for the 64 bit sense buff error.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#150: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c:1947:
+			if (abs_state == curr_abs_state) {
[...]
 			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
