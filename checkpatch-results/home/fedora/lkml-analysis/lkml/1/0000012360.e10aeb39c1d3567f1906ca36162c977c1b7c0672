CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#84: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/numaq.h:33:
+extern int pci_numaq_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#182: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/x86_init.h:103:
+  * struct x86_init_pci - platform specific pci init functions
+ * @init:			platform specific pci init

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
