WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#69: FILE: include/linux/fsalloc.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#70: FILE: include/linux/fsalloc.h:2:
+ *  include/linux/fsalloc.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#152: FILE: lib/fsalloc.c:45:
+	ator->first = ator->curr = &ator->cached;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#168: FILE: lib/fsalloc.c:61:
+			free_pages((unsigned long) curr, curr->order);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
