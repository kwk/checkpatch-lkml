WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#152: FILE: fs/super.c:618:
+		struct vfsmount *mnt;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#201: FILE: fs/super.c:670:
+		if (retval < 0 && retval != -ENOSYS) {

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#264: FILE: include/linux/mount.h:91:
+extern void lock_mnt_writers(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
