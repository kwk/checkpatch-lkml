#30: 
The algorithm used so far to trace the process with the highest priority requires that no other processes with the same priority are being woken up simultaneously. Otherwise, a process with a lower priority may be picked up for tracing which leads to an erroneously high latency value being recorded.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#138: FILE: kernel/trace/latency_hist.c:349:
+			mp->prio = mp->pid = mp->latency = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('
#218: FILE: kernel/trace/latency_hist.c:719:
+			latency = nsecs_to_usecs(

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#221: FILE: kernel/trace/latency_hist.c:722:
+			latency_hist(WAKEUP_LATENCY_SHAREDPRIO, cpu, latency,
+			    next);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#228: FILE: kernel/trace/latency_hist.c:728:
+	if (!wakeup_sharedprio)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
