WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#55: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#60: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#61: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:2:
+ * arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#83: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:24:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/bug.h> instead of <asm/bug.h>
#84: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:25:
+#include <asm/bug.h>

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "family_string_lookup[i].s"
#95: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:36:
+	for (i = 0; family_string_lookup[i].s != NULL; i++) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cpu_ver_lookup[i].s"
#103: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:44:
+	for (i = 0; cpu_ver_lookup[i].s != NULL; i++) {

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#111: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:52:

WARNING:PREFER_SEQ_PUTS: Prefer seq_puts to seq_printf
#136: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:77:

WARNING:PREFER_SEQ_PUTS: Prefer seq_puts to seq_printf
#143: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:84:

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#156: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:97:
+	return i < NR_CPUS ? (void *) (i + 1) : NULL;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#156: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:97:
+	return i < NR_CPUS ? (void *) (i + 1) : NULL;

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#169: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/mb.c:110:
+struct seq_operations cpuinfo_op = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
