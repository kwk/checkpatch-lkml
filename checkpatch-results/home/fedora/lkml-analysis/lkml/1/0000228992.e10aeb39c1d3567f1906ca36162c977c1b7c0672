WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#188: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic.c:1332:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
