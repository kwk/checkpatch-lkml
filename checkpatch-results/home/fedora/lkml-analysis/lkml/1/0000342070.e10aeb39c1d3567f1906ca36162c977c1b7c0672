WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#19: 
Subject: [PATCH] checkpatch.pl: recognize the #elif preprocessor directive

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.
