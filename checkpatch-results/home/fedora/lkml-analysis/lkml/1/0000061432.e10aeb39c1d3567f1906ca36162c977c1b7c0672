CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Wdesignated_init>
#77: FILE: evaluate.c:2383:
+			if (Wdesignated_init && struct_sym->designated_init)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 131 exceeds 100 columns
#78: FILE: evaluate.c:2384:

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 112 exceeds 100 columns
#154: FILE: parse.c:1136:
+static struct token *attribute_designated_init(struct token *token, struct symbol *attr, struct decl_state *ctx)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
