WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 112 exceeds 100 columns

+					opt_rx->rcv_tsecr = ntohl(get_unaligned((__be32 *)(ptr+4))) - tsecr_off;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
