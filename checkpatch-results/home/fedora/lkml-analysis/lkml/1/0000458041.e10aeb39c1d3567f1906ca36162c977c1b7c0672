WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#63: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2191:
+extern char vt_dont_switch;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#69: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2197:
+^Iif(!vc_cons_allocated(nr) || vt_dont_switch || $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#69: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2197:
+	if(!vc_cons_allocated(nr) || vt_dont_switch || 

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#70: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2198:
+	if(!vc_cons_allocated(nr) || vt_dont_switch || 
+		(vc->vt_mode.mode != VT_PROCESS && vc->vc_mode == KD_GRAPHICS)) {

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#71: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2199:
+		(vc->vt_mode.mode != VT_PROCESS && vc->vc_mode == KD_GRAPHICS)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
