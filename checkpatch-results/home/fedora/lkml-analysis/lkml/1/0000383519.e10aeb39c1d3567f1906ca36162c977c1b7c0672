WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#58: 
# This result is a little different from previous threads, 

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#59: 
# because I changed some kernel configs.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#78: 
I added entries in file_security struct and saving these values at file open.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#112: FILE: security/selinux/avc.c:126:
+u32 policy_seqno = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#135: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:87:
+extern u32 policy_seqno;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#179: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:2504:
+			int rc;
+			AVC_AUDIT_DATA_INIT(&ad, FS);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
