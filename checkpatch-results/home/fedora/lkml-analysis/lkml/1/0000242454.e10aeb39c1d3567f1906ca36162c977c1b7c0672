WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#71: FILE: Makefile:484:
+	$(Q)$(MAKE) -f $(srctree)/Makefile syncconfig

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#246: FILE: scripts/kconfig/conf.c:548:
+					_("\n*** Kernel configuration requires explicit update.\n\n"));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <rootEntry>
#268: FILE: scripts/kconfig/conf.c:573:
+		rootEntry = &rootmenu;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.
