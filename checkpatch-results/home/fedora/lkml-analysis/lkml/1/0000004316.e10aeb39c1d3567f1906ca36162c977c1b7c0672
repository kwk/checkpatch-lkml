CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:326:
+extern void note_threaded_interrupt(unsigned int irq, struct irq_desc *desc,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#54: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:327:
+extern void note_threaded_interrupt(unsigned int irq, struct irq_desc *desc,
+			   irqreturn_t action_ret);
