CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: include/linux/time.h:151:
+extern u64 timekeeping_max_deferment(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#124: FILE: kernel/time/clocksource.c:447:
+	max_cycles = min_t(u64, max_cycles, (u64) cs->mask);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
