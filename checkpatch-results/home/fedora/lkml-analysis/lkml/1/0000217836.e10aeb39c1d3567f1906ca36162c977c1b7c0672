WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#59: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#199: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:299:
+/* Note: Add compiled in defaults to these arrays, not to the structure
+	in ip2.h any longer.  That structure WILL get overridden

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#266: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:554:
+__setup("ip2=", ip2_setup);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#279: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:569:
+		irq[0] = irq[1] = irq[2] = irq[3] = poll_only = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
