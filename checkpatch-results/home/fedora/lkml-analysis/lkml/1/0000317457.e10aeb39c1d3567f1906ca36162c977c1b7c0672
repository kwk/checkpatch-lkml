Subject: [PATCH] capi: fix sparse warnings using integer as NULL pointer

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#95: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capi.c:353:
+			if ((mp = np->minorp) != NULL) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#104: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capi.c:369:
+			if (*pp == NULL) return;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pp"
#104: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capi.c:369:
+			if (*pp == NULL) return;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
