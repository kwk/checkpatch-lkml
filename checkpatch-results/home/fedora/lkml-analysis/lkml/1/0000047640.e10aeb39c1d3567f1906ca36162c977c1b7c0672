Subject: [PATCH 09/13] staging: line6: Lindent and fix some checkpatch warnings in toneport.c

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:EXPORTED_WORLD_WRITABLE: Exporting world writable files is usually an error. Consider more restrictive permissions.
#145: FILE: drivers/staging/line6/toneport.c:115:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(led_red, S_IWUGO | S_IRUGO, line6_nop_read,

Exporting world writable sysfs/debugfs files is usually a bad thing.
When done arbitrarily they can introduce serious security bugs.
In the past, some of the debugfs vulnerabilities would seemingly allow
any local user to write arbitrary values into device registers - a
situation from which little good can be expected to emerge.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IWUGO | S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0666'.
#145: FILE: drivers/staging/line6/toneport.c:115:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(led_red, S_IWUGO | S_IRUGO, line6_nop_read,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:EXPORTED_WORLD_WRITABLE: Exporting world writable files is usually an error. Consider more restrictive permissions.

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_PERMS: DEVICE_ATTR unusual permissions 'S_IWUGO | S_IRUGO' used
#147: FILE: drivers/staging/line6/toneport.c:117:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(led_green, S_IWUGO | S_IRUGO, line6_nop_read,

The permissions used in DEVICE_ATTR are unusual.
Typically only three permissions are used - 0644 (RW), 0444 (RO)
and 0200 (WO).
