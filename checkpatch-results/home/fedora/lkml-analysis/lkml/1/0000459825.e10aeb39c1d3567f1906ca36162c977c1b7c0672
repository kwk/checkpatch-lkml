WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'substring_t *' should also have an identifier name
#57: FILE: include/linux/parser.h:29:
+int match_substring(substring_t *, match_table_t table, substring_t args[]);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#127: FILE: lib/parser.c:273:
+	char *delim = strpbrk(cs, ct);
+	if (delim)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
