CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'prev == NULL'
#101: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:1347:
+	if ((prev == NULL) && !__tcp_write_queue_empty(sk, TCP_WQ_SACKED))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!prev"
#101: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:1347:
+	if ((prev == NULL) && !__tcp_write_queue_empty(sk, TCP_WQ_SACKED))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "prev"
#104: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:1350:
+	if (prev != NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "prev"
#116: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:1477:
+	if (prev != NULL)
