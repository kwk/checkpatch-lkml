#31: 
Add quirks for several AMD/ATI chipsets to prevent generation of legacy boot

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#89: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1441:
+#define AMD_813X_NOIOAMODE		(1<<0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#105: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1457:
+DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_EARLY(PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMD,   PCI_DEVICE_ID_AMD_8131_BRIDGE, 	quirk_disable_amd_813x_boot_interrupt);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
