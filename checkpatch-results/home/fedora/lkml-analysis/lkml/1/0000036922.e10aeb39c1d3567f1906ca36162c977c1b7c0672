WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name
#76: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/syscalls.h:21:
+long sys_iopl(unsigned int, struct pt_regs *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pt_regs *' should also have an identifier name
#76: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/syscalls.h:21:
+long sys_iopl(unsigned int, struct pt_regs *);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#117: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S:735:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#131: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/ioport.c:106:
+long sys_iopl(unsigned int level, struct pt_regs *regs)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
