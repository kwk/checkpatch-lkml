+			panic("userspace - PTRACE_SETREGS failed, "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#53: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/skas/process.c:303:
+			panic("userspace - PTRACE_SETREGS failed, "
+			      "errno = %d\n", errno);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
