WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#63: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#91: FILE: arch/x86/vdso/vma.c:21:
+extern char vdso_start[], vdso_end[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#111: FILE: arch/x86/vdso/vma.c:63:
+	*(typeof(__ ## x) **) var_ref(VDSO64_SYMBOL(vbase, x), #x) = &__ ## x;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.
