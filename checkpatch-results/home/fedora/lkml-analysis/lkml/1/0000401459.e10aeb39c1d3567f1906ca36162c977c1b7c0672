The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#428: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:394:
+			mousedev->packet.dx = mousedev->packet.dy =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#511: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:464:
+			if (mousedev_open_device(mousedev));
+				continue;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
