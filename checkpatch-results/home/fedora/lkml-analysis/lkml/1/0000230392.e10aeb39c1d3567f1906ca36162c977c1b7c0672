WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .17
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#64: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/generic.c:251:
+		tmp |= ~((1<<(hi - 1)) - 1);
 		           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#309: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:72:
+		inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = zerotime;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#311: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:74:
+		/* inode->i_nlink is left 1 - arguably wrong for directories,
+		   but it's the best we can do without reading the directory

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#313: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:76:
+		   without -noleaf option. */

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#327: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:90:
+			init_special_inode(inode, inode->i_mode,
+				old_decode_dev(cramfs_inode->size));

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#362: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4acl.c:446:
+		+ cnt*sizeof(struct posix_user_ace_state);
 		     ^

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#374: FILE: include/linux/fb.h:969:
+extern void fb_deferred_io_open(struct fb_info *info,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#428: FILE: net/sched/sch_prio.c:241:
+				       (struct nlattr *) (qopt + 1), NULL);

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#659: FILE: net/sctp/socket.c:5193:
+	if (put_user(len, optlen)) return -EFAULT;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
