CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <diRead>
#72: FILE: fs/jfs/inode.c:45:
+	ret = diRead(inode);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#97: FILE: fs/jfs/jfs_inode.h:25:
+extern struct inode *jfs_iget(struct super_block *, unsigned long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct super_block *' should also have an identifier name
#97: FILE: fs/jfs/jfs_inode.h:25:
+extern struct inode *jfs_iget(struct super_block *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#97: FILE: fs/jfs/jfs_inode.h:25:
+extern struct inode *jfs_iget(struct super_block *, unsigned long);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!inode"
#181: FILE: fs/jfs/super.c:464:
+	if (inode == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
