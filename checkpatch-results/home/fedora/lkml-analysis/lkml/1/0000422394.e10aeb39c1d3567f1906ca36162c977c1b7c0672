CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#143: FILE: Documentation/lguest/lguest.c:359:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#174: FILE: Documentation/lguest/lguest.c:486:
+			if (now.tv_sec <= abort->start.tv_sec+1) {
 			                                     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#177: FILE: Documentation/lguest/lguest.c:489:
+				u32 args[] = { LHREQ_BREAK, 0 };
+				close(waker_fd);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#228: FILE: Documentation/lguest/lguest.c:904:
+		if (readval == sizeof(arr)) {
[...]
+			continue;
[...]
 			errx(1, "%s", reason);
[...]

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#315: FILE: drivers/lguest/lguest_user.c:35:
+ * Launcher then writes LHREQ_BREAK and "0" to release the Waker. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#330: FILE: drivers/lguest/lguest_user.c:50:
+		return wait_event_interruptible(lg->break_wq, !lg->break_out);
