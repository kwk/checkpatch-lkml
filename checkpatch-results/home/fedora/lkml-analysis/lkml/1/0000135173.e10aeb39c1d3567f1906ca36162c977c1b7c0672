CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: arch/arm/include/asm/ftrace.h:33:
+extern void return_to_handler(void);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#211: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/ftrace.c:113:
+static int push_return_trace(unsigned long ret, unsigned long long time,
+	unsigned long func, int *depth)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
