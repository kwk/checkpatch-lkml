WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#177: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:3141:
+	BUG_ON(var_free_kbytes < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#181: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:3145:
+		struct zone *zone;
+		for_each_zone(zone)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
