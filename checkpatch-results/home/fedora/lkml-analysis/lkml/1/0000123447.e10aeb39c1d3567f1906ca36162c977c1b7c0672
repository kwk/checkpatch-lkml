WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#64: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:295:
+config X86_UPDATE_MPTABLE
+	bool "Enable update mptable according to ACPI"
+	default n
+	depends on X86_MPPARSE && ACPI && KEXEC
+	---help---
+	  Some systems do not have correct mptable. With "update_mptable" or
+	  "alloc_mptable" kernel could try to update mptable according to DSDT.
+	  Then could use kexec to start second kernel (even old) without ACPI
+	  support compiled in or "acpi=off"
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#139: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mpspec.h:90:
+extern void early_reserve_e820_mpc_new(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#145: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mpspec.h:96:
 }
+static inline void early_reserve_e820_mpc_new(void) { }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
