WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#77: FILE: fs/compat_ioctl.c:1891:
+	int ret = -ENOTTY;
+	arg = (unsigned long)compat_ptr(arg);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#79: FILE: fs/compat_ioctl.c:1893:
+	if (file->f_op->unlocked_ioctl)
[...]
+	else if (file->f_op->ioctl) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#102: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1811:
+extern long generic_compat_ioctl(struct file *file, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
#104: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1813:
