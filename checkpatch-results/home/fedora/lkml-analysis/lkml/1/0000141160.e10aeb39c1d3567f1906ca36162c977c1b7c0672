WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#41: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#92: FILE: fs/aufs/dbgaufs.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#113: FILE: fs/aufs/dbgaufs.c:22:
+static const mode_t dbgaufs_mode = S_IRUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH;

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <AuDebugOn>
#159: FILE: fs/aufs/dbgaufs.c:68:
+		AuDebugOn(p->n >= sizeof(p->a));

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#168: FILE: fs/aufs/dbgaufs.c:77:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#221: FILE: fs/aufs/dbgaufs.c:130:
+	err = strict_strtol(name->name + sizeof(DbgaufsXi_PREFIX) - 1, 10, &l);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
