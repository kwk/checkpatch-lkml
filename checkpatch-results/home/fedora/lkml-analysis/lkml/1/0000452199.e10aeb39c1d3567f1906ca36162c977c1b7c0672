CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#73: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c:351:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#82: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c:360:
+			switch(fsid_type) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that '!' (ctx:BxW)

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#98: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c:376:
+				/* fall through */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!exp->ex_uuid"
#101: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c:379:
+				if (exp->ex_uuid == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
