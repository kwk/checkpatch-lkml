CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#146: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-report.c:140:
+	if (!field_sep)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#150: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-report.c:144:
+		char *bf = NULL;
+		n = vasprintf(&bf, fmt, ap);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sep"
#155: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-report.c:149:
+				if (sep == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct hist_entry *' should also have an identifier name
#205: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-report.c:584:
+	size_t	(*print)(FILE *fp, struct hist_entry *, unsigned int width);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
