#133: FILE: include/linux/skbuff.h:1515:
+extern void __netdev_free_page(struct net_device *dev, struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+			skb_frag_t *frag = &skb_shinfo(skb)->frags[i];
+			skb_shinfo(n)->frags[i] = *frag;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
