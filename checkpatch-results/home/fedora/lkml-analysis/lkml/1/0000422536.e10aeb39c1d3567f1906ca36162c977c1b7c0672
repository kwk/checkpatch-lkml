 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#101: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:175:
+^I       ^Ip->tgid, p->pid,$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#101: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:175:
+^I       ^Ip->tgid, p->pid,$

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#102: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:176:
+^I       ^Ipid_alive(p) ? rcu_dereference(p->real_parent)->tgid : 0,$

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#196: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1230:
+	p->wait_start_fair = p->wait_start = p->exec_start = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
