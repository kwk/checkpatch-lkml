CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#63: FILE: arch/x86/mach-generic/es7000.c:58:
+		if (check_dsdt)
[...]
 		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#88: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/es7000_32.c:112:
+extern void unmap_unisys_acpi_oem_table(unsigned long oem_addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
