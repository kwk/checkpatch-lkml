WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#110: FILE: fs/signalfd.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#111: FILE: fs/signalfd.c:2:
+ *  fs/signalfd.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'strcture' may be misspelled - perhaps 'structure'?
#116: FILE: fs/signalfd.c:7:
+ *      Changed ->read() to return a siginfo strcture instead of signal number.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#138: FILE: fs/signalfd.c:29:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "lk->tsk"
#166: FILE: fs/signalfd.c:57:
+	if (likely(lk->tsk != NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "sighand"
#175: FILE: fs/signalfd.c:66:
+	return sighand != NULL;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#191: FILE: fs/signalfd.c:82:
+	BUG_ON(!sig);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#246: FILE: fs/signalfd.c:137:
+	if (signalfd_lock(ctx, &lk)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#756: FILE: include/linux/signal.h:236:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
