CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern void set_dumpable(struct mm_struct *mm, int value);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
