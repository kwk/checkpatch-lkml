> BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at net/core/sock.c:1523

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#86: FILE: net/bluetooth/hci_sock.c:659:
+			if (in_atomic())

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.
