CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/linux/bootmem.h:97:
+extern int reserve_bootmem_node(pg_data_t *pgdat,

files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#69: FILE: include/linux/bootmem.h:98:
+extern int reserve_bootmem_node(pg_data_t *pgdat,
 				 unsigned long physaddr,
