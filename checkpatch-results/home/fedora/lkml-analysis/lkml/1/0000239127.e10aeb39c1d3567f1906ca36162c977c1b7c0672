CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#195: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ath9k/hw.c:5020:
 		if ((cur_vit_mask > lower) && (cur_vit_mask < upper)) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#197: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ath9k/hw.c:5022:
+			volatile int tmp = abs(cur_vit_mask - bin);

CHECK:SPACING: space preferred before that '+' (ctx:VxE)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*priv->cached_vdcf)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct p54_tx_control_vdcf)...)
#538: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/p54/p54common.c:841:
+		priv->cached_vdcf = kzalloc(sizeof(struct p54_tx_control_vdcf)+

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
