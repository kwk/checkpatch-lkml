CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*svm_data)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct svm_cpu_data)...)
#79: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:276:
+	svm_data = kzalloc(sizeof(struct svm_cpu_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#96: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:293:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition

+	if ((ret = svm_cpu_init(me)) != 0) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#113: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:327:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "svm_hardware_enable: svm_cpu_init failed on %d with status: %d\n", me, ret);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
