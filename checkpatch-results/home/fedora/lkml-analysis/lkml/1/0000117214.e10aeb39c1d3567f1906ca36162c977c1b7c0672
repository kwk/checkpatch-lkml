CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:811:
+extern void revoke_file_mappings(struct file *file);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#102: FILE: mm/memory.c:2367:
+static struct vm_operations_struct revoked_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
