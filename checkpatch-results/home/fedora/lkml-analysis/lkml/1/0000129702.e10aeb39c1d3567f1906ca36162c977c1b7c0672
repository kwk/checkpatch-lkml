WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after intel_no_lvds[]
#85: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_lvds.c:394:
+static const struct dmi_system_id __initdata intel_no_lvds[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of const init definition must use __initconst
#85: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_lvds.c:394:
+static const struct dmi_system_id __initdata intel_no_lvds[] = {

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.
