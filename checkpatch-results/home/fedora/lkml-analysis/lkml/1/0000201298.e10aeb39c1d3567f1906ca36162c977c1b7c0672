CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:98:
+extern bool mem_cgroup_oom_called(struct task_struct *task);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#77: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:232:
 }
+static inline bool mem_cgroup_oom_called(struct task_struct *task);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
