Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*kvm)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct kvm)...)
#146: FILE: drivers/kvm/x86.c:2549:
+	struct kvm *kvm = kzalloc(sizeof(struct kvm), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#180: FILE: drivers/kvm/x86.c:2583:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
