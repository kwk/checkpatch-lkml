WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#52: FILE: drivers/rtc/Kconfig:297:
+config RTC_DRV_M41T80_WDT
+	bool "ST M41T80 series RTC watchdog timer"
+	depends on RTC_DRV_M41T80
+	help
+	  If you say Y here you will get support for the
+	  watchdog timer in ST M41T80 RTC chips series.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'mulitplier' may be misspelled - perhaps 'multiplier'?
#127: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-m41t80.c:464:
+		 * WDS = 1 (0x80), mulitplier = WD_TIMO, resolution = 1s (0x02)
 		                   ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#129: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-m41t80.c:466:
+		i2c_data[1] = wdt_margin<<2 | 0x82;
 		                        ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'we'
#181: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-m41t80.c:518:
+ *	write of data will do, as we we don't define content meaning.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#187: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-m41t80.c:524:
+	/*  Can't seek (pwrite) on this device
+	if (ppos != &file->f_pos)

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
