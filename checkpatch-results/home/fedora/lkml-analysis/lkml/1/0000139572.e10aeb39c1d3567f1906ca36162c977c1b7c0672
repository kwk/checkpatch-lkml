#51: 
Note, this change alone does not permit modules to use the TRACE_EVENT macros,

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#257: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_events.c:803:
+extern struct ftrace_event_call __stop_ftrace_events[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'event' - possible side-effects?
#259: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_events.c:805:
+#define for_each_event(event)						\
+	for (event = __start_ftrace_events;				\
+	     (unsigned long)event < (unsigned long)__stop_ftrace_events; \
+	     event++)
