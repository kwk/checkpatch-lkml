Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#269: FILE: include/asm-x86/vmi_time.h:53:
+extern unsigned long vmi_tsc_khz(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#272: FILE: include/asm-x86/vmi_time.h:56:
