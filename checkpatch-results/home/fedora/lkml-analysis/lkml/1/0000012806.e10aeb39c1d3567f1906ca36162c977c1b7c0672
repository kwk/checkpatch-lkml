#50: 
we can't really say by the xsave header wether a state is in init state or
                                        ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#106: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/user.h:1:
+#ifndef _ASM_X86_USER_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#181: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/xsave.h:34:
+extern void update_regset_xstate_info(unsigned int size, u64 xstate_mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'capabilites' may be misspelled - perhaps 'capabilities'?
#196: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/i387.c:170:
+ * capabilites supported by the xsave.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#278: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/i387.c:305:
+	xsave_hdr->reserved1[0] = xsave_hdr->reserved1[1] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
