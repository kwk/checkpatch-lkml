Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'snd_usb_caiaq_midi_send', this function's name, in a string
#812: FILE: sound/usb/caiaq/caiaq-midi.c:88:
+		log("snd_usb_caiaq_midi_send(%p): usb_submit_urb() failed,"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#813: FILE: sound/usb/caiaq/caiaq-midi.c:89:
+		log("snd_usb_caiaq_midi_send(%p): usb_submit_urb() failed,"
+		    "ret=%d, len=%d\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
