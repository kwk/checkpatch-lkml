CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#89: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:791:
+	while (level > 0) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#140: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:879:
+	BUG_ON(!is_power_of_2(page_size));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
