CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#98: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:403:
+extern void tasklet_init_key(struct tasklet_struct *t,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable

+EXPORT_SYMBOL(tasklet_init_key);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
