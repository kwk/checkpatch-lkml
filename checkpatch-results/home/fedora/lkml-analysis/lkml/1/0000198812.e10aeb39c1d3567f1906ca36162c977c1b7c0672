WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'cpcmd', this function's name, in a string
#57: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/cpcmd.c:110:
+			pr_warning("The cpcmd kernel function failed to "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#58: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/cpcmd.c:111:
+			pr_warning("The cpcmd kernel function failed to "
+				   "allocate a response buffer\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
