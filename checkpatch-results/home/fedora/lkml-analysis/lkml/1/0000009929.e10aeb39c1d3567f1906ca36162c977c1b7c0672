#14: 
Subject: [PATCH 02/12] Update kenel audit range comments to show AppArmor's registered range of 1500-1599.  This range used to be reserved for LSPP but LSPP uses the SELinux range and the range was given to AppArmor. Patch is not in mainline -- pending AppArmor code submission to lkml

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
