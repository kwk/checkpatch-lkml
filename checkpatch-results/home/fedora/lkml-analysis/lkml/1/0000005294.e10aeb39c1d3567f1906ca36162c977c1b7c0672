Subject: [PATCH] staging/dt3155: sparse cleanup of allocator code

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*newptr)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct allocator_struct)...)
#93: FILE: drivers/staging/dt3155/allocator.c:152:
+	newptr = kmalloc(sizeof(struct allocator_struct), flags);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
