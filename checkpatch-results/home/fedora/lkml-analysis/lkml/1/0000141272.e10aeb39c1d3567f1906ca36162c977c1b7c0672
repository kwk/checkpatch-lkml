#40: 
I argue that nsproxy should be removed totally, if someone thinks otherwise. ;-)

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#129: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 120 exceeds 100 columns
#172: FILE: kernel/cr/cr-nsproxy.c:40:
+			printk("%s: nsproxy %p has external references %lu:%u\n", __func__, nsproxy, obj->o_count, cnt);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
