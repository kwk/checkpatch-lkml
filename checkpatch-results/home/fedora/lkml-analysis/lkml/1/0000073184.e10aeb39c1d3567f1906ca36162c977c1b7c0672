CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#172: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-stat.c:474:
+	cleanup = cleanup_argc = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#173: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-stat.c:475:
+	for (j = 1; j < (argc-1); j ++) {
 	                     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }
