#36: 
Subject: x86, microcode_amd: cleanup, mark request_microcode_user() as unsupported

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#88: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode_amd.c:343:
+		unsigned int uninitialized_var(mc_size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'mc_size' should also have an identifier name
#88: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode_amd.c:343:
+		unsigned int uninitialized_var(mc_size);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
