CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!firmware"
#88: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode_amd.c:308:
+	if (firmware == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#110: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode_amd.c:341:
+	const char *fw_name = "amd-ucode/microcode_amd.bin";
+	if (request_firmware(&firmware, fw_name, device))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
