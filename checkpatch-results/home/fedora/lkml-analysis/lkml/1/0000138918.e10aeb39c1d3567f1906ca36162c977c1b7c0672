WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#109: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#114: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/cpuid.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:NEW_TYPEDEFS: do not add new typedefs

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#131: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/cpuid.h:18:
+typedef struct
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#323: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/thread_info.h:36:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#335: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/timer.h:44:
+extern int mod_virt_timer_periodic(struct vtimer_list *timer, __u64 expires);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'synchonization' may be misspelled - perhaps 'synchronization'?
#811: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/time.c:1609:
+		 * There is a usable clock but the synchonization failed.
 		                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#889: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/vtime.c:463:
+	BUG_ON(timer->cpu != cpu);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#1004: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd.c:2166:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#1006: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd.c:2168:
+		struct dasd_device *device = dasd_device_from_cdev(cdev);
+		wait_event(dasd_init_waitq, _wait_for_device(device));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
