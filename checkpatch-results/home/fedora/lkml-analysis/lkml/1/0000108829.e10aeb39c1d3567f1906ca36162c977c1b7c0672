This can be handled in simliar manner to the x86_64 highmap alias.
                       ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#127: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup_percpu.c:239:
+				struct pcpul_ent tmp = pcpul_map[i];
+				pcpul_map[i] = pcpul_map[j];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#175: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup_percpu.c:284:
+		if (pcpul_map[pos].ptr < pmd_addr)
[...]
+		else if (pcpul_map[pos].ptr > pmd_addr)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
