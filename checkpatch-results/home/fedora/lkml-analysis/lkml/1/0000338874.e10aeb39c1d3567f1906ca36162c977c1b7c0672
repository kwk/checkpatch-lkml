#29: 
Eleminiate task queuing of iwl_pci_probe, register hw to ieee80211 immediately

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#90: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl3945-base.c:6879:
+	ret = wait_event_interruptible_timeout(priv->wait_command_queue,
+			iwl_is_ready(priv), HOST_COMPLETE_TIMEOUT);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#92: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl3945-base.c:6881:
+	if (ret == -ERESTARTSYS)
[...]
+	else if (ret == 0 && !iwl_is_ready(priv)) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#109: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl3945-base.c:8299:
+	int err;
+	IWL_DEBUG_INFO("register_hw\n");

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#140: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl3945-base.c:8569:
+		IWL_ERROR("Failed to register network "
+			  "device (error %d)\n", err);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
