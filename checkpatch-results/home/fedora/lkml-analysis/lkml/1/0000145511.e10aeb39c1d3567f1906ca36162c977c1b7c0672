Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#288: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.h:851:
+extern int filter_match_preds(struct filter_pred **preds, void *rec);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
