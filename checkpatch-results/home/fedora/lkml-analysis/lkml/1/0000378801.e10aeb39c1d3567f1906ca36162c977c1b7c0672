ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#52: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/gpio_keys.c:76:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#67: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/gpio_keys.c:86:
+				     IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM | IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING | IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING,

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
