ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo __read_mostly	bar" should be "foo __read_mostly bar"
#126: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:398:
+unsigned long __read_mostly	tracing_max_latency;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
