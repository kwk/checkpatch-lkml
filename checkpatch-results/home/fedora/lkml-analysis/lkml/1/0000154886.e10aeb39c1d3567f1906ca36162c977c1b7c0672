WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#136: FILE: fs/jbd2/transaction.c:2084:
+	 * a transaction adding the inode to orphan list */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
