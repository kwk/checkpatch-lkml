### Comments for Changeset

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix '.' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'chunk_aligned_read', this function's name, in a string
#52: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:2633:
+		PRINTK("chunk_aligned_read : non aligned\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
