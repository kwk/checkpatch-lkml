#30: 
Instead of just adding another one to the task struct I combined them all into

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!task->blocked_on"
#155: FILE: kernel/mutex-debug.c:78:
+	DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(task->blocked_on == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
