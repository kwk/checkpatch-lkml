#31: 
The SCLP base driver defines a new notifier call back for all upper level SCLP

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#298: FILE: drivers/s390/char/sclp.c:1022:
+static struct dev_pm_ops sclp_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct sclp_register *' should also have an identifier name
#473: FILE: drivers/s390/char/sclp.h:145:
+	void (*pm_event_fn)(struct sclp_register *, enum sclp_pm_event);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
