WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#49: FILE: Makefile:476:
+	$(Q)$(MAKE) -f $(srctree)/Makefile oldconfig

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
