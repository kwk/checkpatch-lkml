+		  printk(KERN_WARNING "ub_end_rq: __blk_end_request failed "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ub_end_rq', this function's name, in a string
#86: FILE: drivers/block/ub.c:821:
+		  printk(KERN_WARNING "ub_end_rq: __blk_end_request failed "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#87: FILE: drivers/block/ub.c:822:
+		  printk(KERN_WARNING "ub_end_rq: __blk_end_request failed "
+			 "with size %i\n", size);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
