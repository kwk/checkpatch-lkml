CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#203: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv.h:138:
+extern int pcie_aer_get_firmware_first(struct pci_dev *pci_dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#239: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv_acpi.c:62:
+	return	(0           == pci_domain_nr(pci->bus) &&

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#278: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv_acpi.c:101:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
