#56: 
Subject: [PATCH] Attempt to introduce common MFD driver for MSP430 microprocessor support.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#82: FILE: drivers/mfd/Kconfig:38:
+config MFD_DAVINCI_MSP
+	bool "DaVinci MSP430 microcontroller"
+	depends on I2C && (MACH_DAVINCI_DM355_EVM || MACH_NEUROS_OSD2)
 	help
 	  This driver supports the MSP430 microcontroller used on these
 	  boards.  MSP430 firmware manages resets and power sequencing,
+	  inputs from buttons and the IR remote, LEDs, an RTC, and more
+	  inputs from buttons and the IR remote, LEDs, an RTC, and more
+	  (full set of features depends on particular board).
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
