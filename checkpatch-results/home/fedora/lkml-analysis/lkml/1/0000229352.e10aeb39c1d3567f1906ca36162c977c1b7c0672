Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#111: FILE: drivers/mfd/wm8400-core.c:28:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!msg"
#437: FILE: drivers/mfd/wm8400-core.c:354:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*wm8400)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct wm8400)...)
#461: FILE: drivers/mfd/wm8400-core.c:378:
+	wm8400 = kzalloc(sizeof(struct wm8400), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
