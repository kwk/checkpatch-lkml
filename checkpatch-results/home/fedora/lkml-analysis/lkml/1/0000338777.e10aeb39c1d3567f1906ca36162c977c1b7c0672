> That's just iterating what's already been said. My claim is that 4-bit is 4-bit, regardless if it's MMC or SD. So if you want this patch to go in you need to explain why there is a difference for the blackfin controller.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#67: 
--- a/drivers/mmc/core/mmc.c

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
