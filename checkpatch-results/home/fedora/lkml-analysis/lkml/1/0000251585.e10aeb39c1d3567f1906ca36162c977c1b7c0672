Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#196: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:81:
+extern void rebuild_sched_domains(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'becuase' may be misspelled - perhaps 'because'?

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead
#312: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:312:
+	synchronize_sched();

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

 	if (!cpu_isset(dest_cpu, p->cpus_allowed)

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after ints[NR_CPUS]
#723: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6689:
+	static int __initdata ints[NR_CPUS];

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!doms_new"
#766: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7566:
+	if (doms_new == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
