WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#273: FILE: drivers/net/netconsole.c:379:
+static struct file_operations miscdev_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
