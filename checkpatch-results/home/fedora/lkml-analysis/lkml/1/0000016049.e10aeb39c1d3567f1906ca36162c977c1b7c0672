#93: FILE: include/linux/hid.h:504:
+	int (*hid_output_raw_report) (struct hid_device *, __u8 *, size_t, unsigned char);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
