Subject: [PATCH] ide: add support for arbitrary transfer lengths to ide_pio_bytes()

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cursg"
#68: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:205:
+	if (cursg == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#69: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:206:
+		cursg = cmd->cursg = sg;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#72: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:209:
+		unsigned nr_bytes = min(len, cursg->length - cmd->cursg_ofs);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#106: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:230:
+			cursg = cmd->cursg = sg_next(cmd->cursg);

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#154: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:265:
+		nr_bytes = min_t(unsigned, cmd->nleft, drive->mult_count << 9);
