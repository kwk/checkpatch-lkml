WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+	  This tracer does nothing. The primary purpose for it is to
+	  politely print the output of ftrace_printk() calls without
+	  the overhead of an irrelevant trace taking place.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.h:343:
+extern int trace_selftest_startup_nop(struct tracer *trace,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#82: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.h:344:
+extern int trace_selftest_startup_nop(struct tracer *trace,
+					 struct trace_array *tr);

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
