CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!memchr"
#59: FILE: fs/ext2/symlink.c:29:
+	if (memchr(ei->i_data, 0, sizeof(ei->i_data)) == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#62: FILE: fs/ext2/symlink.c:32:
+		nd_set_link(nd, (char *)ei->i_data);

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
