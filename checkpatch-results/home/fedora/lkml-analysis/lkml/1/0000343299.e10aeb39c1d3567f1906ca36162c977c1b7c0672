CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#86: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm.h:670:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#388: FILE: drivers/kvm/x86.c:2364:
+struct kvm_vcpu *kvm_arch_vcpu_create(struct kvm *kvm,
+						unsigned int id)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#399: FILE: drivers/kvm/x86.c:2375:
+	BUG_ON((unsigned long)&vcpu->host_fx_image & 0xF);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#461: FILE: drivers/kvm/x86.c:2437:
+	BUG_ON(vcpu->kvm == NULL);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vcpu->kvm"
#461: FILE: drivers/kvm/x86.c:2437:
+	BUG_ON(vcpu->kvm == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
