The email format for stable is incorrect.
Some valid options for stable address are::

  1. stable@vger.kernel.org
  2. stable@kernel.org

For adding version info, the following comment style should be used::

  stable@vger.kernel.org # version info

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#124: FILE: arch/i386/xen/enlighten.c:667:
+	/* Update while interrupts are disabled, so its atomic with
+	   respect to ipis */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
