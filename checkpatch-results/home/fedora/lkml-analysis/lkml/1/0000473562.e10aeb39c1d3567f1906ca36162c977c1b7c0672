with dynticks and highres_timers enabled, cpufreq_ondemand makes mess here on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#59: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c:376:
+			printk(KERN_INFO"%s: t%u < i%u\n", __FUNCTION__, total_ticks, idle_ticks);

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#59: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c:376:

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#63: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c:380:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
