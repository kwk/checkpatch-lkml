WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#133: FILE: kernel/power/main.c:162:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#190: FILE: kernel/power/main.c:240:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#219: FILE: kernel/power/power.h:180:
+extern int suspend_enter(suspend_state_t state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
