WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'transfered' may be misspelled - perhaps 'transferred'?
#32: 
reservation is transfered on dquot_transfer(). This means what
               ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#72: FILE: fs/quota/dquot.c:1394:
+static qsize_t *inode_reserved_space(struct inode * inode)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#75: FILE: fs/quota/dquot.c:1397:
+	 * quota reservation interface */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#76: FILE: fs/quota/dquot.c:1398:
+	BUG_ON(!inode->i_sb->dq_op->get_reserved_space);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#87: FILE: fs/quota/dquot.c:1409:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#106: FILE: fs/quota/dquot.c:1428:
+	qsize_t ret;
+	spin_lock(&inode->i_lock);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#113: FILE: fs/quota/dquot.c:1435:
+static void inode_incr_space(struct inode *inode, qsize_t number,
+				int reserve)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#355: FILE: fs/quota/dquot.c:1679:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#403: FILE: include/linux/quota.h:318:
+	qsize_t *(*get_reserved_space) (struct inode *);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#403: FILE: include/linux/quota.h:318:
+	qsize_t *(*get_reserved_space) (struct inode *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
