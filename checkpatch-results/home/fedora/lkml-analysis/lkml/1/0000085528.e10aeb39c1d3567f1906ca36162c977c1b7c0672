#31: 
Currently, we have "swap discard" mechanism which sends a discard bio request

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:WxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#98: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:307:
+extern void set_swap_free_notify(unsigned, swap_free_notify_fn *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#100: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:309:
+void set_swap_free_notify(unsigned, swap_free_notify_fn *)

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#116: FILE: init/Kconfig:179:
+config SWAP_FREE_NOTIFY
+	bool "Enable swap free notification"
+	depends on SWAP
+	default y
+	help
+	  This causes swap subsystem to send a callback to swap device when
+	  a swap block becomes free. This is useful in cases such as when
+	  compressed RAM device is used as swap disk.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#141: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:560:
+void set_swap_free_notify(unsigned type, swap_free_notify_fn *notify_fn)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#144: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:563:
+	struct swap_info_struct *sis;
+	sis = get_swap_info_struct(type);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#145: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:564:
+	BUG_ON(!sis);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
