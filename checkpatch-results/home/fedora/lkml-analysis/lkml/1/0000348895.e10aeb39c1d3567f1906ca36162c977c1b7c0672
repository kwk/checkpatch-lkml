Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#243: FILE: fs/proc/proc_net.c:130:
+static struct inode_operations proc_net_dir_inode_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
