ERROR:WEAK_DECLARATION: Using weak declarations can have unintended link defects
#75: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:264:
+extern unsigned long __weak kgdb_arch_pc(int exception, struct pt_regs *regs);

Using weak declarations like __attribute__((weak)) or __weak
can have unintended link defects.  Avoid using them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:264:
+extern unsigned long __weak kgdb_arch_pc(int exception, struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
