CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#126: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:152:
+	hcall_page = shared_addr = kmap(host_page);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sg"
#132: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:158:
+	if (sg == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
