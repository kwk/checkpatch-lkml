#36: 
2.6.23-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#248: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:227:
 	switch (code) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#251: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:230:
+	case BTN_LEFT:		index = 0; break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#440: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:394:
+			mousedev->packet.dx = mousedev->packet.dy =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#551: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:492:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead
#563: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:504:

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
