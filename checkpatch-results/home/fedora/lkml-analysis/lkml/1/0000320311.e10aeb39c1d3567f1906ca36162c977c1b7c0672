WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'paramater' may be misspelled - perhaps 'parameter'?
#68: FILE: Documentation/ide.txt:277:
+You also need to use "probe" kernel paramater for ide-4drives driver
                                     ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#97: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:992:
+extern int probe_4drives;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#140: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/ide-4drives.c:1:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#146: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/ide-4drives.c:7:
+int probe_4drives = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#166: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/ide-4drives.c:27:
+	mate->chipset = hwif->chipset = ide_4drives;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#174: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/ide-4drives.c:35:
+	hwif->serialized = mate->serialized = 1;
