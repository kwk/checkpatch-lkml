WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#53: FILE: drivers/net/atl1e/atl1e_main.c:1797:
+			BUG_ON(tx_buffer->skb);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#67: FILE: drivers/net/chelsio/sge.c:1152:
+	BUG_ON(len > SGE_TX_DESC_MAX_PLEN);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#80: FILE: drivers/net/ixgb/ixgb_osdep.h:43:
+#define ASSERT(x)	BUG_ON(!(x))

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#94: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:1225:
+	BUG_ON(tunnel == NULL);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tunnel"
#94: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:1225:
+	BUG_ON(tunnel == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#111: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ath9k/core.h:55:
+#define ASSERT(exp) BUG_ON(!(exp));

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#111: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ath9k/core.h:55:
+#define ASSERT(exp) BUG_ON(!(exp));

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
