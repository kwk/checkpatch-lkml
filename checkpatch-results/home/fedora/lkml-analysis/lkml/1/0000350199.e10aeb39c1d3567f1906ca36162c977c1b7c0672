CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "vma"
#95: FILE: arch/um/kernel/tlb.c:523:
+	while (vma != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#171: FILE: include/asm-um/tlb.h:64:
+extern void flush_tlb_mm_range(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long start,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
#209: FILE: include/asm-um/tlb.h:102:
+	return;

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'tlb' - possible side-effects?

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'tlb' may be better as '(tlb)' to avoid precedence issues
