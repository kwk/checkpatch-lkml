WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#114: FILE: checkpoint/process.c:41:
+		BUG_ON(t->exit_state != EXIT_ZOMBIE);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#314: FILE: include/linux/checkpoint.h:99:
+extern int ckpt_activate_next(struct ckpt_ctx *ctx);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
