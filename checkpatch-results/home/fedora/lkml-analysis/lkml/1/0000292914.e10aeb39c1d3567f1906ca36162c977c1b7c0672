#28: 
This patch introduces a gfn_to_pfn() function and corresponding functions like

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'pfn_t' should also have an identifier name
#461: FILE: include/linux/kvm_host.h:177:
+void kvm_release_pfn_dirty(pfn_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:NEW_TYPEDEFS: do not add new typedefs
#478: FILE: include/linux/kvm_types.h:41:
+typedef hfn_t pfn_t;

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#538: FILE: virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:554:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(gfn_to_pfn);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
