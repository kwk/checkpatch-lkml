Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#211: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_kprobe.c:581:
+	if (!event) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#214: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_kprobe.c:584:
+		char buf[MAX_EVENT_NAME_LEN];
+		if (symbol)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
