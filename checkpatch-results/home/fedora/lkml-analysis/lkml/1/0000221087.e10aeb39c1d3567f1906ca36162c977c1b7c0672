WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#58: 
#1 and #3 have been suggested to me by Peter Moulder off-list.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#99: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:720:
+	drive->hwif->data_phase = task.data_phase = TASKFILE_NO_DATA;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
