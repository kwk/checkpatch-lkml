WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#54: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#59: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/init_task.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#60: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/init_task.c:2:
+ * arch/microblaze/kernel/init_task.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#75: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/init_task.c:17:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __section(".data.init_task") over __attribute__((__section__(".data.init_task")))
#85: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/init_task.c:27:
+	__attribute__((__section__(".data.init_task"))) =

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#86: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/init_task.c:28:
+	__attribute__((__section__(".data.init_task"))) =
+{ INIT_THREAD_INFO(init_task) };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
