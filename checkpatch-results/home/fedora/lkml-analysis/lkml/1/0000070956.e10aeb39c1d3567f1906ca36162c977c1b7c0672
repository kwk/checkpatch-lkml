CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dws)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dw_dma_slave)...)
#58: FILE: arch/avr32/mach-at32ap/at32ap700x.c:1342:
+	dws = kzalloc(sizeof(struct dw_dma_slave), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#93: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/atmel-mci.c:1590:
+static void setup_dma_addr(struct mci_platform_data *pdata,
+			dma_addr_t tx_addr, dma_addr_t rx_addr)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!host"
#129: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/atmel-mci.c:1622:
+	if (host == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
