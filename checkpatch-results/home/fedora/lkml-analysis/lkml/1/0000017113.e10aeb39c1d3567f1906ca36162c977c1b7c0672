ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#111: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:52:
+static int			include_perf			=      0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "old_filter"
#125: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:246:
+	if (old_filter != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#130: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:251:
+		fprintf(stderr, "excluding perf exceeds max filter length,"
+			" use -P instead\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
