WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#54: FILE: arch/m68k/include/asm/ptemap.h:1:
+#ifndef _M68K_ASM_PTEMAP_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'pmd' may be better as '(pmd)' to avoid precedence issues

+#define pte_offset_map(pmd, address) ((pte_t *)kmap(pmd_page(*pmd)) + pte_index(address))

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#68: FILE: arch/m68k/include/asm/ptemap.h:15:
+#define pte_offset_map(pmdp,address) ((pte_t *)__pmd_page(*pmdp) + (((address) >> PAGE_SHIFT) & (PTRS_PER_PTE - 1)))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
