CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#181: FILE: sound/pci/hda/patch_sigmatel.c:2547:
+		spec->gpio_mask = spec->gpio_data = 0x03;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
