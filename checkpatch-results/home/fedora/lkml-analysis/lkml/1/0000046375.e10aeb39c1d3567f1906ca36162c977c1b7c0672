#64: FILE: drivers/mmc/card/sdio_uart.c:221:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#78: FILE: drivers/mmc/card/sdio_uart.c:509:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'shoudn't' may be misspelled - perhaps 'shouldn't'?
#99: FILE: drivers/mmc/card/sdio_uart.c:578:
+	if (ret)	/* Missing hardware shoudn't block for carrier */
 	        	                    ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#99: FILE: drivers/mmc/card/sdio_uart.c:578:
+	unsigned int ret = sdio_uart_claim_func(port);
+	if (ret)	/* Missing hardware shoudn't block for carrier */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
