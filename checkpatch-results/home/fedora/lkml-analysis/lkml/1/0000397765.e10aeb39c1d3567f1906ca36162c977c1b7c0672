CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*tmp)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct parport)...)
#44: FILE: drivers/parport/share.c:285:
+	tmp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct parport), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
