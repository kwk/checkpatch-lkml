WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct wacom_features should normally be const
#73: FILE: drivers/input/tablet/wacom_sys.c:666:
+static struct wacom_features wacom_features[] = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#207: FILE: drivers/input/tablet/wacom_sys.c:800:
+static struct wacom_features * get_wacom_feature(const struct usb_device_id *id)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

spaces are never used for indentation.
