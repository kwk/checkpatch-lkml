CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#202: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:559:
+		if (parent && parent != &cfqe->rb_node) {
[...]
 		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#283: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:620:
+static void __enqueue_cfqe(struct cfq_service_tree *st, struct cfq_entity *cfqe,
 				 int add_front)

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'key == cfqe_key(st, __cfqe)'
#300: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:632:
+		if (key < cfqe_key(st, __cfqe) ||
+			(add_front && (key == cfqe_key(st, __cfqe)))) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
