CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#76: FILE: fs/pipe.c:1081:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#90: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:141:
+#define MS_NOREFCOUNT	(1<<29) /* kernel static mnt : no refcounting needed */
                      	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#90: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:141:
+#define MS_NOREFCOUNT	(1<<29) /* kernel static mnt : no refcounting needed */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
