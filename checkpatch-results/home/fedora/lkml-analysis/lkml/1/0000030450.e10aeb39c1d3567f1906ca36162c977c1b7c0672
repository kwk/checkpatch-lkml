WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#83: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#88: FILE: include/linux/prctl_network.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_PRCTL_NETWORK_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/linux/prctl_network.h:4:
+extern long prctl_get_network(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#92: FILE: include/linux/prctl_network.h:5:
+extern long prctl_set_network(unsigned long);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#92: FILE: include/linux/prctl_network.h:5:
+extern long prctl_set_network(unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
