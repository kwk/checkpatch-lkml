CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#201: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:918:
+extern int do_sync_mapping_range(struct address_space *mapping, loff_t offset,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#202: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:919:
+extern int do_sync_mapping_range(struct address_space *mapping, loff_t offset,
+			loff_t endbyte, unsigned int flags);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#220: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1460:
+extern int rw_verify_area(int, struct file *, loff_t *, size_t);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#222: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1462:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
