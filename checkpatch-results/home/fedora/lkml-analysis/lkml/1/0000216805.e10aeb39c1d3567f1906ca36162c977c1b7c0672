CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "d_ancestor"
#106: FILE: fs/dcache.c:2172:
+		result = (d_ancestor(old_dentry, new_dentry) != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#117: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:290:
+extern struct dentry *d_ancestor(struct dentry *, struct dentry *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dentry *' should also have an identifier name
#117: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:290:
+extern struct dentry *d_ancestor(struct dentry *, struct dentry *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
