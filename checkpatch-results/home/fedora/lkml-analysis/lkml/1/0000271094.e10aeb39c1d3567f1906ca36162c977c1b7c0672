CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+				rt_rq->rt_runtime == rt_b->rt_runtime)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#172: FILE: kernel/sched_rt.c:352:
+		BUG_ON(want);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#274: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7464:
+		/* fall-through */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#282: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7470:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
