WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#48: FILE: fs/Kconfig:1286:
+config JFFS2_SYSFS
+	bool "JFFS2 sysfs attributes"
+	depends on JFFS2_FS
+	default n
+	help
+	  Enable control of jffs2 features through sysfs.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'unkown' may be misspelled - perhaps 'unknown'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#140: FILE: fs/jffs2/super.c:329:
+	.mode = S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#169: FILE: fs/jffs2/super.c:358:
+static struct sysfs_ops jffs2_sysfs_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
