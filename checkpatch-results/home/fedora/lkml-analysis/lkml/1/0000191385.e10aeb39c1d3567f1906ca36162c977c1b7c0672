WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#141: FILE: fs/ocfs2/xattr.c:395:
+	BUG_ON(why != RESTART_NONE || clusters_to_add);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#407: FILE: fs/ocfs2/xattr.c:1338:

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#759: FILE: fs/ocfs2/xattr.c:2177:
+	mlog(0, "Set xattr %s, reserve meta blocks = %d, clusters = %d, "
+	     "credits = %d\n", xi->name, meta_add, clusters_add, *credits);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#906: FILE: fs/ocfs2/xattr.c:2412:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
