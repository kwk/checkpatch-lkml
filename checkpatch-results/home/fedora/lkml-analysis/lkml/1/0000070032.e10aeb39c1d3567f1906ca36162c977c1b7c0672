Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'fo' may be misspelled - perhaps 'of'?

                            ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#189: FILE: drivers/net/slip.c:1261:
+^I.hangup^I ^I= slip_hangup,$

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#198: FILE: drivers/net/slip.c:1336:
+	/* FIXME: hangup is async so we should wait when doing this second
+	   phase */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
