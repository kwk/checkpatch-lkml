#43: 
Subject: [PATCH] add default mode CONFIG_EDD_OFF=n, override with edd={on,off}

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#94: FILE: arch/x86/boot/edd.c:142:
+		if (!strcmp(eddarg, "skipmbr") || !strcmp(eddarg, "skip")) {
[...]
 		else if (!strcmp(eddarg, "off"))
[...]
+		else if (!strcmp(eddarg, "on"))
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#113: FILE: drivers/firmware/Kconfig:20:
+config EDD_OFF
+	bool "Sets default behavior for EDD detection to off"
+	depends on EDD
+	default n
+	help
+	  Say Y if you want EDD disabled by default, even though it is compiled into the
+	  kernel. Say N if you want EDD enabled by default. EDD can be dynamically set
+	  using the kernel parameter 'edd={on|skipmbr|off}'.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
