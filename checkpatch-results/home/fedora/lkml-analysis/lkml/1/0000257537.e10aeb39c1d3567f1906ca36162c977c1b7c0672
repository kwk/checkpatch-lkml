CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1042:
+extern int ext4_can_truncate(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_notice([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_notice(dev, ... then pr_notice(...  to printk(KERN_NOTICE ...
#74: FILE: fs/ext4/ialloc.c:849:
+		printk(KERN_NOTICE "i_nlink=%u\n", inode->i_nlink);
