WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#79: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig.debug:248:
+config DEBUG_VIRTUAL
+	bool "Virtual memory translation debugging"
+	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && NUMA && X86_64
+	help
+	  Enable some costly sanity checks in the NUMA virtual to page
+          code.  This can catch mistakes with virt_to_page() and friends.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#96: FILE: include/asm-x86/mmzone_64.h:11:
+#define VIRTUAL_BUG_ON(x) BUG_ON(x)

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
