ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#62: FILE: net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:440:
+++ b/net/ipv6/af_inet6.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
