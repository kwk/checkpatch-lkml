ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#83: 
--- a/Makefile

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#90: FILE: Makefile:511:
+# Arch Makefiles may override this setting

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
