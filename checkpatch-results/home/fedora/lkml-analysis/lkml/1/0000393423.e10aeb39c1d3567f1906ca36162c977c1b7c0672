Subject: [PATCH 12/20] Miscelaneous preparations for pid namespaces
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix '.' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#76: FILE: include/linux/pid_namespace.h:55:
+	BUG_ON(tsk != current);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#104: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1386:
+extern int is_container_init(struct task_struct *tsk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pid"
#123: FILE: kernel/pid.c:82:
+	if (pid != NULL && pid->numbers[pid->level].nr == 1)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
