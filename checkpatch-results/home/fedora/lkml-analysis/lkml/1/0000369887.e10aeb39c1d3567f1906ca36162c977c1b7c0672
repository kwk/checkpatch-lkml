CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/mpc52xx.h:272:
+extern int mpc52xx_pm_prepare(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct platform_suspend_ops should normally be const

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
