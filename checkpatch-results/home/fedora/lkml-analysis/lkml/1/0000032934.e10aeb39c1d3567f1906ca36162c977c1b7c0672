+extern void __iomem * early_ioremap (unsigned long phys_addr, unsigned long size);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: arch/ia64/include/asm/io.h:427:
+extern void __iomem * early_ioremap (unsigned long phys_addr, unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
