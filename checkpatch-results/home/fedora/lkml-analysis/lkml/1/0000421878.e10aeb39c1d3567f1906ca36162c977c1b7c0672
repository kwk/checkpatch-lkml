 comment "LED Triggers"
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#79: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#84: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-generic.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('
#110: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-generic.c:27:
+static inline struct led_generic_device *pdev_to_led(

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#123: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-generic.c:40:
+static int leds_generic_suspend(struct platform_device *pdev,
+	pm_message_t state)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*led)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct led_generic_device)...)
#168: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-generic.c:85:
+	led = kzalloc(sizeof(struct led_generic_device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!led"
#169: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-generic.c:86:
+	if (led == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:OOM_MESSAGE: Possible unnecessary 'out of memory' message
#170: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-generic.c:87:
