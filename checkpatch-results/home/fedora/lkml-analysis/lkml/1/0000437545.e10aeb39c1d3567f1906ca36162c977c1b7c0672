CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: arch/um/include/user.h:30:
+extern int reserved_address(void *addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#63: FILE: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c:507:
+	return(PageReserved(page));

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#87: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/main.c:286:
+	if(kmalloc_ok && reserved_address(ptr))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#87: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/main.c:286:
+	if(kmalloc_ok && reserved_address(ptr))
[...]
+	else if((addr >= uml_physmem) && (addr < high_physmem)){
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
