CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*bio)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct bio)...)
#209: FILE: fs/bio.c:366:
+	bio = kmalloc(sizeof(struct bio) + nr_iovecs * sizeof(struct bio_vec),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
