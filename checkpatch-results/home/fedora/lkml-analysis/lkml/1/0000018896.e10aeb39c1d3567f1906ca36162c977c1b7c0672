CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'pagesize' - possible side-effects?
#80: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/amd_iommu_types.h:199:
+#define PAGE_SIZE_PTE(address, pagesize)		\
+		(((address) | ((pagesize) - 1)) &	\
+		 (~(pagesize >> 1)) & PM_ADDR_MASK)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#104: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:740:
+	BUG_ON(!is_power_of_2(page_size));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#160: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:834:
+	if (page_size > PAGE_SIZE) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
