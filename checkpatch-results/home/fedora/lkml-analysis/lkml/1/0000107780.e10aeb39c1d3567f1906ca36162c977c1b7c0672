CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#126: FILE: include/linux/kvm.h:310:

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#510: FILE: virt/kvm/eventfd.c:498:
+	if (!group) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#568: FILE: virt/kvm/eventfd.c:556:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
