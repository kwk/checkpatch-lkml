WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'nand_do_write_oob', this function's name, in a string
#61: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c:1951:
+		DEBUG(MTD_DEBUG_LEVEL0, "nand_do_write_oob: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
