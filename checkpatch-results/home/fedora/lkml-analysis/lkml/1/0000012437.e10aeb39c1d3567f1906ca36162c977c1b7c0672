CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#835: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:215:
+extern void kgdb_arch_set_pc(struct pt_regs *regs, unsigned long pc);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
