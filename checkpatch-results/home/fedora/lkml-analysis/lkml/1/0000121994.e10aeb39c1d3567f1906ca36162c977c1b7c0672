CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#127: FILE: include/linux/pid.h:122:
+extern struct pid *alloc_pid(struct pid_namespace *ns, int *nr, unsigned int level);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#237: FILE: kernel/kstate/kstate-task.c:307:
+	current->pid = current->tgid = pid_nr(pid);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#326: FILE: kernel/pid.c:193:
+	map = &pid_ns->pidmap[pid/BITS_PER_PAGE];
 	                         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#473: FILE: kernel/pid.c:659:
+	pr_debug("dump pid %p: ref {%llu, %u}, rv %d\n", pid, (unsigned long long)obj->o_ref.pos, obj->o_ref.id, rv);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
