#30: 
Change on-disk format for extent to represent uninitialized/initialized extents

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#137: FILE: include/linux/ext4_fs_extents.h:161:
+#define EXT_INIT_MAX_LEN	(1UL << 15)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#147: FILE: include/linux/ext4_fs_extents.h:212:
+	BUG_ON((le16_to_cpu(ext->ee_len) & ~0x8000) == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
