#33: 
'printk' and the tracer at run-time...other ideas? Patch is against the -tip 

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#52: FILE: include/linux/dynamic_printk.h:37:
+extern void dynamic_debug_trace_printk(const char *fmt, ...);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#78: FILE: kernel/trace/Kconfig:152:
+config DYNAMIC_DEBUG_TRACER
+	bool "Trace dynamic debug"
+	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
+	select TRACING
+	help
+	  This tracer records all dynamic debug output.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#101: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#106: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_dynamic_debug.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo __read_mostly	bar" should be "foo __read_mostly bar"
#124: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_dynamic_debug.c:19:
+static int __read_mostly	debug_enabled;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#235: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_dynamic_debug.c:130:
+static struct tracer dynamic_debug_trace __read_mostly =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
