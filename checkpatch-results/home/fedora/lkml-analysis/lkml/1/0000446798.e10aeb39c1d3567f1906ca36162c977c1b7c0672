#37: 
ra.offset variable so now we can reliably detect sequetial reads.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#53: 
Introduce ra.offset and store in it an offset where the previous read ended. This way

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#108: FILE: mm/filemap.c:950:
+		prev_offset = ra.offset = offset;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
