CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#109: FILE: drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:323:
+	for (csrow = 0; csrow < CHIPSELECT_COUNT; csrow++) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#223: FILE: drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:437:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
