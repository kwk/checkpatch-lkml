WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*tp)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct ktermios)...)
#43: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2037:
+		tp = kmalloc(sizeof(struct ktermios),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#44: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2038:
+		tp = kmalloc(sizeof(struct ktermios),
 						GFP_KERNEL);
