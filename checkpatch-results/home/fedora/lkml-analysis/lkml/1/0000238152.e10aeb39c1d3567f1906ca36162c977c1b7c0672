WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#259: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2802:
+	struct vc_data *vc = tty->driver_data;
+	BUG_ON(vc == NULL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#259: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2802:
+	BUG_ON(vc == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vc"
#259: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2802:
+	BUG_ON(vc == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#286: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:355:
+extern void tty_shutdown(struct tty_struct *tty);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#287: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:356:
+extern void tty_free_termios(struct tty_struct *tty);
