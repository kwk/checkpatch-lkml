WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#74: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/dlpar.c:418:
+	rc = strict_strtoul(buf, 0, &drc_index);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
