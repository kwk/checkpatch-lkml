WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#97: FILE: kernel/power/Kconfig:97:
+config PM_TEST_SUSPEND
+	bool "Test suspend/resume and wakealarm during bootup"
+	depends on SUSPEND && PM_DEBUG && RTC_LIB=y
+	---help---
+	This option will let you suspend your machine during bootup, and
+	make it wake up a few seconds later using an RTC wakeup alarm.
+	Enable this with a kernel parameter like "test_suspend=mem".
+
+	You probably want to have your system's RTC driver statically
+	linked, ensuring that it's available when this test runs.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
