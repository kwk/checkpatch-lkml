WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#115: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/serial2002.c:401:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "serial_2002: file open error = %ld\n",

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*config_data)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct config_data_t)...)
#135: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/serial2002.c:419:
+		config_data = kmalloc(sizeof(struct config_data_t), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#272: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/serial2002.c:488:
+						int unit, sign, min;
+						unit =

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#282: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/serial2002.c:498:
+						switch (unit) {

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1328311239.21255.24.camel@joe2Laptop/

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#293: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/serial2002.c:509:
+						if (sign)

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#296: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/serial2002.c:512:
+						cur_config[channel].min
+						    = min;

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#479: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/serial2002.c:626:
+							    (const struct comedi_lrange *) &range[j];

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#479: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/serial2002.c:626:
+							    (const struct comedi_lrange *) &range[j];

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'devpriv->tty != 0'
#494: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/serial2002.c:642:
+	if (!IS_ERR(devpriv->tty) && (devpriv->tty != 0))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
