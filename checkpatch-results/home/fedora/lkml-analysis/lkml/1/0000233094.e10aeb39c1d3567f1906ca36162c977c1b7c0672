Subject: [PATCH] firmware: avoiding multiple replication for same firmware file

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#85: FILE: drivers/base/firmware_class.c:53:
+ * for same firmware file */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*tmp)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct firmware_list)...)
#129: FILE: drivers/base/firmware_class.c:432:
+	tmp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct firmware_list), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
