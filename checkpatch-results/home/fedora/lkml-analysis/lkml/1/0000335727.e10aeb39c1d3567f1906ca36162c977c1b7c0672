CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#144: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/qd65xx.c:327:
+	if (QD_CONTROL(hwif) & QD_CONTR_SEC_DISABLED) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#148: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/qd65xx.c:331:
+		t2 = t1 = hwif->channel ? QD6580_DEF_DATA2 : QD6580_DEF_DATA;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
