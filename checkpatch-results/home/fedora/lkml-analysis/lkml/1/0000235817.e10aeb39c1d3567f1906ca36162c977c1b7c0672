WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#123: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_32.c:1373:
+		printk("x2apic enabled by BIOS, switching to x2apic ops\n");

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#124: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_32.c:1374:
+		x2apic_preenabled = x2apic = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#135: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_32.c:1385:

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#217: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_32.c:1467:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
