The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#126: FILE: drivers/input/misc/input-polldev.c:41:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "input-polldev: failed to create "
+				"ipolldevd workqueue\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dev)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct input_polled_dev)...)
#163: FILE: drivers/input/misc/input-polldev.c:78:
+	dev = kzalloc(sizeof(struct input_polled_dev), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
