#29: 
However, unlike everything else in vsnprintf, it would NOT be locking-agnostic.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#134: FILE: fs/ocfs2/file.c:2182:
+	mlog_entry("(0x%p, %u, '%pd')\n", filp,
 	                                  ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#198: FILE: lib/vsprintf.c:884:
+static char *dname_string(char *buf, char *end, struct dentry *d,
+			 struct printf_spec spec)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#201: FILE: lib/vsprintf.c:887:
+	char *res;
+	spin_lock(&d->d_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
