#30: 
This patch merges the lock_nolock module into GFS2 itself. As well as removing

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#184: FILE: fs/gfs2/locking.c:58:
+	if (!c)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#186: FILE: fs/gfs2/locking.c:60:
+	else {

WARNING:NAKED_SSCANF: unchecked sscanf return value
#188: FILE: fs/gfs2/locking.c:62:
+		sscanf(c, "%u", &jid);

WARNING:SSCANF_TO_KSTRTO: Prefer kstrto<type> to single variable sscanf
#188: FILE: fs/gfs2/locking.c:62:
+		sscanf(c, "%u", &jid);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#207: FILE: fs/gfs2/locking.c:161:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
