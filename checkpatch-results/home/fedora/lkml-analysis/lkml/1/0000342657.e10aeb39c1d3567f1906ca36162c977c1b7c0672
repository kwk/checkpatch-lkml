WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#42: 
  introduction of head32.o (which seems like a win to introduce for readability)

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#105: FILE: arch/x86/Makefile:42:
+        include $(srctree)/arch/x86/Makefile_32.cpu

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#320: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.
