WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#40: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:182:
+extern int FASTCALL(queue_work_on_cpu(struct workqueue_struct *wq, struct work_struct *work, int cpu));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#40: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:182:
+extern int FASTCALL(queue_work_on_cpu(struct workqueue_struct *wq, struct work_struct *work, int cpu));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#58: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:184:
+		BUG_ON(!list_empty(&work->entry));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
