WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#83: 
# cat /proc/1072/checkpointable

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#123: FILE: checkpoint/ckpt_file.c:81:
+	printk("%s() left: %d\n", __func__, left);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#128: FILE: checkpoint/ckpt_file.c:86:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#161: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1606:
+	int p = 0;
+	if (!info)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#164: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1609:
+	p += snprintf(info+p, max-p, "pos:\t%lli\n", (long long) file->f_pos);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
