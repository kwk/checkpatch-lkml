CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#222: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:540:
+	if (host->disable_delay) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#224: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:542:
+		mmc_schedule_delayed_work(&host->disable,
+				msecs_to_jiffies(host->disable_delay));

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#226: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:544:
+	} else

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'disble' may be misspelled - perhaps 'disable'?
#325: FILE: include/linux/mmc/host.h:77:
+	 * Because lazy disble may be called from a work queue, the 'disable'
 	                ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#338: FILE: include/linux/mmc/host.h:150:
+#define MMC_CAP_DISABLE		(1 << 7)	/* Can the host be disabled */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
