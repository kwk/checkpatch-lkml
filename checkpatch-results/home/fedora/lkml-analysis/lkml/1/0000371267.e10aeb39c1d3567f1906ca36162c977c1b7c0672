Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#185: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:489:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "Race in mem_cgroup_uncharge() ?");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'mem_cgroup_uncharge', this function's name, in a string
#185: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:489:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "Race in mem_cgroup_uncharge() ?");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
