#26: 
This lets us treat the case where mod == 3 in the same manner as other cases.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#49: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86_emulate.c:1048:
+			c->dst.val = c->dst.orig_val = c->modrm_val;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
