sound/isa/sb16/sb16.c:559: warning: ‘err’ may be used uninitialized in this function

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#52: FILE: sound/isa/sb/sb16.c:557:
 static int __devinit snd_sb16_isa_probe(struct device *pdev, unsigned int dev)

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#62: FILE: sound/isa/sb/sb16.c:587:
+		int uninitialized_var(err);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'err' should also have an identifier name
#62: FILE: sound/isa/sb/sb16.c:587:
+		int uninitialized_var(err);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
