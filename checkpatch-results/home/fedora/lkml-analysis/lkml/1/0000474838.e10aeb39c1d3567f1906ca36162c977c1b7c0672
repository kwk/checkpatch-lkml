ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#70: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:270:
+static long rcu_torture_preempt_errors = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "rcu_preeempt_task"
#107: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:307:
+	if (rcu_preeempt_task != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#114: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:314:
+static int rcu_preempt_stats(char *page) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#119: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:319:
+	return (cnt);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#125: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:325:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#125: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:325:
+{
+	

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cur_ops->preemptend"
#191: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:938:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cur_ops->preemptstart"
