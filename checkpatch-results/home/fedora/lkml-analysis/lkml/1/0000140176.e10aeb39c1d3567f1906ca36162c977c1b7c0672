WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Non-standard signature: 'Singed-off-by:' - perhaps 'Signed-off-by:'?
#45: 
Singed-off-by: Mike Waychison <mikew@google.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#104: FILE: mm/filemap.c:738:
+unsigned find_lock_page_retry(struct address_space *mapping, pgoff_t offset,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#105: FILE: mm/filemap.c:739:
+unsigned find_lock_page_retry(struct address_space *mapping, pgoff_t offset,
+				struct vm_area_struct *vma, struct page **ppage,

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#114: FILE: mm/filemap.c:748:
+		if (!retry)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
