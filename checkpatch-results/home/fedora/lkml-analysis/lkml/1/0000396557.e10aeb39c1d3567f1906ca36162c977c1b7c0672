CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cur->dev"
#71: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/reboot_fixups.c:65:
+		if (cur->dev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxV)
#84: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/reboot_fixups.c:77:
+	for (i=0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(fixups_table); i++) {
 	      ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around fixups_table[i]
#85: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/reboot_fixups.c:78:
+		cur = &(fixups_table[i]);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
