WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#61: FILE: arch/mips/include/asm/vr41xx/giu.h:44:
+extern void vr41xx_set_irq_trigger(unsigned int pin, irq_trigger_t trigger,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#806: FILE: drivers/gpio/Kconfig:76:
+config GPIO_VR41XX
+	tristate "NEC VR4100 series General-purpose I/O Uint support"
+	depends on CPU_VR41XX
+	help
+	  Say yes here to support the NEC VR4100 series General-purpose I/O Uint
+
 comment "I2C GPIO expanders:"
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

#827: FILE: drivers/gpio/vr41xx_giu.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#845: FILE: drivers/gpio/vr41xx_giu.c:19:
+ *  along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
