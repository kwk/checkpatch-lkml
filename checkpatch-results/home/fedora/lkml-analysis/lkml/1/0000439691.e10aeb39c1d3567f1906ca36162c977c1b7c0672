--- a/include/asm-i386/uaccess.h~i386-uaccess-debugging

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#179: FILE: arch/i386/lib/usercopy.c:900:
+	if (in_atomic())

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.
