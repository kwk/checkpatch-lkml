The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#154: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/amd_iommu_types.h:461:
+extern void amd_iommu_reset_cmd_buffer(struct amd_iommu *iommu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
