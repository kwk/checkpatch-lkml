#28: 
It is unnecessarily fragile to have two places (fsync_super() and do_sync())

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#319: FILE: fs/sync.c:37:
+	printk("Emergency Sync complete\n");

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#341: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1945:
+extern int __sync_blockdev(struct block_device *bdev, int wait);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
