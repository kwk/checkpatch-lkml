Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct block_device_operations should normally be const
#254: FILE: drivers/block/ps3vram.c:92:
+static struct block_device_operations ps3vram_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around priv->fifo_ptr
#329: FILE: drivers/block/ps3vram.c:167:
+	*(priv->fifo_ptr)++ = data;

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#538: FILE: drivers/block/ps3vram.c:376:
+	offset = (unsigned int) (address & (cache->page_size - 1));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*priv->cache.tags)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ps3vram_tag)...)
#569: FILE: drivers/block/ps3vram.c:407:
+	priv->cache.tags = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ps3vram_tag) *

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!priv->cache.tags"

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
