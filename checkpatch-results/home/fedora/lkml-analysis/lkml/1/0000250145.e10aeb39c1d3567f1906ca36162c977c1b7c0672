  ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const void *' should also have an identifier name
#99: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:99:
+void * __must_check __krealloc(const void *, size_t, gfp_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'size_t' should also have an identifier name
#99: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:99:
+void * __must_check __krealloc(const void *, size_t, gfp_t);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'gfp_t' should also have an identifier name
#99: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:99:
+void * __must_check __krealloc(const void *, size_t, gfp_t);
