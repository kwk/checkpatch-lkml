(lockdep, UML: fix compilation when CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS_SUPPORT is not set).

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#51: FILE: arch/um/include/asm/system.h:20:
+                                   local_irq_disable(); } while(0)$

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
