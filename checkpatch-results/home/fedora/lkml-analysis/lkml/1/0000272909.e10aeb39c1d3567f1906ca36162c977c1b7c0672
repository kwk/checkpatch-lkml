ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#68: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drmP.h:245:
+		static int count = 0;					\

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#72: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drmP.h:249:
+			BUG_ON(count == 3);				\

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
