Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#122: FILE: fs/omfs/inode.c:85:
+	inode->i_atime = inode->i_mtime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

+	if (S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode))
[...]
+	else if (S_ISREG(inode->i_mode))

+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO | S_IXUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0777'.
#296: FILE: fs/omfs/inode.c:259:
+		inode->i_mode = S_IFDIR | S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO | S_IXUGO;

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of

constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
