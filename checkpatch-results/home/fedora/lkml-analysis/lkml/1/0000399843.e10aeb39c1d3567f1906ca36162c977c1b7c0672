CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#467: FILE: include/asm-blackfin/bfin-global.h:64:
+extern void init_exception_vectors(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
