CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*child_device_ctx)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct vm_device)...)
#303: FILE: drivers/staging/hv/vmbus_drv.c:480:
+	child_device_ctx = kzalloc(sizeof(struct vm_device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
