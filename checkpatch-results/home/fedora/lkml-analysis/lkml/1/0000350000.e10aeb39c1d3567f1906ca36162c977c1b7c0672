ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#96: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:1367:
+^Iint ret; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#97: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/sge.c:1368:
+	int ret; 
+	local_bh_disable();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
