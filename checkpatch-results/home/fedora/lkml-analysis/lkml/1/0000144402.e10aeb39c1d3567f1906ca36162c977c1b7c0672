Refactor the post lock acquisition logic from futex_lock_pi().  This code will

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'fixup_owner', this function's name, in a string
#138: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1322:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "fixup_owner: ret = %d pi-mutex: %p "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#139: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1323:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "fixup_owner: ret = %d pi-mutex: %p "
+				"pi-state %p\n", ret,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
