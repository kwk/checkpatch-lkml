Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#159: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:1799:
+		BUG_ON(*link);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#167: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:1807:
+static unsigned fuse_file_poll(struct file *file, poll_table *wait)

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#209: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:1849:
+	if (err == -ENOSYS) {

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#342: FILE: include/linux/fuse.h:171:
+#define FUSE_POLL_SCHEDULE_NOTIFY (1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
