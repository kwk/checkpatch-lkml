CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#64: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_reg.h:1794:
+#define   G4X_FBC_WM_EN		(1<<31) /* GM45+ only */
                        		  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#64: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_reg.h:1794:
+#define   G4X_FBC_WM_EN		(1<<31) /* GM45+ only */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
