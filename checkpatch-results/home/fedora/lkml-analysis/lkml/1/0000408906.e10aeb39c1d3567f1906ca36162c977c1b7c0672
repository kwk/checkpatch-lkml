CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 's8' over 'int8_t'
#180: FILE: fs/dlm/lock.c:1604:
+	int8_t is_convert = (lkb->lkb_grmode != DLM_LOCK_IV);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#202: FILE: fs/dlm/lock.c:1625:
+			if (err)
[...]
+			else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#204: FILE: fs/dlm/lock.c:1627:
+			else {

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'can_be_granted', this function's name, in a string
#205: FILE: fs/dlm/lock.c:1628:
+				log_print("can_be_granted deadlock %x now %d",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
