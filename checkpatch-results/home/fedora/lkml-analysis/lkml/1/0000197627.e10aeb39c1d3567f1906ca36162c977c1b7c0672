WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#93: FILE: kernel/sched_debug.c:137:
+		uid_t uid = cfs_rq->tg->uid;
+		SEQ_printf(m, "\ncfs_rq[%d] for UID: %u\n", cpu, uid);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#151: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2223:
+extern void set_tg_uid(struct user_struct *user);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
