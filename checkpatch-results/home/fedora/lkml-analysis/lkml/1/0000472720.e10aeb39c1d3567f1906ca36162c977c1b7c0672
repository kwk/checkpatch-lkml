Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.

+^I59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,

#487: FILE: drivers/input/misc/rfkill.c:395:
+	__ATTR(status, S_IRUGO, rfkill_key_status_show, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and

kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the

constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
