Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct snd_soc_dai_ops should normally be const
#389: FILE: sound/soc/s3c24xx/s3c-i2s-v2.c:627:
+	struct snd_soc_dai_ops *ops = dai->ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
