CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/delay.h:18:
+extern void udelay_simple(unsigned long usecs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#71: FILE: arch/s390/lib/delay.c:104:
+	end = get_clock() + ((u64) usecs << 12);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
