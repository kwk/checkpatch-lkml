WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct kgdb_arch should normally be const
#111: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:262:
+extern struct kgdb_arch	arch_kgdb_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#117: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:266:
+extern int kgdb_register_io_module(const struct kgdb_io *local_kgdb_io_ops);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
