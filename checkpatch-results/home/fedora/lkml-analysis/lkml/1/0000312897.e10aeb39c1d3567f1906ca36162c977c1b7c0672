Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#126: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1491:
+extern int security_module_enable(struct security_operations *ops);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#147: FILE: security/dummy.c:1002:
+	BUG_ON(!ops->name);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
