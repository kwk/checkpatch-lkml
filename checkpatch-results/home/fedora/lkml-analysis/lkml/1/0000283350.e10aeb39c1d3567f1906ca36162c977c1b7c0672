the primary one has alrady switched to PAT. We have no way to undo

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#301: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pat.c:73:
+		BUG_ON(boot_pat_state);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#327: FILE: include/asm-x86/pat.h:9:
+extern void validate_pat_support(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#339: FILE: include/asm-x86/pat.h:21:
