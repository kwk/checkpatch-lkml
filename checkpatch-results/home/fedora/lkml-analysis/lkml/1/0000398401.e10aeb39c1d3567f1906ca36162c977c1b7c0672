WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#56: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:451:
+	BUG_ON(rq->first_offset);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Do not use assignments in if condition.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
