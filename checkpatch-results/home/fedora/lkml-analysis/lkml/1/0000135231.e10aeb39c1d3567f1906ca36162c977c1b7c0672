#31: 
romfs_lookup() should be using a routine akin to strcmp() on the backing store,

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#55: FILE: fs/romfs/internal.h:46:
+extern int romfs_dev_strcmp(struct super_block *sb, unsigned long pos,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#77: FILE: fs/romfs/storage.c:78:
+	 * trailing NUL whilst we're at it */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#148: FILE: fs/romfs/storage.c:200:
+		BUG_ON((pos & (ROMBSIZE - 1)) != 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
