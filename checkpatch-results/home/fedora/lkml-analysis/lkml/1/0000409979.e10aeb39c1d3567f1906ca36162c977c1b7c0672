#30: 
This is a patch for fixing icache flush race in ia64(Montecito) by implementing

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'fetch'
#94: 
 Note: CPU(A) will fetch fetch correct instruction in above case.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#146: FILE: include/asm-ia64/cacheflush.h:19:
+extern void __flush_icache_page_ia64(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#157: FILE: include/asm-ia64/cacheflush.h:28:
+flush_cache_page(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long vmaddr,
+		unsigned long pfn)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#161: FILE: include/asm-ia64/cacheflush.h:32:
+		struct page *page;
+		if (!pfn_valid(pfn))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
