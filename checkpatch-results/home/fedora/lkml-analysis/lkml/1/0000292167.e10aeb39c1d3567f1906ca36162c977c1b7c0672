WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#67: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:240:
+static void init_stripe(struct stripe_head *sh, sector_t sector, int pd_idx, int disks, struct bio *bi)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#108: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:423:
+			if (sh->dev[i].towrite) {
+				bi->bi_io_context = sh->dev[i].towrite->bi_io_context;
+			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
