Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#108: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:615:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:246:
+extern int pci_sriov_resource_alignment(struct pci_dev *dev, int resno);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
