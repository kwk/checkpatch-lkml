CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#241: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/io_apic_32.c:2068:
+			else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#1072: FILE: drivers/xen/events.c:144:
+		struct irq_desc *desc = get_irq_desc(i);
+		desc->affinity = cpumask_of_cpu(0);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#1099: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:188:
+extern struct irq_desc *get_irq_desc(unsigned int irq);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#1389: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:87:
+		nr_irq_desc = simple_strtoul(arg, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#1424: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:121:
+	BUG_ON(irq == -1U);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#1426: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:123:
+	desc_pri = desc = &irq_desc[0];

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*desc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct irq_desc)...)
#1446: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:143:
+		desc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct irq_desc)*nr_irq_desc, GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
