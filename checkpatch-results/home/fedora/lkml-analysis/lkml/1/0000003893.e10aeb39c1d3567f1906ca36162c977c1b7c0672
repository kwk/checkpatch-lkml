WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#98: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:18:
+extern char **environ;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: char * array declaration might be better as static const
#143: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:474:
+			char *newargv[] = { cmdline, path, NULL };

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#151: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:482:
+				if (dup2(fd_new_stderr, 1) < 0) {
+					_exit(2);
+			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "slv"
#159: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:490:
+			if (slv != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
