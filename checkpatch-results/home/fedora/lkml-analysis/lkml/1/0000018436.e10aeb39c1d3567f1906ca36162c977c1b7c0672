Subject: [PATCH] pata_it8213: move code to be re-used by ide2libata to pata_it8213.h

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#207: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_it8213.h:1:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#220: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_it8213.h:14:
+	u8 tmp;
+	pci_read_config_byte(pdev, 0x42, &tmp);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'programing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'programming'?
#235: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_it8213.h:29:
+	 *	See Intel Document 298600-004 for the timing programing rules
 	  	                                             ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#254: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_it8213.h:48:
+	/* If the drive MWDMA is faster than it can do PIO then
+	   we must force PIO into PIO0 */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
