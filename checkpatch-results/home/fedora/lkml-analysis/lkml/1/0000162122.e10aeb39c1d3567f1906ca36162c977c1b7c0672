By this, on 64bit machine, size of swap_cgroup goes down to 2 bytes from 8bytes.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#88: FILE: include/linux/page_cgroup.h:94:
+extern unsigned short swap_cgroup_record(swp_entry_t ent, unsigned short id);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
