WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .43
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#193: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_diag.c:150:
+				 "The access mode of a DIAG device changed"
+				 " to read-only");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'rc != 4'
#206: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_diag.c:444:
+	if (rc && (rc != 4)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#266: FILE: include/net/netfilter/ipv6/nf_conntrack_ipv6.h:12:
+extern struct sk_buff *nf_ct_frag6_gather(struct sk_buff *skb, u32 user);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#286: FILE: net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_conntrack_l3proto_ipv6.c:194:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
