#49: FILE: examine_mmap.c:1:
+/* Make with gcc -o examine_mmap examine_mmap.c */

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#49: FILE: examine_mmap.c:1:
+/* Make with gcc -o examine_mmap examine_mmap.c */

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#114: FILE: kernel/examiner.c:13:
+	addr = simple_strtoul(addrstr, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#120: FILE: kernel/examiner.c:19:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
