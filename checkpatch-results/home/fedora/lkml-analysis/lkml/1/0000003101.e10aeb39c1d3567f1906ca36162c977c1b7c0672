WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#113: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#118: FILE: tools/perf/util/table.c:1:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#145: FILE: tools/perf/util/table.c:28:
+		struct column_format *fmt
+			= container_of(l, struct column_format, formats);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#171: FILE: tools/perf/util/table.c:54:
+	BUG_ON(trunc < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#196: FILE: tools/perf/util/table.c:79:
+		struct column_format *fmt
+			= container_of(l, struct column_format, formats);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#199: FILE: tools/perf/util/table.c:82:
+			BUG_ON(fmt->size != SIZE_OF_ADDR);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#207: FILE: tools/perf/util/table.c:90:
+				char *trunced = zalloc(fmt->trunc + 1);
+				memcpy(trunced, str, fmt->trunc);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'table_printf', this function's name, in a string
#230: FILE: tools/perf/util/table.c:113:
+				die("table_printf(): unknown size:%d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:IF_0: Consider removing the code enclosed by this #if 0 and its #endif
#244: FILE: tools/perf/util/table.c:127:
+#if 0

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#259: FILE: tools/perf/util/table.c:142:
+	table_printf(t, table_printf, 42, "Answer to the Ultimate Question of "
+		     "Life, the Universe, and Everything");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
