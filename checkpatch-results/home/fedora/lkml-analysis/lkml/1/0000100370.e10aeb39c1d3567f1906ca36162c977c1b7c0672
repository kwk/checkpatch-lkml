CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/mtrr.h:56:
+extern void set_mtrr_ops(struct mtrr_ops *ops);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct mtrr_ops should normally be const
#78: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/mtrr.h:56:
+extern void set_mtrr_ops(struct mtrr_ops *ops);

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
