Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#100: FILE: fs/select.c:676:
+		if (copy_from_user(walk->entries, ufds + nfds-todo,
+					sizeof(struct pollfd) * walk->len))

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#113: FILE: fs/select.c:685:
+		walk = walk->next = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#157: FILE: fs/select.c:712:
+		struct poll_list *pos = walk;
+		walk = walk->next;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
