CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "s"
#241: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-trace.c:191:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#310: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-trace.c:260:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const char *' should also have an identifier name
#465: FILE: tools/perf/util/trace-event.h:264:

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
