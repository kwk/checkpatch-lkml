CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#44: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:82:
+extern void kobject_init_ng(struct kobject *kobj, struct kobj_type *ktype);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
