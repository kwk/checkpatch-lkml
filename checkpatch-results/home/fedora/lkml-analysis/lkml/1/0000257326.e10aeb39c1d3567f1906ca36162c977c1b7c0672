WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'walk', this function's name, in a string
#92: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1336:
+	xen_raw_printk("walk %p, %lx -> %d %d %d %d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#122: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1366:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

#131: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1375:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
