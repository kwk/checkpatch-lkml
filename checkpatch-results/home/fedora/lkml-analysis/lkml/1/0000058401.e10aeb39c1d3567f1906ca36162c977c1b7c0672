The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#85: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/calls.S:400:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
