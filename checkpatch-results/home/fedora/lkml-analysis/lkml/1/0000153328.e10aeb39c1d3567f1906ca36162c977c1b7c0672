CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#193: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:312:
+extern void perf_counter_output(struct perf_counter *counter,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#216: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1367:
+		u64 *p = (u64 *) &irqdata->data[irqdata->len];

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#252: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1403:
+	if (nmi) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
