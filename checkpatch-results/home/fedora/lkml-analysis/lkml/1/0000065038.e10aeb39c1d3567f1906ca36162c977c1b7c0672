2.6.31-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tty->driver->termios[idx]"
#71: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:186:
+	if (tty->driver->termios[idx] == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#130: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:334:
+	struct usb_serial_port *port = tty->driver_data;
+	serial_do_down(port);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#133: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:337:
+	/* We must not free port yet - the USB serial layer depends on it's
+	   continued existence */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
