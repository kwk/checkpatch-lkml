Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#130: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:308:
+		struct sym_entry *syme = dso__sym_priv(self, sym);
+		syme->skip = 1;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!self"
#156: FILE: tools/perf/util/strlist.c:110:
+	if (self == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
