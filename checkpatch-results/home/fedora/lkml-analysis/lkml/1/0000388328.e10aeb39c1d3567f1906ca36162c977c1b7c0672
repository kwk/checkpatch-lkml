WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#60: FILE: drivers/char/drm/i915_dma.c:510:
+				OUT_RING(MI_BATCH_BUFFER_START | (2 << 6) | MI_BATCH_NON_SECURE_I965);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

                                    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#87: FILE: drivers/char/drm/i915_drv.h:283:
+#define MI_BATCH_NON_SECURE_I965 (1<<8)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
