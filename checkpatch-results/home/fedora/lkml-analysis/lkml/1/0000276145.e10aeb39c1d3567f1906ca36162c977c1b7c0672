WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#107: FILE: drivers/base/firmware_class.c:54:
+extern struct builtin_fw __end_builtin_fw[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#109: FILE: drivers/base/firmware_class.c:56:
+static struct builtin_fw *__start_builtin_fw = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#158: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#231: FILE: include/linux/firmware.h:26:
+/* We have to play tricks here much like stringify() to get the
+   __COUNTER__ macro to be expanded as we want it */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
