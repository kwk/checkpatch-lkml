WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#97: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1502:
+	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(&this_rq->lock));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#97: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1502:
+	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(&this_rq->lock));

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/locking/lockdep-design.html#annotations

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#194: FILE: kernel/sched_rt.c:107:
+	if (likely (rq->rt_nr_running < 2))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'rq->rt_nr_running < 2'
#194: FILE: kernel/sched_rt.c:107:
+	if (likely (rq->rt_nr_running < 2))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#211: FILE: kernel/sched_rt.c:124:
+	idx = find_next_bit(array->bitmap, MAX_RT_PRIO, idx+1);
 	                                                   ^

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#222: FILE: kernel/sched_rt.c:135:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#223: FILE: kernel/sched_rt.c:136:
+	
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
