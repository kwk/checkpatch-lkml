WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#66: FILE: drivers/power/ds2760_battery.c:582:
+static struct dev_pm_ops ds2760_battery_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
