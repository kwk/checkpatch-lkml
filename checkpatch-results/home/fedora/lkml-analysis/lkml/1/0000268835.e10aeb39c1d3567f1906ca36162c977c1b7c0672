CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#217: FILE: drivers/net/forcedeth.c:3278:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <NvRegMSIIrqMask>
#224: FILE: drivers/net/forcedeth.c:3285:
+		writel(0, base + NvRegMSIIrqMask);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

#396: FILE: drivers/net/virtio_net.c:248:
+ * are consumed, we fall back to using this function on a timer to free them. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

+		QETH_DBF_MESSAGE(2, "qeth_osn_send_control_data: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
