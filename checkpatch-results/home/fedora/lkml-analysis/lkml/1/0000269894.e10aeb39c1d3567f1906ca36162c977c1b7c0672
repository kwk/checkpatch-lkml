ERROR:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Unrecognized email address: 'Vegard Nossum <vegard.nossum@gmail.com'
#51:

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#290: FILE: scripts/Makefile.headersinst:80:
+hdr-inst := -rR -f $(srctree)/scripts/Makefile.headersinst obj

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#316: 
deleted file mode 100755

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.
