WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct hw_breakpoint *' should also have an identifier name
#215: FILE: include/asm-generic/hw_breakpoint.h:169:

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

#380: FILE: kernel/hw_breakpoint.c:88:
+		list_for_each_entry_rcu(bp, &thbi->thread_bps, node) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

constructs like::
