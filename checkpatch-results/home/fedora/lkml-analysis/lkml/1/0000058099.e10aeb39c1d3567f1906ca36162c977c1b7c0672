> >I added a function mtrr_add_unaligned() that tries to create as many MTRR

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#119: FILE: arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c:274:
+		void __iomem *ret = ioremap_nocache(phys_addr, size);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#162: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mtrr.h:119:
+extern void mtrr_add_unaligned(unsigned long base, unsigned long size,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ot' may be misspelled - perhaps 'to'?
#194: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:496:
+	// round down size to next power ot two
 	                                 ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#198: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:500:
+	ptr1 = ptr2 = (base + size - 1) & ~(size - 1);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: struct mutex definition without comment

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct kobject *' should also have an identifier name
#381: FILE: include/linux/sysfs.h:87:
+	int (*release)(struct kobject *, struct bin_attribute *attr,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#382: FILE: include/linux/sysfs.h:88:
+	int (*release)(struct kobject *, struct bin_attribute *attr,
+		      struct file *file);
