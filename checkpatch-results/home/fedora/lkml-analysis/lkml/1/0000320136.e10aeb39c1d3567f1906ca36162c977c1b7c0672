Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#390: FILE: fs/unionfs/union.h:355:
+extern int unionfs_file_revalidate_locked(struct file *file, bool willwrite);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
