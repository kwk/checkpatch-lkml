#56: 
POWERMISC register is created and the state of PWGTxEN bits is stored in memory.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#77: FILE: drivers/regulator/mc13783-regulator.c:86:
+#define MC13783_REG_POWERMISC_PWGT1SPIEN		(1 << 15)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct regulator_ops should normally be const
#87: FILE: drivers/regulator/mc13783-regulator.c:170:
+static struct regulator_ops mc13783_regulator_ops_gpo;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#119: FILE: drivers/regulator/mc13783-regulator.c:461:
+	BUG_ON(val & ~mask);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
