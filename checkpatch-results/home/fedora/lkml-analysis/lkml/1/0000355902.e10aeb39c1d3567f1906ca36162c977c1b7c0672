CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#118: FILE: net/ipv4/ipcomp.c:341:
+	pos->tfms = tfms = CPU_ALLOC(struct crypto_comp *, GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
