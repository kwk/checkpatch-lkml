CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#145: FILE: fs/nilfs2/file.c:103:
+		bh = head = page_buffers(page);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
