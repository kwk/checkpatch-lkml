WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct platform_suspend_ops should normally be const
#66: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:112:
+static inline void suspend_set_ops(struct platform_suspend_ops *ops) {}

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#67: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:113:
+static inline int pm_suspend(suspend_state_t state) { return -ENOSYS; }

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
