CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c:963:
+			res->start = res->end = ret;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#101: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c:971:

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#161: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c:1002:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#170: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c:1011:
+			int irq = res->start;
+			if (irq == 2)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
