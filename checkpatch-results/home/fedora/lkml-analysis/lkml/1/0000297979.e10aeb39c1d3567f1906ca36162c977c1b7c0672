CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#111: FILE: fs/devpts/inode.c:61:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'simlar' may be misspelled - perhaps 'similar'?
#163: FILE: fs/devpts/inode.c:192:
+	/* hereafter we're very simlar to get_sb_nodev */
 	                        ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#220: FILE: fs/devpts/inode.c:246:
+	if (!idr_pre_get(&pts_ns->allocated_ptys, GFP_KERNEL)) {
 		return -ENOMEM;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
