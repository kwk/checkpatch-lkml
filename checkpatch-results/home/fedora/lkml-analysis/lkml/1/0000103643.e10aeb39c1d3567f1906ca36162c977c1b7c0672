WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#83: FILE: drivers/staging/rtl8187se/r8180_core.c:3866:
 	if( CheckTxPwrTracking((struct net_device *)data));
 		TxPwrTracking87SE((struct net_device *)data);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
