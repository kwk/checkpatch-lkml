CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#45: FILE: fs/ext2/symlink.c:27:
+	char *link = (char *) ei->i_data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#46: FILE: fs/ext2/symlink.c:28:
+	char *link = (char *) ei->i_data;
+	link[sizeof(ei->i_data) - 1] = '\0';

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#47: FILE: fs/ext2/symlink.c:29:
+	nd_set_link(nd, link);
