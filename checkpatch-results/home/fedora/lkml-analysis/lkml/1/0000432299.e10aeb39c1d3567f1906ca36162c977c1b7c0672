Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#46: FILE: fs/eventpoll.c:2:
+ *  fs/eventpoll.c (Efficent event polling implementation)

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
