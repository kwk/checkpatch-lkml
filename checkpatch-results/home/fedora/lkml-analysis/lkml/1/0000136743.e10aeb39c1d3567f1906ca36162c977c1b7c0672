#35: 
initialization of the console device. When this occurs, opening /dev/console

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#168: FILE: kernel/printk.c:213:
+		console_delay = simple_strtoul(str, NULL, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#182: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1106:
+	 * for some number of milliseconds if console_delay=msec is used */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#183: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1107:
+	if (console_delay == CONSOLE_DELAY_FOREVER)
[...]
+	else if (wait_event_timeout(console_wq, preferred_console >= 0,
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#187: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1111:
+	else if (wait_event_timeout(console_wq, preferred_console >= 0,
+		msecs_to_jiffies(console_delay)) == 0) {

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#191: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1115:
+		pr_info("Increase boot parameter console_delay to wait "
+			"longer\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
