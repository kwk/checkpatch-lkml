CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:248:
+extern int runqueue_is_locked(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#134: FILE: kernel/sched.c:637:
+	ret = spin_is_locked(&rq->lock);

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
