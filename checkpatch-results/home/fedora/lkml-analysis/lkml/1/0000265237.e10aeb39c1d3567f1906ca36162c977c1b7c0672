CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "portp->port.tty"
#50: FILE: drivers/char/istallion.c:738:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#146: FILE: drivers/char/istallion.c:942:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
