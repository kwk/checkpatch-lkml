WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#81: FILE: drivers/video/atmel_lcdfb.c:92:
+		if ((lcdcon2 & ATMEL_LCDC_DISTYPE) == ATMEL_LCDC_DISTYPE_STNCOLOR) {
+			value *= 3;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
