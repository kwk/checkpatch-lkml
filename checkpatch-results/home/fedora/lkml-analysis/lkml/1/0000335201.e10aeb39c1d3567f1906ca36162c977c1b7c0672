CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*fp)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ocfs2_file_private)...)
#88: FILE: fs/ocfs2/file.c:71:
+	fp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ocfs2_file_private), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
