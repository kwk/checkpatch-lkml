CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#66: FILE: arch/blackfin/kernel/setup.c:582:
+		uclinux_ram_map.phys = memory_mtd_start = memory_end;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'parition' may be misspelled - perhaps 'partition'?
#68: FILE: arch/blackfin/kernel/setup.c:584:
+		pr_info("Found mtd parition at 0x%p, (len=0x%lx), moving to 0x%p\n",
 		                   ^^^^^^^^
