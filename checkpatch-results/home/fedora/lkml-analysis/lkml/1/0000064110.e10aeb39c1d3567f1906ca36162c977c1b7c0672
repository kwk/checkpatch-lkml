WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'envrionment' may be misspelled - perhaps 'environment'?
#116: 
Doh, this daemon has overwritten envrionment string area.
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#218: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:291:
+	else if (res > 0 && buffer[res-1] != '\0' && len < PAGE_SIZE) {
 	                              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#235: FILE: include/linux/prctl.h:91:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#260: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1543:
+			if (!access_ok(VERIFY_READ, addr, len)) {
+				return -EFAULT;
+			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
