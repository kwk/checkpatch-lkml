WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#96: FILE: mm/debug-pagealloc.c:1:
+#include <linux/kernel.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#163: FILE: mm/debug-pagealloc.c:68:
+	BUG_ON(PageHighMem(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#192: FILE: mm/Kconfig.debug:1:
+config PAGE_POISONING
+	bool "Debug page memory allocations"
+	depends on !ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
+	select DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
+	help
+	   Fill the pages with poison patterns after free_pages() and verify
+	   the patterns before alloc_pages(). This results in a large slowdown,
+	   but helps to find certain types of memory corruptions.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
