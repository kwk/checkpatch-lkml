#29: 
Move the SLAB struct kmem_cache definition to <linux/slab_def.h> like with SLUB

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct kmem_cache *' should also have an identifier name
#85: FILE: include/linux/slab_def.h:53:
+	void (*ctor)(struct kmem_cache *, void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
