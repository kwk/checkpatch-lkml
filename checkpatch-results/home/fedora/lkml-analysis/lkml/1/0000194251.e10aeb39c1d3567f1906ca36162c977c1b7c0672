CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#143: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:28:
+extern void __cpuset_update_task_memory_state(bool locked);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#145: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:30:
+static void inline cpuset_update_task_memory_state(void)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#150: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:35:
