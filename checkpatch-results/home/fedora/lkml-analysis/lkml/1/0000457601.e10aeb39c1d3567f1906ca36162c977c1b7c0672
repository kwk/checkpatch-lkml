WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#73: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-max6900.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#108: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-max6900.c:36:
+#define MAX6900_REG_CT_WP		(1 << 7)	/* Write Protect */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*client)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_client)...)
#325: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-max6900.c:253:
+	client = kzalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_client), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!client"
#326: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-max6900.c:254:
+	if (client == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
