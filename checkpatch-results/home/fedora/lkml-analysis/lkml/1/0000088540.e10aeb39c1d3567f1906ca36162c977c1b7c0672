WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'unusre' may be misspelled - perhaps 'unsure'?

+	  If unusre, say Y.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#105: FILE: sound/sound_core.c:133:
+static int preclaim_oss = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#113: FILE: sound/sound_core.c:141:
+static const struct file_operations soundcore_fops =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
