The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#62: FILE: drivers/edac/amd8131_edac.c:20:
+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

ERROR:DATE_TIME: Use of the '__DATE__' macro makes the build non-deterministic
#78: FILE: drivers/edac/amd8131_edac.c:36:
+#define AMD8131_EDAC_REVISION	" Ver: 1.0.0 " __DATE__

It is generally desirable that building the same source code with
the same set of tools is reproducible, i.e. the output is always
exactly the same.

The kernel does *not* use the ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros,
and enables warnings if they are used as they can lead to
non-deterministic builds.
