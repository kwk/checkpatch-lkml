#40: 
Support Alternative Routing-ID Interpretation (ARI), which increases the number of functions that can be supported by a PCIe endpoint. ARI is required by SR-IOV.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#67: FILE: drivers/pci/Kconfig:54:
+config PCI_ARI
+	bool "PCI ARI support"
+	depends on PCI
+	default n
+	help
+	  This enables PCI Alternative Routing-ID Interpretation.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#84: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#89: FILE: drivers/pci/ari.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#90: FILE: drivers/pci/ari.c:2:
+ * drivers/pci/ari.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#170: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:152:
+extern void pci_ari_enable_fwd(struct pci_dev *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#218: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:1153:

+extern int pci_ari_next_fn(struct pci_dev *dev);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
