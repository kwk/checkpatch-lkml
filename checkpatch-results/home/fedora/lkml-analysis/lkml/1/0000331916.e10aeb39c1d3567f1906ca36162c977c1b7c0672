Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#99: FILE: include/linux/device.h:159:
+extern int __must_check driver_add_kobj(struct device_driver *drv,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
