time delay a fixed sized field so we don't get 32/64bit problems. Add the ioctls

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#79: FILE: include/linux/serial.h:185:
+#define SER_RS485_ENABLED		(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

#84: FILE: include/linux/serial.h:190:
+	__u32	padding[6];		/* Memory is cheap, new structs

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
