WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#73: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1513:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#96: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1713:
+		struct physdev_set_iopl set_iopl;
+		set_iopl.iopl = 1;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
