ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#71: FILE: arch/blackfin/mach-common/ints-priority-sc.c:363:
+	if (type & (IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING | IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING |

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
