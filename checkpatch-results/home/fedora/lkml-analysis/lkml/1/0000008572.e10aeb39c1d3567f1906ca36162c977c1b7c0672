CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#226: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic/io_apic.c:1036:
+			i = irq = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#242: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic/io_apic.c:1482:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
