#38: 
Subject: [PATCH] async: allow for multiple independent synchronization domains

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#64: FILE: include/linux/async.h:20:
+extern async_cookie_t async_schedule_special(async_func_ptr *ptr, void *data, struct list_head *list);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#64: FILE: include/linux/async.h:20:
+extern async_cookie_t async_schedule_special(async_func_ptr *ptr, void *data, struct list_head *list);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
