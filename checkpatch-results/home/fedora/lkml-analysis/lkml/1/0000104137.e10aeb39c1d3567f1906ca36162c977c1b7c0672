WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#74: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-tmff.c:240:
+	{ HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_THRUSTMASTER, 0xb304),	/* FireStorm Dual Power 2 (and 3)
+		.driver_data = (unsigned long)ff_rumble },

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
