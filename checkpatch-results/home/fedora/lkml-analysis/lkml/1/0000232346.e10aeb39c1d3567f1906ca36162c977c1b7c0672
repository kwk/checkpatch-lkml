WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#58: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common_64.c:98:
+	/* Intel chips right-justify this string for some dumb reason;
+	   undo that brain damage */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#59: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common_64.c:99:
+	p = q = &c->x86_model_id[0];

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
