CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#66: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv_core.c:152:
+	if (e_info->id == ((dev->bus->number << 8) | dev->devfn)) {
[...]
-			pci_read_config_byte(dev, PCI_SECONDARY_BUS,
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!e_info"
#215: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv_core.c:703:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!e_info->dev"
#246: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv_core.c:732:
