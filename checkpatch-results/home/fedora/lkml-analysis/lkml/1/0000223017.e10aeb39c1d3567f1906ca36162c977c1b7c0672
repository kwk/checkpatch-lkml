CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#268: FILE: include/asm-x86/topology.h:197:
+extern const_cpumask_t cpu_coregroup_map(int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#279: FILE: include/asm-x86/uv/uv_bau.h:328:

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'cpumask_t' should also have an identifier name
#279: FILE: include/asm-x86/uv/uv_bau.h:328:
+extern int uv_flush_tlb_others(cpumask_t, struct mm_struct *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
