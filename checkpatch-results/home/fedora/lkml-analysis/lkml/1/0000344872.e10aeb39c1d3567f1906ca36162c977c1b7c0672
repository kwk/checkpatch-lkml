#31: 
view of register state, compatible with what a CONFIG_PPC32 kernel provides.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!target->thread.regs"
#61: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace.c:517:
+	if (target->thread.regs == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#74: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace.c:530:
+			if (__put_user((compat_ulong_t) regs[pos++], u++))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
