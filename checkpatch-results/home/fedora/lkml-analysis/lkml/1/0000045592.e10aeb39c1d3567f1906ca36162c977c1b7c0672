CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1855:
+extern int force_cpus_allowed(struct task_struct *p,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#50: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1856:
+extern int force_cpus_allowed(struct task_struct *p,
+				  const struct cpumask *new_mask);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#58: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1865:
 }
+static inline int force_cpus_allowed(struct task_struct *p,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
