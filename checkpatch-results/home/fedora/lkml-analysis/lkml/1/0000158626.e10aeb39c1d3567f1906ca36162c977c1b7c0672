#32: 
This patch adds a module parameter, defaulting to off, that swaps these keys.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#53: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-apple.c:43:
+static unsigned int swapmodifiers = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#56: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-apple.c:46:
+MODULE_PARM_DESC(fnmode, "Modifiers match labels or positions "
+		 "([0] = labels, 1 = positions)");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
