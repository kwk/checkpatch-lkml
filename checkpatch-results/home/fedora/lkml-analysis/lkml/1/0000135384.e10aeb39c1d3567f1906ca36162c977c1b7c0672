             ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#65: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:1468:
+		struct gfs2_dinode *di = (struct gfs2_dinode *)dibh->b_data;
+		gfs2_trans_add_bh(ip->i_gl, dibh, 1);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#66: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:1469:
+		di->di_goal_meta = di->di_goal_data = cpu_to_be64(ip->i_goal);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
