#37: 
Introduce CONFIG_SUSPEND representing the ability to enter system sleep states,

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#245: FILE: include/linux/pm.h:201:
+static inline int pm_suspend(suspend_state_t state) { return -ENOSYS; }

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after acpisleep_dmi_table[]
#646: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/main.c:199:
+static struct dmi_system_id __initdata acpisleep_dmi_table[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#752: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/sleep.h:10:
+extern int acpi_sleep_prepare(u32 acpi_state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
