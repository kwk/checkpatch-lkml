      ide: never called printk statement in ide-taskfile.c::wait_drive_not_busy

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#108: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:250:
+		if ((stat = hwif->INB(IDE_STATUS_REG)) & BUSY_STAT)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#109: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:251:
+			udelay(10);

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#150: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c		Version 1.06	Jun 27, 2007

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#175: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1523:
+	d->enablebits[0].mask = d->enablebits[0].val = 0x10;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
