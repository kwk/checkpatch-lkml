Subject: [PATCH 06/11] microblaze: Remove sparse error in traps.c

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#52: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/traps.c:37:
+	kstack_depth_to_print = strict_strtoul(s, 0, NULL);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
