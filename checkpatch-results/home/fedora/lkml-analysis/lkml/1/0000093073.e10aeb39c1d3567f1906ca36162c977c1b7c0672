ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#46: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:464:
+static void walk_vma_area(struct mm_walk *this_walk, struct $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#47: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:464:
vm_area_struct *vma,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#90: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:506:
+	type = simple_strtol(buffer, &end, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
