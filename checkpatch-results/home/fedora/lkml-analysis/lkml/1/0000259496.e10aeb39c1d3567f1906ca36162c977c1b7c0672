CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#67: FILE: block/genhd.c:29:
+#define MAX_EXT_DEVT		(1 << MINORBITS)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#235: FILE: block/genhd.c:840:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(alloc_disk_ext_node);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#293: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:555:
+extern int blk_alloc_devt(struct hd_struct *part, gfp_t gfp_mask, dev_t *devt);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
