CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#169: FILE: include/linux/hardirq.h:153:
+extern void rcu_enter_nohz(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
