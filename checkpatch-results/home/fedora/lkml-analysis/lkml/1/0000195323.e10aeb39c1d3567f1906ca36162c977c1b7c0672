WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'init_board_info', this function's name, in a string
#109: FILE: drivers/staging/me4000/me4000.c:669:
+		       "ME4000:init_board_info():Cannot get index of board\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
