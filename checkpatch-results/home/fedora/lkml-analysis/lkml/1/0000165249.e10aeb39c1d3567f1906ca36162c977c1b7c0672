Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#103: FILE: fs/ext4/balloc.c:365:
+void ext4_add_groupblocks(handle_t *handle, struct super_block *sb,
+			 ext4_fsblk_t block, unsigned long count)

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around grp->bb_state
#285: FILE: fs/ext4/balloc.c:469:
+	set_bit(EXT4_GROUP_INFO_NEED_INIT_BIT, &(grp->bb_state));

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#300: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1012:
+extern void ext4_add_groupblocks(handle_t *handle, struct super_block *sb,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#301: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1013:
+extern void ext4_add_groupblocks(handle_t *handle, struct super_block *sb,
