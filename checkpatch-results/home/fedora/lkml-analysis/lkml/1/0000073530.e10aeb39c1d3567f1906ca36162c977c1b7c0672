CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/i387.h:29:
+extern void __math_state_restore(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#103: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/process_32.c:409:
+	/* If we're going to preload the fpu context, make sure clts
+	   is run while we're batching the cpu state updates. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
