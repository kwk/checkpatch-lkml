ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#250: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/processor.h:327:
+extern long create_async_thread(long (*fn)(void *), void * arg, unsigned long flags);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#250: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/processor.h:327:
+extern long create_async_thread(long (*fn)(void *), void * arg, unsigned long flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#267: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/processor.h:347:
+#define set_task_stack_reg(t, new_stack)	\
+		do { task_pt_regs(t)->rsp = (new_stack); } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
