Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*action)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct irqaction)...)
#274: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:674:
+	action = kzalloc(sizeof(struct irqaction), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
