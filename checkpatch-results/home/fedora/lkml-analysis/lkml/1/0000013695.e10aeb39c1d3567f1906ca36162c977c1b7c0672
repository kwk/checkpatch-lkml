WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#43: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-pwm.c:2:
+ * drivers/leds/leds-pwm.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#66: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-pwm.c:19:
+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#119: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-pwm.c:57:
+	struct led_pwm *led = to_led_pwm(c);
+	return led->percent;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#318: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#323: FILE: include/linux/pwm/pwm-led.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.
