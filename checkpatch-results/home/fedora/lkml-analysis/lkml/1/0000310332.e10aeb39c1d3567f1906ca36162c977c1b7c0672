CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#149: FILE: drivers/base/power/main.c:77:
+			dev_warn(dev,
+				"parent %s is sleeping, will not add\n",

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#260: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:14:
+extern int device_pm_add(struct device *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <PMError>
#301: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:821:
+		goto PMError;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
