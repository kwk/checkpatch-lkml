WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct backlight_ops should normally be const
#47: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/omap1_bl.c:128:
+static struct backlight_ops omapbl_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct fb_info *' should also have an identifier name
#60: FILE: include/linux/backlight.h:50:
+	int (*check_fb)(struct fb_info *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
