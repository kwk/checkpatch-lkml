CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#80: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1875:
+extern unsigned long wait_task_inactive(struct task_struct *, long match_state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
