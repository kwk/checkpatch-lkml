WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rcu_torture_writer', this function's name, in a string
#173: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:649:
+		printk(KERN_ALERT "rcu_torture_writer() priority err: %d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#182: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:883:
+^I        "npreempthogs=%d "$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

#182: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:883:
 		"--- %s: nreaders=%d nfakewriters=%d "
+	        "npreempthogs=%d "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

#217: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:1042:
+		fakewriter_tasks[i] = kthread_run(rcu_torture_fakewriter, (void*)i,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
