CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#50: FILE: drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:374:
+	if (match[len-1] == '\n')

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#78: FILE: drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:402:
+	status = strict_strtol(buf, 0, &gpio);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#79: FILE: drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:403:
+	if (status < 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
