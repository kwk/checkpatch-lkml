CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#59: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mce.h:12:
+#define MCG_CTL_P		(1ULL<<8)    /* MCG_CTL register available */
                  		     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT_ULL macro
#59: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/mce.h:12:
+#define MCG_CTL_P		(1ULL<<8)    /* MCG_CTL register available */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
