The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
