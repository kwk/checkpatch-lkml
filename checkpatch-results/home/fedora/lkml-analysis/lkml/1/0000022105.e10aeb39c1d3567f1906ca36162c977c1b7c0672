WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#79: FILE: include/trace/events/scsi.h:1:
+#undef TRACE_SYSTEM

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct trace_seq*' should also have an identifier name
#265: FILE: include/trace/events/scsi.h:187:
+const char *scsi_trace_parse_cdb(struct trace_seq*, unsigned char*, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
