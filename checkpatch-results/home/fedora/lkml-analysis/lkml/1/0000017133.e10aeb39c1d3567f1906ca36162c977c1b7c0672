CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#122: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:313:
+extern void touch_softlockup_watchdog_sync(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#130: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:327:
 }
+static inline void touch_softlockup_watchdog_sync(void)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
