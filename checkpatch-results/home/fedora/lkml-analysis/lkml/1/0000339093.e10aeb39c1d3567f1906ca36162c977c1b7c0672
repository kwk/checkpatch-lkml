WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#45: FILE: security/tomoyo/audit.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#46: FILE: security/tomoyo/audit.c:2:
+ * security/tomoyo/audit.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#70: FILE: security/tomoyo/audit.c:26:
+	char *cp;
+	ab = audit_log_start(current->audit_context, GFP_KERNEL, AUDIT_KERNEL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited before semicolon
#93: FILE: security/tomoyo/audit.c:49:
+out: ;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
