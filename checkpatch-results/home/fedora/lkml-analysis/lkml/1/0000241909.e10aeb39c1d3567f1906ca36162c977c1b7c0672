WARNING:BAD_STABLE_ADDRESS_STYLE: Invalid email format for stable: 'Stable <stable@kernel.org>', prefer 'stable@kernel.org'

Cc: Stable <stable@kernel.org>

The email format for stable is incorrect.
Some valid options for stable address are::

  1. stable@vger.kernel.org
  2. stable@kernel.org

For adding version info, the following comment style should be used::

  stable@vger.kernel.org # version info

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#84: FILE: include/net/addrconf.h:83:
+extern int			ipv6_get_saddr(struct dst_entry *dst,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#113: FILE: net/ipv6/addrconf.c:1243:
+int ipv6_get_saddr(struct dst_entry *dst, const struct in6_addr *daddr,
+		    unsigned int srcprefs, struct in6_addr *saddr)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#116: FILE: net/ipv6/addrconf.c:1246:
+	struct inet6_dev *idev = ip6_dst_idev(dst);
+	return ipv6_dev_get_saddr(idev ? idev->dev : NULL, daddr, srcprefs, saddr);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#118: FILE: net/ipv6/addrconf.c:1248:

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
