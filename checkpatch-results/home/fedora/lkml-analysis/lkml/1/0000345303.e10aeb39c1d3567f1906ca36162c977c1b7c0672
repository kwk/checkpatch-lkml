WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'shouldnt' may be misspelled - perhaps 'shouldn't'?
#87: 
Also, shouldnt we perhaps increase DMI_MAX_DATA from 2K to 4K?
      ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: static char array declaration should probably be static const char
#140: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:11:
+static char dmi_empty_string[] = "        ";

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#150: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:26:
+			size_t len = strlen(bp)+1;
 			                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#160: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:35:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "dmi_string: cannot allocate %Zu bytes.\n", len);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dmi_string', this function's name, in a string
#160: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:35:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "dmi_string: cannot allocate %Zu bytes.\n", len);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:PRINTF_Z: %Zu is non-standard C, use %zu
#160: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:35:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "dmi_string: cannot allocate %Zu bytes.\n", len);

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
