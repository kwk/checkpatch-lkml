CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/early_printk.h:26:
+extern void enable_shadow_console(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#81: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#86: FILE: arch/blackfin/kernel/shadow_console.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#113: FILE: arch/blackfin/kernel/shadow_console.c:28:
+static __init void early_shadow_write(struct console *con, const char *s,
+				unsigned int n)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#119: FILE: arch/blackfin/kernel/shadow_console.c:34:
+	if ((shadow_console_buffer + n) <= (char *)(SHADOW_CONSOLE_END - 2)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#124: FILE: arch/blackfin/kernel/shadow_console.c:39:
+	} else

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after early_shadow_console
#128: FILE: arch/blackfin/kernel/shadow_console.c:43:
+static __initdata struct console early_shadow_console = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
