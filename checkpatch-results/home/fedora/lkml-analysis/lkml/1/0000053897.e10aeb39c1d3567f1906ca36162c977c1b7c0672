Subject: [PATCH 08/10] fanotify: sys_fanotify_mark declartion
                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#106: FILE: fs/notify/fanotify/fanotify_user.c:77:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
