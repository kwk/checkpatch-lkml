WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#109: FILE: drivers/serial/sc26xx.c:115:
+#define MR0_WATCHDOG	(1 << 7)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#110: FILE: drivers/serial/sc26xx.c:116:
+#define MR0_RXINT2	(1 << 6)

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#112: FILE: drivers/serial/sc26xx.c:118:
+#define MR0_FIFO_SIZE	(1 << 3)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#115: FILE: drivers/serial/sc26xx.c:121:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#228: FILE: drivers/serial/sc26xx.c:507:
+		dev_warn(up->port[0].dev,
+			"%d baud not available using %d\n",

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#352: FILE: drivers/serial/sc26xx.c:775:
+	 * will return same data.*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <MRx>
#357: FILE: drivers/serial/sc26xx.c:780:
+		mrx[i] = READ_SC_PORT(port, MRx);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
