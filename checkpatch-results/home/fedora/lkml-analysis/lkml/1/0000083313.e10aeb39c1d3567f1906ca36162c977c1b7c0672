The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#165: FILE: fs/sysfs/xattr.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
