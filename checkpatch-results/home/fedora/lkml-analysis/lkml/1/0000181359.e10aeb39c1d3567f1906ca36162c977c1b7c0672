WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#85:

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around function pointer (tsf->next->api->clear)
#148: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/ts_filter_group.c:59:
+		(tsf->next->api->clear)(tsf->next);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#157: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/ts_filter_group.c:68:
+	BUG_ON((count_coords < 1) || (count_coords > MAX_TS_FILTER_COORDS));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*tsfg)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ts_filter_group)...)
#159: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/ts_filter_group.c:70:
+	tsfg = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ts_filter_group), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

#183: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/ts_filter_group.c:94:

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
