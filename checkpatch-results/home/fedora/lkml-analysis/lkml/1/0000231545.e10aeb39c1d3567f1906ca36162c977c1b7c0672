WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#229: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.h:224:
+	int (*set_state)(struct dvb_frontend *fe, enum tuner_param param, struct tuner_state *state);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#274: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.h:344:
+extern void decode_dvbs2_modcod(u32 modcod,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
