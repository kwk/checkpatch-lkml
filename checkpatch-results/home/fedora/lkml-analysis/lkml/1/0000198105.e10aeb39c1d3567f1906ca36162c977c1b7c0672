WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#75: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:839:
+#define GEN_RELEASE_EVENT \
+	int i; \
+\
+	if (atkbd->set == 2) \
+		for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(forced_release_keys); i++) \
+			__set_bit(forced_release_keys[i], \
+				atkbd->force_release_mask);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I^I^IDMI_MATCH(DMI_SYS_VENDOR, "FUJITSU SIEMENS"), $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
