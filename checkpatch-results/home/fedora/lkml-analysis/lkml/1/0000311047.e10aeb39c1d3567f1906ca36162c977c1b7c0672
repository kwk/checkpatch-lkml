CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#138: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:374:
+extern struct gendisk *get_gendisk(dev_t dev, mode_t *mode, int *part);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct kobj_map *' should also have an identifier name
#151: FILE: include/linux/kobj_map.h:11:
+struct kobject *kobj_lookup(struct kobj_map *, dev_t, mode_t *, int *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'dev_t' should also have an identifier name
