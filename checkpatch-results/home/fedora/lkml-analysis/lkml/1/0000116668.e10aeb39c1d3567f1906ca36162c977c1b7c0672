WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#74: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-record.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#85: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-record.c:33:
+static int			append_file			= 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#107: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-record.c:402:
+		fprintf(stderr, "Error, output file %s exists, use -A to append or -f to overwrite.\n",

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#113: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-record.c:407:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0600'.
#119: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-record.c:413:
+	output = open(output_name, flags, S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
