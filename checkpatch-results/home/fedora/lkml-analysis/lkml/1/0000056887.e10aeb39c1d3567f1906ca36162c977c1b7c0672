CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p->mapping"
#156: FILE: mm/memory-failure.c:792:
+	if ((lru_flag & lru) && !PageSwapCache(p) && p->mapping == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '&' (ctx:VxW)
#165: FILE: mm/memory-failure.c:800:
+		if (((p->flags | lru_flag)& ps->mask) == ps->res) {
 		                          ^
