Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "x86_pmu.enable_bts"
#140: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_counter.c:701:
+	return x86_pmu.enable_bts != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'event ==
 		      x86_pmu.event_map(PERF_COUNT_HW_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS)'
#391: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_counter.c:1302:
+	if (unlikely((event ==
+		      x86_pmu.event_map(PERF_COUNT_HW_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS)) &&
+		     (hwc->sample_period == 1)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'hwc->sample_period == 1'
#391: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_counter.c:1302:
+	if (unlikely((event ==
+		      x86_pmu.event_map(PERF_COUNT_HW_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS)) &&
+		     (hwc->sample_period == 1)))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#541: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:684:
+extern void perf_counter_output(struct perf_counter *counter, int nmi,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#564: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:2611:
+void perf_counter_output(struct perf_counter *counter, int nmi,
 				struct perf_sample_data *data)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#605: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/perf_counter.h:96:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
