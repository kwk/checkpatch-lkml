#41: 
This also cures the problem of multiple per-UID keyrings sometimes appearing

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#119: FILE: kernel/user.c:392:
+		new->uid_keyring = new->session_keyring = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#156: FILE: security/keys/internal.h:103:
+extern struct key *find_keyring_by_name(const char *name, bool skip_perm_check);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+/* Keyring handling

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#381: FILE: security/keys/process_keys.c:64:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
