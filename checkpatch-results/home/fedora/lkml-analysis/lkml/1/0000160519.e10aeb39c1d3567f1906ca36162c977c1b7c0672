WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#71: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#76: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/zylonite-wm97xx.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'sp' may be better as '(sp)' to avoid precedence issues
#116: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/zylonite-wm97xx.c:41:
+#define WM_READS(sp) ((sp / HZ) + 1)

ERROR:NON_OCTAL_PERMISSIONS: Use 4 digit octal (0777) not decimal permissions
#142: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/zylonite-wm97xx.c:67:
+module_param(pressure, int, 1);
Permission bits should use 4 digit octal permissions (like 0700 or 0444).
Avoid using any other base like decimal.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#154: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/zylonite-wm97xx.c:79:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#159: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/zylonite-wm97xx.c:84:
+	int count = 16;
+	schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1);

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'threashold' may be misspelled - perhaps 'threshold'?
#175: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/zylonite-wm97xx.c:100:
+	 * threashold set to use the notifications it gives.
 	   ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!wm->ac97"
#220: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/zylonite-wm97xx.c:145:
+	if (wm->ac97 == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
