#34: 
Many networking drivers have issues with the use of the NETIF_F_HIGHDMA flag.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#1104: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:767:
+#define NETIF_F_DMA_64BIT	(1 << 28) /* 64-bit DMA support */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#1143: FILE: net/core/dev.c:1789:
+	/* Note that these checks are skipped if CONFIG_HIGHMEM is not set.
+	   In that case, the PageHighMem check is obviously not applicable,

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
