WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#122: FILE: drivers/xen/events.c:671:
+	   so there should be a proper type */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#123: FILE: drivers/xen/events.c:672:
+	BUG_ON(info->type != IRQT_UNBOUND);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
