#32: 
track how many channels they need and dmaengine will learn if the client cares about

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#88: FILE: drivers/dma/dmaengine.c:109:
+	if (unlikely(chan->slow_ref) && atomic_read(&chan->refcount.refcount) > 1)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
