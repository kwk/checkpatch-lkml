#28: 
The patch moved PIT from userspace to kernel, and increase the timer accuracy greatly.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#59: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
