Subject: [PATCH 2/2] moxa: fix sparse warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#49: FILE: drivers/char/moxa.c:873:
+			if ((tp = ch->tty) == NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <chkPort>
#58: FILE: drivers/char/moxa.c:2037:
+	if (moxa_ports[port].chkPort == 0 || termio == NULL)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!termio"
#58: FILE: drivers/char/moxa.c:2037:
+	if (moxa_ports[port].chkPort == 0 || termio == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
