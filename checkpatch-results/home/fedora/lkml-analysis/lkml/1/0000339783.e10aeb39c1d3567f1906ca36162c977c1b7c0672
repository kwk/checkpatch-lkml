CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#89: FILE: include/linux/rcupreempt_trace.h:135:
+extern int read_rcu_boost_prio(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#121: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt_trace.c:73:
+static struct preempt_rcu_boost_probe preempt_rcu_boost_probe_array[] =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#235: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt_trace.c:187:
+static struct file_operations rcuboost_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
