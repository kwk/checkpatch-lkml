WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'gdth_halt', this function's name, in a string
#213: FILE: drivers/scsi/gdth.c:5135:
+	TRACE2(("gdth_halt() event %d\n",(int)event));

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - void gdth_shutdown() should probably be void gdth_shutdown(void)
#226: FILE: drivers/scsi/gdth.c:5148:
+static void gdth_shutdown()

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#229: FILE: drivers/scsi/gdth.c:5151:

+	if (gdth_shutdown_done)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
