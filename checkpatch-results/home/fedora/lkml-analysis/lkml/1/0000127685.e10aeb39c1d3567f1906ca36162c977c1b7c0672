CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:283:
+extern void kgdb_msg_write(const char *s, int len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 8)
