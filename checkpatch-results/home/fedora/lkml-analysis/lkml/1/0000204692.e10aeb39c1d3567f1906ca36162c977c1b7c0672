WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#248: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2729:
+				int r;
+				cnt = ret;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#253: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2734:
+					 * size max buffer!!!! */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
