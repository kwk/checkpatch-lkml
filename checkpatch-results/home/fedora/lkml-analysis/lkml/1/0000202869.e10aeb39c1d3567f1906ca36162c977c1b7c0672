WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#41: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#46: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/virtext.h:1:
+/* CPU virtualization extensions handling

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#63: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/virtext.h:18:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#73: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/virtext.h:28:
+	unsigned long ecx = cpuid_ecx(1);
+	return test_bit(5, &ecx); /* CPUID.1:ECX.VMX[bit 5] -> VT */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
