The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#74: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2564:
+	if (deadline_task(p)) {
[...]
+		p->dl.flags |=3D DL_THROTTLED;
[...]
+		p->sched_class =3D &rt_sched_class;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
