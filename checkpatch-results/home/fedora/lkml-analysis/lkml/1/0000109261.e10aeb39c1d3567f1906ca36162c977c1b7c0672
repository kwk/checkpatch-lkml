WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns
#71: FILE: arch/x86/vdso/vdso-layout.lds.S:100:
+ASSERT(!SIZEOF(.broken), "The vdso linker script found a section that is bad. See vdso-layout.lds.S for details.");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
