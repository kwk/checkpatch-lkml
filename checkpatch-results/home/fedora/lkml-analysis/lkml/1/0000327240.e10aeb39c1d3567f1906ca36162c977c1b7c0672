CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#92: FILE: drivers/firewire/fw-sbp2.c:699:
+	struct Scsi_Host *shost;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#153: FILE: drivers/firewire/fw-sbp2.c:878:
 					  "management ORB timeout, limiting "
+					  "to %ds\n", tgt->bus_id,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'sbp2_scsi_abort', this function's name, in a string
#234: FILE: drivers/firewire/fw-sbp2.c:1380:
+	fw_notify("%s: sbp2_scsi_abort\n", lu->tgt->bus_id);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
