Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#100: FILE: mkfs.c:165:
+			next = p+1;
 			        ^

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'param->sectorsize == 0'
#113: FILE: mkfs.c:178:
+			if (*p || (param->sectorsize == 0)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#127: FILE: mkfs.c:192:
+			"Extended options are separated by commas, "
+			"and may take an argument which\n"

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 124 exceeds 100 columns
#138: FILE: mkfs.c:202:
+	fprintf(stderr, "usage: mkfs.btrfs [ -l leafsize ] [ -n nodesize] [ -E sectorsize=<sectorsize> ] dev [ blocks ]\n");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#168: FILE: mkfs.c:247:
+				memset(&fs_params, 0,
+					sizeof(struct btrfs_params));
