#48: 
First off, I hate to admit that my e-mail application broke the patch I sent in the first message in this thread. I am reposting the patch now in the hope that it'll get through intact.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'te' may be misspelled - perhaps 'the'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.
