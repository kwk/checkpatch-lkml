#35: 
This patch adds the functions to parse the information about IOMMU exclusion

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!e"
#89: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu_init.c:597:
+	if (e == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#95: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu_init.c:603:
+		e->devid_start = e->devid_end = m->devid;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
