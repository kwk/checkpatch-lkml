CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#80: FILE: include/linux/rcutree.h:79:
+extern void synchronize_rcu_expedited(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#94: FILE: kernel/futex.c:154:
+	return (key1 && key2
+		&& key1->both.word == key2->both.word

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#218: FILE: kernel/rcutree.c:1028:
+	if (rdp->qlen == 0 && rdp->qlen_last_fqs_check != 0) {
[...]
+	} else if (rdp->qlen < rdp->qlen_last_fqs_check - qhimark)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'compatability' may be misspelled - perhaps 'compatibility'?
#345: FILE: kernel/rcutree_plugin.h:403:
+ * grace period, but this is the crude slow compatability hack, so just
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'preemptable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'preemptible'?
#383: FILE: kernel/rcutree_plugin.h:589:
+ * But because preemptable RCU does not exist, map to rcu-sched.
                ^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched_expedited', prefer 'synchronize_rcu_expedited' instead
#387: FILE: kernel/rcutree_plugin.h:593:
+	synchronize_sched_expedited();

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.
