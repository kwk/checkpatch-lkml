Currently there's a race on VT open/close path that can trigger messages like:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'occours' may be misspelled - perhaps 'occurs'?
#111: 
a hangup occours (like when you're trying to log in), the close() method will be
         ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "vc->vc_tty"
#153: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2740:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#246: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2816:
+	BUG_ON(vc == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
