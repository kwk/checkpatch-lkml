CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#84: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:763:
+extern int tcp_limit_reno_sacked(struct tcp_sock *tp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'adjustement' may be misspelled - perhaps 'adjustment'?
#101: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:1629:
+ * packets_out. Returns zero if sacked_out adjustement wasn't necessary.
                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#127: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:1652:
+	struct tcp_sock *tp = tcp_sk(sk);
+	if (tcp_limit_reno_sacked(tp))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
