Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#343: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2827:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "  %s zone: %lu pages, LIFO batch:%u\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#344: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2828:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "  %s zone: %lu pages, LIFO batch:%u\n",
+			zone->name, zone->present_pages,

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#364: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:3386:
+		printk("+++ Free area init core for zone %p\n", zone);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#382: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:4394:
+			setup_pagelist_highmark(CPU_PTR(zone->pageset, cpu),
+									high);

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#396: FILE: mm/vmstat.c:147:
+			CPU_PTR(zone->pageset, cpu)->stat_threshold
+							= threshold;

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#454: FILE: mm/cpu_alloc.c:192:
+	extern void allocate_pagesets(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
