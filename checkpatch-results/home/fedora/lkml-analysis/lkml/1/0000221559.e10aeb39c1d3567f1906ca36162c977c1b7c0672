WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#124: FILE: fs/buffer.c:269:
+			struct page *page = pvec.pages[i];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#128: FILE: fs/buffer.c:273:
+			bh = head = page_buffers(page);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
