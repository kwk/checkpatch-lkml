Subject: [PATCH 27/48] [GFS2] Add a function to interate over an extent

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns
#87: FILE: fs/gfs2/bmap.c:440:
+static inline unsigned int gfs2_extent_length(void *start, unsigned int len, __be64 *ptr, unsigned limit, int *eob)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
