#35: 
  USB debug port only supports 8 byte rx/tx packets. Although spec implies that "if a packet larger than eight bytes is received from the remote computer, the device must break the larger packet into eight-byte packets before sending the data to the Debug Port", the real PLX NET20DC device does not handle it right - data is corrupted on debug port end if serial interface sends >8 byte urbs. Patch below fixes the issue by limiting tx urb to 8 byte.

This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
