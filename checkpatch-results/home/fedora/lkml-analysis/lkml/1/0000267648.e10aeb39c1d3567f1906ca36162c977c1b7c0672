#27: 
(on top of [PATCH] workqueues: insert_work: use "list_head *" instead of "int tail"

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:201:
+extern int flush_work(struct work_struct *work);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
