CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#134: FILE: lib/proportions.c:252:
+	if (period < BITS_PER_LONG) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#136: FILE: lib/proportions.c:254:
+		s64 val = (u64)prop_local_read_percpu(pl);
+		__percpu_counter_add(&pl->events, -val + (val >> period), PROP_BATCH);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
