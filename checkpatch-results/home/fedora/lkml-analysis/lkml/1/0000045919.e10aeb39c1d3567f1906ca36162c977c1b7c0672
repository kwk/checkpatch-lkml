CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pic_irqchip"
#47: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/irq.h:91:
+	ret = (pic_irqchip(kvm) != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#73: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:2374:
+		if (vpic) {
[...]
+				kfree(vpic);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
