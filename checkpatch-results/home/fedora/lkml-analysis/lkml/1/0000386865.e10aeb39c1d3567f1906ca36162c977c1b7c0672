WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#35: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .17
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#76: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c:421:
+		cmd.val = (u32) perf->states[next_perf_state].control;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#167: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/user_syms.c:74:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_PROTO(futimes);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#224: FILE: drivers/base/cpu.c:58:
 static void __devinit register_cpu_control(struct cpu *cpu)

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#246: FILE: drivers/char/drm/i915_dma.c:510:
+				OUT_RING(MI_BATCH_BUFFER_START | (2 << 6) | MI_BATCH_NON_SECURE_I965);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#273: FILE: drivers/char/drm/i915_drv.h:283:
+#define MI_BATCH_NON_SECURE_I965 (1<<8)
                                    ^

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#273: FILE: drivers/char/drm/i915_drv.h:283:
+#define MI_BATCH_NON_SECURE_I965 (1<<8)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

#342: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c:112:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ctrl_classes"
#596: FILE: drivers/media/video/v4l2-common.c:1513:
+		if (*ctrl_classes == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#600: FILE: drivers/media/video/v4l2-common.c:1517:
+		while (*pctrl && *pctrl != id) pctrl++;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
