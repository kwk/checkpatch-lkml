#43: 
   Signed-off-by: Satoshi UCHIDA <uchida@ap.jp.nec.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#459: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:2049:
+	CFQ_DRV_UNIQ_DATA(cfqd).idle_slice_timer.data = (unsigned long) cfqd;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#504: FILE: include/linux/cfq-iosched.h:22:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#529: FILE: include/linux/cfq-iosched.h:39:
+^Iunsigned long last_end_request;^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#575: FILE: include/linux/cfq-iosched.h:81:
+static inline struct request_queue * __cfq_container_of_queue(struct work_struct *work) {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#575: FILE: include/linux/cfq-iosched.h:81:
+static inline struct request_queue * __cfq_container_of_queue(struct work_struct *work) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
