CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:294:
+extern void timekeeping_notify(struct clocksource *clock);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#169: FILE: kernel/time/clocksource.c:407:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "Switching to clocksource %s\n", best->name);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#340: FILE: kernel/time/timekeeping.c:360:
+	new = (struct clocksource *) data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
