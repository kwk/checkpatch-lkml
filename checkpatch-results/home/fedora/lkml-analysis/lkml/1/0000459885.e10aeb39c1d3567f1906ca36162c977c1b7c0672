__set_page_dirty().  The imlementation is slightly different, so that
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#325: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:630:
+	printk("fuse_page_dirtied: should not happen\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'fuse_page_dirtied', this function's name, in a string
#325: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:630:
+	printk("fuse_page_dirtied: should not happen\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#426: FILE: fs/libfs.c:634:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(simple_page_dirtied);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#610: FILE: include/linux/buffer_head.h:311:
+extern void block_set_page_dirty(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#665: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs.h:424:
+extern void nfs_set_page_dirty(struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#782: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:783:
+		struct address_space *mapping = page_mapping(page);
+		if (mapping)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
