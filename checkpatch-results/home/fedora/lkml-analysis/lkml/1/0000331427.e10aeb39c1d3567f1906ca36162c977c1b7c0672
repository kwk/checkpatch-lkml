WARNING:LIKELY_MISUSE: nested (un)?likely() calls, IS_ERR already uses unlikely() internally
#70: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:45:
+	if (unlikely(IS_ERR(name))) {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#107: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:82:
+		struct inode *inode = lower_dir_dentry->d_inode;
+		err = inode->i_op->unlink(inode, wh_dentry);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#110: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:85:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#111: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:86:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "unionfs: could not "
+		       "unlink whiteout, err = %d\n", err);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#162: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:137:
+		istart = iend = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
