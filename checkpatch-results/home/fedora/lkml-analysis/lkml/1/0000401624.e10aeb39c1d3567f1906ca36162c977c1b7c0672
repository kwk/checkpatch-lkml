#32: 
In struct device, we already have numa_node member. and we can use dev_to_node()

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'corresonding' may be misspelled - perhaps 'corresponding'?
#56: 
kmalloc/dma_map_single to use ram on corresonding node too.  esp for nvidia
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
