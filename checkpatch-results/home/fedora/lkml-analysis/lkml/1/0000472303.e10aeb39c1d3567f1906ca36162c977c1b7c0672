Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#58: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c:64:
+static int nomonotonic __initdata = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
