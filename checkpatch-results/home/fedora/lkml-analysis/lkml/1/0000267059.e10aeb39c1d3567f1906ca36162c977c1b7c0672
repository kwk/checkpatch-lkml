WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after ebda_start
#66: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/head.c:9:
+static unsigned int __initdata ebda_start;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#103: FILE: include/asm-x86/e820.h:87:
+extern int range_in_ebda_area(u64 start, u64 end);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
