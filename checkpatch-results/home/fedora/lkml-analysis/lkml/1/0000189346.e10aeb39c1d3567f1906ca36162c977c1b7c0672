Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'interface->altsetting[1].endpoint[0].desc.wMaxPacketSize == 940'
#102: FILE: drivers/media/video/em28xx/em28xx-video.c:2210:
+	if (usb_endpoint_xfer_isoc(endpoint)
+	     &&
 	    (interface->altsetting[1].endpoint[0].desc.wMaxPacketSize == 940))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
