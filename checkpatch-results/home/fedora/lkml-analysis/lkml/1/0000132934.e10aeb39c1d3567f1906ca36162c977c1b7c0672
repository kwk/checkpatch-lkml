ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#63: 
--- a/drivers/platform/x86/dell-wmi.c~	2009-04-28 17:12:01.000000000 -050=

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#68: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/dell-wmi.c:39:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#72: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/dell-wmi.c:42:
+/* Temporary workaround until the WMI sysfs interface goes in.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
