CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p == NULL'
#52: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process.c:467:
+	if ((p == NULL) || (p == current) || (p->state == TASK_RUNNING))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p == current'
#52: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process.c:467:
+	if ((p == NULL) || (p == current) || (p->state == TASK_RUNNING))

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p->state == TASK_RUNNING'
#52: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process.c:467:
+	if ((p == NULL) || (p == current) || (p->state == TASK_RUNNING))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p"
#52: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process.c:467:
+	if ((p == NULL) || (p == current) || (p->state == TASK_RUNNING))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#55: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process.c:470:
+	stack_page = (unsigned long) task_stack_page(p);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#69: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process.c:484:
+		ip = *((unsigned long *) sp);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#93: FILE: include/asm-um/processor-generic.h:131:
+extern unsigned long get_wchan(struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
