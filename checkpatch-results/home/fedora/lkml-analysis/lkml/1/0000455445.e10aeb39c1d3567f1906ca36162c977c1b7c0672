WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#32: 
- Scan all pages in the range, instead of bailing out on first uncached page.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rescue_pages', this function's name, in a string
#71: FILE: mm/readahead.c:744:
+	dprintk("rescue_pages(ino=%lu, index=%lu, nr=%lu)\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#72: FILE: mm/readahead.c:745:
+	dprintk("rescue_pages(ino=%lu, index=%lu, nr=%lu)\n",
 			mapping->host->i_ino, index, nr_pages);

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#75: FILE: mm/readahead.c:747:
+	for(; nr_pages;) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#76: FILE: mm/readahead.c:748:
+		grabbed_page = page = find_get_page(mapping, index);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
