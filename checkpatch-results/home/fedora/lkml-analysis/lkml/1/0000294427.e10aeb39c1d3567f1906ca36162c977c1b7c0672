CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#188: FILE: arch/s390/mm/pgtable.c:279:
+	tsk->mm = tsk->active_mm = mm;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#238: FILE: include/asm-s390/pgtable.h:969:
+extern int s390_enable_sie(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#251: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1769:
