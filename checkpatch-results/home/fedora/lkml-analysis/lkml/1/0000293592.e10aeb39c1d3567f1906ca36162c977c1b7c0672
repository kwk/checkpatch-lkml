CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: include/linux/writeback.h:108:
+extern unsigned long determine_dirtyable_memory(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#98: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2488:
+			(val + (ENTRIES_PER_PAGE-1)) / ENTRIES_PER_PAGE;
 			                        ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'useable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'usable'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
