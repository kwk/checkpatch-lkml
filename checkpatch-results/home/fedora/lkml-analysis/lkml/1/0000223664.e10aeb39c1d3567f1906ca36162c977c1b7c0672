ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#100: FILE: arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.c:294:
+		for (i = 0; i < n; i++) d[i] = s[i];

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#127: FILE: arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.c:378:
+	for (i = 0, direction = 1; i >= 0; i += direction) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
