CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*au1550_mtd)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct mtd_info)...)
#50: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/au1550nd.c:453:
+	au1550_mtd = kzalloc(sizeof(struct mtd_info) + sizeof(struct nand_chip), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
