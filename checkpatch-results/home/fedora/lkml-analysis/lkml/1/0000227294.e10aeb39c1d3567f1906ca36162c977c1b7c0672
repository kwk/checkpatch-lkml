CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#183: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu_init.c:811:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#240: FILE: include/asm-x86/amd_iommu.h:29:
+extern irqreturn_t amd_iommu_int_handler(int irq, void *data);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
