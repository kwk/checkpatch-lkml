explicitely.
^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#111: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:10:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#152: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:423:
+        u8 *addr = oaddr;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#152: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:423:
+        u8 *addr = oaddr;$

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#155: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c:426:
+		struct page *p = virt_to_page(addr);
+		addr = vmap(&p, 1, VM_MAP, PAGE_KERNEL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#188: FILE: include/asm-i386/alternative.h:152:
+extern void text_poke(void *addr, u8 opcode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
