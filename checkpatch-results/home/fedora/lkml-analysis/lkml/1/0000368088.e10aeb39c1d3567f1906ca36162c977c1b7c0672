Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'stl_intr', this function's name, in a string
#67: FILE: drivers/char/stallion.c:1632:
+	pr_debug("stl_intr(brdp=%p,irq=%d)\n", brdp, brdp->irq);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
