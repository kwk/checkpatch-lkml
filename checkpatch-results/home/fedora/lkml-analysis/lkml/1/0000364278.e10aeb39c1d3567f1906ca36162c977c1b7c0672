WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#105: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:85:
+int vfs_ioctl(struct file *filp, unsigned int fd, unsigned int cmd,
                            ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#193: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:124:
+			if (filp->f_op && filp->f_op->fasync) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
