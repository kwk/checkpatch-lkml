CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape.h:289:
+extern int tape_generic_pm_suspend(struct ccw_device *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ccw_device *' should also have an identifier name
#57: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape.h:289:
+extern int tape_generic_pm_suspend(struct ccw_device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#137: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape_core.c:400:
+	if (!device) {
+		return -ENODEV;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'tape_generic_pm_suspend', this function's name, in a string
#141: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape_core.c:404:
+	DBF_LH(3, "(%08x): tape_generic_pm_suspend(%p)\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#142: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape_core.c:405:
+	DBF_LH(3, "(%08x): tape_generic_pm_suspend(%p)\n",
+		device->cdev_id, device);

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#146: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape_core.c:409:
+		pr_err("A cartridge is loaded in tape device %s, "
+		       "refusing to suspend\n", dev_name(&cdev->dev));

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#151: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape_core.c:414:
+	switch (device->tape_state) {
+		case TS_INIT:
+		case TS_NOT_OPER:
+		case TS_UNUSED:

+		default:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
