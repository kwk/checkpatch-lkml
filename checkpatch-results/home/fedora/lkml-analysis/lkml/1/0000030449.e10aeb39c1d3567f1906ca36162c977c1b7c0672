the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name

#163: FILE: security/prctl_network.c:68:
+static inline int prctl_network_ptrace_access_check_hook(struct task_struct *child, unsigned int mode)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
