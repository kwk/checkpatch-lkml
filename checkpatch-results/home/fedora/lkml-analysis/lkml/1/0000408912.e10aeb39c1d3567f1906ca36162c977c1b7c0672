Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#756: FILE: fs/gfs2/ops_file.c:505:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#984: FILE: include/linux/gfs2_ondisk.h:507:
+extern void gfs2_inum_out(const struct gfs2_inode *ip, struct gfs2_dirent *dent);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
