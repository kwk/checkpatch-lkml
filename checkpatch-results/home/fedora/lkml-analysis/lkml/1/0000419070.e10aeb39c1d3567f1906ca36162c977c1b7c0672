WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct tty_operations should normally be const
#383: FILE: drivers/net/netconsole.c:511:
+static struct tty_operations netconsole_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
