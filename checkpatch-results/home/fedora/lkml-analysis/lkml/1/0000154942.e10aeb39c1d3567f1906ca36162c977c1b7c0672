CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#75: FILE: sound/usb/usbaudio.c:2535:
+		fp->rate_min = fp->rate_max = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
