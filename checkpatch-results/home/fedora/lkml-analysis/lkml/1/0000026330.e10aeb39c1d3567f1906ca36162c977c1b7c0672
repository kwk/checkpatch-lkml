This patch adds a NULL test to check wether kmalloc was successful or
                                     ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!odev->buf"
#56: FILE: drivers/staging/asus_oled/asus_oled.c:433:
+		if (odev->buf == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#58: FILE: drivers/staging/asus_oled/asus_oled.c:435:
+			printk(ASUS_OLED_ERROR "Out of memory!\n");
