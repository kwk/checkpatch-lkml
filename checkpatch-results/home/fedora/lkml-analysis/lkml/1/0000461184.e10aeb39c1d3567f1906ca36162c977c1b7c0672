WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#36: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .7
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#48: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvbdev.c:203:
+	struct file_operations *dvbdevfops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dvbdevfops)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct file_operations)...)
#57: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvbdev.c:224:
+	dvbdevfops = kzalloc(sizeof(struct file_operations), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#57: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvbdev.c:224:
+	dvbdevfops = kzalloc(sizeof(struct file_operations), GFP_KERNEL);

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#60: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvbdev.c:227:
+		kfree (dvbdev);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#72: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvbdev.c:239:
+	memcpy(dvbdev->fops, template->fops, sizeof(struct file_operations));

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#80: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvbdev.c:267:
+	kfree (dvbdev->fops);

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <idProduct>
#94: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/cxusb.c:474:
+		fw->data[BLUEBIRD_01_ID_OFFSET + 2] = le16_to_cpu(udev->descriptor.idProduct) + 1;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
