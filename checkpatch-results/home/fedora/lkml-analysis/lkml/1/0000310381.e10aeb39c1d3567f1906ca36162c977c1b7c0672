WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#83: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:223:
+		/* Fall through */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#85: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:225:
+		if (static_nodes)
[...]
+		else if (relative_nodes)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#90: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:230:
+		else {

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#118: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:258:
+			pol->v.preferred_node = node_remap(pol->v.preferred_node,
+					pol->w.cpuset_mems_allowed, *newmask);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#123: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:263:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
