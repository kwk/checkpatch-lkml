ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#33: 
--- a/drivers/char/synclink_gt.c	2009-04-16 09:50:46.000000000 -0500

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'isr_rxdata', this function's name, in a string
#72: FILE: drivers/char/synclink_gt.c:2122:
+		DBGISR(("isr_rxdata %s RDR=%04X\n", info->device_name, reg));

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#87: FILE: drivers/char/synclink_gt.c:2137:
+			info->rbuf_fill_count = count = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
