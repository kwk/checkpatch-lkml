WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#97: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:57:
+		/* We cannot allocate a mem_32 resource
+		   from a mem_64 area */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
