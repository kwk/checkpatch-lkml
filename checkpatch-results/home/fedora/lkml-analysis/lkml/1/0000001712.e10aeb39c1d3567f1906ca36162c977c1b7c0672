#26: 
enhanced cpu_stat with more detail, has guest_system and guest_user cpu time

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#93: FILE: fs/proc/stat.c:39:
+	guest = guest_nice = guest_user = guest_system = cputime64_zero;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#102: FILE: fs/proc/stat.c:57:
+		guest_user = cputime64_add(guest_user,
+			kstat_cpu(i).cpustat.guest_user);
