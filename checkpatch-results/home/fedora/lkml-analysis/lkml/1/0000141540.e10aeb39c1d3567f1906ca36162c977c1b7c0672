WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#77: 
rename from Documentation/ftrace.txt

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#191: FILE: include/trace/syscall.h:1:
+#ifndef _TRACE_SYSCALL_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#212: FILE: include/trace/syscall.h:22:
+extern void arch_init_ftrace_syscalls(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buf"
#240: FILE: kernel/trace/blktrace.c:1383:
+	if (buf == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
