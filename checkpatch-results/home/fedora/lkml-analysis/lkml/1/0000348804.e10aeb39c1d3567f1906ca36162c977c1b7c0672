#34: 
I noticed this vmlinux layout on i686 (where CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT = 7) :

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#48: 
# size vmlinux vmlinux.before_patch

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'vmlinux'
