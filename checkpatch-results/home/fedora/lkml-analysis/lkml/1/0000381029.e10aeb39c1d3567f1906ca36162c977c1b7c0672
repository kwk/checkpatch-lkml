CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#84: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1533:
+extern void release_uids(struct user_namespace *ns);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#110: FILE: kernel/user.c:207:
