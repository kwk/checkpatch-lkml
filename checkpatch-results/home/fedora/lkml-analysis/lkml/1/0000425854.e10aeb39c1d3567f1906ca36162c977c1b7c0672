CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#72: FILE: net/core/dst.c:135:
+       dst->input = dst->output = dst_discard;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
