CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#199: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:476:
+static void entity_served(struct io_entity *entity, unsigned long real_served,
+		unsigned long virtual_served, unsigned long nr_sectors)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#221: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:930:
 {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#336: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:3293:
+ ^Iint slice_expired = 0;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#336: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:3293:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#336: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:3293:

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#415: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:3530:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#458: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:3624:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'as_antic_timeout', this function's name, in a string
#618: FILE: block/as-iosched.c:750:
+	as_log(ad, "as_antic_timeout. antic_status=%d", ad->antic_status);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#645: FILE: block/as-iosched.c:1204:
+		} else

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#667: FILE: block/elevator-fq.h:268:
+					   * time slice length */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
