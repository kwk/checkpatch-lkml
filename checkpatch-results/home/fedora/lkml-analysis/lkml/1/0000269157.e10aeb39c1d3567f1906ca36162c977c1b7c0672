On PREEMPT_RT the allocators use preemptible locks, cpu bootstrap must have IRQs

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ist' may be misspelled - perhaps 'is'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#117: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup64.c:240:
+		orig_ist->ist[v] = t->ist[v] = (unsigned long)t->estacks[v];

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'existance' may be misspelled - perhaps 'existence'?
