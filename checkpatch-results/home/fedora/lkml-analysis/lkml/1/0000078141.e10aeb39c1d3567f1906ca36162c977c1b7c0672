WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#142: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#147: FILE: drivers/regulator/ab3100.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#148: FILE: drivers/regulator/ab3100.c:2:
+ * drivers/regulator/ab3100.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#254: FILE: drivers/regulator/ab3100.c:108:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#356: FILE: drivers/regulator/ab3100.c:210:
+		udelay(200);

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/timers/timers-howto.html#delays-information-on-the-various-kernel-delay-sleep-mechanisms

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#395: FILE: drivers/regulator/ab3100.c:249:
+			(void) ab3100_set_register_interruptible(abreg->ab3100,

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#404: FILE: drivers/regulator/ab3100.c:258:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct regulator_ops should normally be const

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
