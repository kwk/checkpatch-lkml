#37: 
The additional locking added to the futex_wait function has no visible speed

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1680:
+extern void futex_adjust_waiters(struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#87: FILE: kernel/futex.c:332:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#107: FILE: kernel/futex.c:352:
+				int prio = min(p->normal_prio, MAX_RT_PRIO);
+				plist_del(&q->list, &hb->chain);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
