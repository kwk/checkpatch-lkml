Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#1030: FILE: drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c:954:
+	if (pr->flags.power == 0) {
+		return -EINVAL;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cx->type != ACPI_STATE_C1'

+		if ((cx->type != ACPI_STATE_C1) && (num_online_cpus() > 1) &&
+		    !pr->flags.has_cst && !acpi_fadt.plvl2_up)

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
