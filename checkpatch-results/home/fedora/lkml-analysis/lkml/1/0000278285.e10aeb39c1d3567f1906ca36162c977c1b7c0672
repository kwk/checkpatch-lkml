Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pgdat"
#65: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:969:
+	while (pgdat != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#111: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1015:
+struct seq_operations memcg_numastat_op = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
