WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .37
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/elf.h> instead of <asm/elf.h>
#251: FILE: arch/x86/mm/mmap.c:32:
+#include <asm/elf.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#256: FILE: arch/x86/mm/mmap.c:37:
+	unsigned int max = 0;
+	if ((current->flags & PF_RANDOMIZE) &&

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#257: FILE: arch/x86/mm/mmap.c:38:
+	if ((current->flags & PF_RANDOMIZE) &&
+		!(current->personality & ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE)) {

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#272: FILE: arch/x86/mm/mmap.c:51:
+#define MIN_GAP (128*1024*1024UL + stack_maxrandom_size())
                     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

                          ^

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#405: FILE: kernel/time/timekeeping.c:494:
+ ^I * xtime_nsec is not as small.$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#405: FILE: kernel/time/timekeeping.c:494:
+ ^I * xtime_nsec is not as small.$

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#409: FILE: kernel/time/timekeeping.c:498:

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

NOTE: Whitespace errors detected.
