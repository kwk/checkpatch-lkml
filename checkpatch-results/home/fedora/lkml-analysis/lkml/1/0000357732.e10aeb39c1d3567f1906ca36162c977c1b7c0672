#34: 
However NFS's ->mmap hook, which is called under mmap_sem, can take i_mutex.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#54: FILE: fs/nfs/file.c:45:
+nfs_file_mmap_prepare(struct file * file, unsigned long len,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
