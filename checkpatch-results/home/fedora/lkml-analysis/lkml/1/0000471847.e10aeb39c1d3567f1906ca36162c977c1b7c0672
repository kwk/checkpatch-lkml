      pata_atiixp: propogate cable detection hack from drivers/ide to the new driver
                   ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#85: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_atiixp.c:49:
+	/* Hack from drivers/ide/pci. Really we want to know how to do the
+	   raw detection not play follow the bios mode guess */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
