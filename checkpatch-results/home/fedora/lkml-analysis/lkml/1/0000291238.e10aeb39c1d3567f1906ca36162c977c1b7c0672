CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#85: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:75:
+extern int freeze_task(struct task_struct *p, int with_mm_only);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#147: FILE: kernel/freezer.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#148: FILE: kernel/freezer.c:2:
+ * kernel/freezer.c - Function to freeze a process

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#175: FILE: kernel/freezer.c:29:
+	/* Hmm, should we be allowed to suspend when there are realtime
+	   processes around? */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'refrigerator', this function's name, in a string
#187: FILE: kernel/freezer.c:41:
+	pr_debug("%s entered refrigerator\n", current->comm);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
