WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#75: FILE: kernel/rcupdate.c:83:
+	struct rcu_synchronize rcu;
+	init_completion(&rcu.completion);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'call_rcu_sched', prefer 'call_rcu' instead
#99: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:1185:
+	call_rcu_sched(&rcu.head, wakeme_after_rcu);

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.
