WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dma_irq_handler', this function's name, in a string
#54: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_bfin5xx.c:587:
+		"in dma_irq_handler dmastat:0x%x spistat:0x%x\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#63: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_bfin5xx.c:595:
+			break;
+		} else

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#63: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_bfin5xx.c:595:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
