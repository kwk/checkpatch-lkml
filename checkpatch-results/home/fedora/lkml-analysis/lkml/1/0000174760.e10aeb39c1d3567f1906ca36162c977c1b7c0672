WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#47: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#279: FILE: arch/x86/mach-generic/numaq.c:17:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#291: FILE: arch/x86/mach-generic/numaq.c:29:
+void default_send_IPI_mask_allbutself(const struct cpumask *mask, int vector);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#325: FILE: arch/x86/mach-generic/numaq.c:63:
+	printk("Storing NMI vector\n");

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#327: FILE: arch/x86/mach-generic/numaq.c:65:
+	  *((volatile unsigned short *)phys_to_virt(NUMAQ_TRAMPOLINE_PHYS_HIGH));

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#329: FILE: arch/x86/mach-generic/numaq.c:67:
+	  *((volatile unsigned short *)phys_to_virt(NUMAQ_TRAMPOLINE_PHYS_LOW));

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'apicid' may be better as '(apicid)' to avoid precedence issues
#348: FILE: arch/x86/mach-generic/numaq.c:86:
+#define apicid_cluster(apicid) (apicid & 0xF0)

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#362: FILE: arch/x86/mach-generic/numaq.c:100:
+	printk("Enabling APIC mode:  %s.  Using %d I/O APICs\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#363: FILE: arch/x86/mach-generic/numaq.c:101:
+	printk("Enabling APIC mode:  %s.  Using %d I/O APICs\n",
+		"NUMA-Q", nr_ioapics);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#404: FILE: arch/x86/mach-generic/numaq.c:142:
+static inline int numaq_apicid_to_node(int logical_apicid) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#414: FILE: arch/x86/mach-generic/numaq.c:152:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
