CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:287:
+extern void __init early_kgdboc_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "kdb_poll_funcs[i]"
#159: FILE: kernel/kgdb.c:293:
+		for (i = 0; kdb_poll_funcs[i] != NULL; i++) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#193: FILE: kernel/kgdb.c:431:
+	int ret = kgdb_io_ops->read_char();
+	while (ret == NO_POLL_CHAR)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (16, 37)
#205: FILE: kernel/kgdb.c:465:
+		while ((ch = (kgdb_read_wait())) != '$')
 			/* nothing */;
