WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#63: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#68: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'bat' - possible side-effects?
#87: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:20:
+#define BATTERY_PROP(bat, prop) ({                                 \
+	void *value = bat->get_property(bat, BATTERY_PROP_##prop); \
+	value ? *(int*)value : 0;                                  \
+})

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'bat' may be better as '(bat)' to avoid precedence issues
#87: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:20:
+#define BATTERY_PROP(bat, prop) ({                                 \
+	void *value = bat->get_property(bat, BATTERY_PROP_##prop); \
+	value ? *(int*)value : 0;                                  \
+})

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#89: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:22:
+	value ? *(int*)value : 0;                                  \

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#93: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:26:
+                                            BATTERY_PROP_##prop)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#93: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:26:
+                                            BATTERY_PROP_##prop)$

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#108: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:41:
+		/* If none of battery devices cantains 'main_battery' flag,
+		   choice one with maximum design charge */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
#121: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:54:

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'status == BATTERY_STATUS_CHARGING'
#224: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:157:
+	if ((status == BATTERY_STATUS_CHARGING) ||
+	    (status == BATTERY_STATUS_NOT_CHARGING) ||
+	    (status == BATTERY_STATUS_FULL))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'status == BATTERY_STATUS_NOT_CHARGING'
#224: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:157:
+	if ((status == BATTERY_STATUS_CHARGING) ||
+	    (status == BATTERY_STATUS_NOT_CHARGING) ||
+	    (status == BATTERY_STATUS_FULL))

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'status == BATTERY_STATUS_FULL'
#224: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:157:
+	if ((status == BATTERY_STATUS_CHARGING) ||
+	    (status == BATTERY_STATUS_NOT_CHARGING) ||
+	    (status == BATTERY_STATUS_FULL))

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#241: FILE: drivers/battery/apm_power.c:174:
+	if (status == BATTERY_STATUS_CHARGING)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
