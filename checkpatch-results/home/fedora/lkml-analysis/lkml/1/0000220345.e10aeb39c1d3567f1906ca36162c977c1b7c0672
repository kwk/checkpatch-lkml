CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#111: FILE: drivers/spi/pxa2xx_spi.c:852:
+	if (transfer->len > MAX_DMA_LEN && chip->enable_dma) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#114: FILE: drivers/spi/pxa2xx_spi.c:855:
+		if (message->is_dma_mapped
+				|| transfer->rx_dma || transfer->tx_dma) {

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pump_transfers', this function's name, in a string
#116: FILE: drivers/spi/pxa2xx_spi.c:857:
+				"pump_transfers: mapped transfer length "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#117: FILE: drivers/spi/pxa2xx_spi.c:858:
+				"pump_transfers: mapped transfer length "
+				"of %lu is greater than %d\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
