#37: 
Brian Wang reported that a FUSE filesystem exported through NFS could return

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#327: FILE: fs/splice.c:232:
+	BUG_ON(spd->nr_pages >= PIPE_BUFFERS);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#417: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1876:
+extern void do_generic_file_read(struct file *filp, loff_t *ppos,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
