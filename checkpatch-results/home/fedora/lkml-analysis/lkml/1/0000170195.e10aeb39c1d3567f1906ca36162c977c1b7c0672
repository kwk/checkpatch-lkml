CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.h:504:
+extern int trace_selftest_startup_function_graph(struct tracer *trace,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#84: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_selftest.c:232:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
