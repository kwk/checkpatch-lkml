ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#145: FILE: fs/gfs2/glock.c:798:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#145: FILE: fs/gfs2/glock.c:798:

#230: FILE: fs/gfs2/glops.c:286:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
