WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#95: FILE: drivers/net/forcedeth.c:2567:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "%s: Got tx_timeout. irq: %08x tx_stop=%d\n", dev->name, status, np->tx_stop);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
