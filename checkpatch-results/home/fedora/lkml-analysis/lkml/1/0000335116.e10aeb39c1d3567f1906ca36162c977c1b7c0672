WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'noone' may be misspelled - perhaps 'no one'?
#68: FILE: include/linux/kthread.h:19:
+ * standalone thread for which noone will call kthread_stop(), or
                                ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'typeof(data)' should also have an identifier name
#76: FILE: include/linux/kthread.h:27:
+	int (*_threadfn)(typeof(data)) = (threadfn);		\

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
