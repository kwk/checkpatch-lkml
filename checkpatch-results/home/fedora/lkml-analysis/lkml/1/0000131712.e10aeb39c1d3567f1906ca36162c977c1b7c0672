2.6.28-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

WARNING:BAD_STABLE_ADDRESS_STYLE: Invalid email format for stable: 'stable <stable@kernel.org>', prefer 'stable@kernel.org'
#60: 
Cc: stable <stable@kernel.org>

The email format for stable is incorrect.
Some valid options for stable address are::

  1. stable@vger.kernel.org
  2. stable@kernel.org

For adding version info, the following comment style should be used::

  stable@vger.kernel.org # version info

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#93: FILE: drivers/usb/host/ehci-q.c:343:
 			if ((token & QTD_STS_HALT) != 0) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
