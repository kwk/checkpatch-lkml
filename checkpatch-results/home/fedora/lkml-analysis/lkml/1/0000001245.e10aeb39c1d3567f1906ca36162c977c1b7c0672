Subject: [PATCH 2/2] staging: hv: trivial whitespace fixes found by checkpatch.pl Signed-off-by: Lars Lindley <lindley@coyote.org>

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

#100: FILE: drivers/staging/hv/StorVsc.c:556:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
