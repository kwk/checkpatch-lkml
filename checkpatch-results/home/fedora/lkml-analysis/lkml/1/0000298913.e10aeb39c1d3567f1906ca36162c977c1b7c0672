WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#47: 
# acpi/cpufreq

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#284: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c:1247:
+		printk(KERN_ERR PFX

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'powernowk8_get', this function's name, in a string
#285: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c:1248:
+			"limiting to CPU %d failed in powernowk8_get\n", cpu);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
