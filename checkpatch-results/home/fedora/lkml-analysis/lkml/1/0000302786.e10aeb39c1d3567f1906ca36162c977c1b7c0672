WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#98: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#103: FILE: drivers/char/bfin-otp.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#124: FILE: drivers/char/bfin-otp.c:22:
+#include <asm/uaccess.h>

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#128: FILE: drivers/char/bfin-otp.c:26:
+#define pr_init(fmt, args...) ({ static const __initconst char __fmt[] = fmt; printk(__fmt, ## args); })

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#128: FILE: drivers/char/bfin-otp.c:26:
+#define pr_init(fmt, args...) ({ static const __initconst char __fmt[] = fmt; printk(__fmt, ## args); })

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#218: FILE: drivers/char/bfin-otp.c:116:
+static ssize_t bfin_otp_write(struct file *filp, const char __user *buff, size_t count, loff_t *pos)
                                            ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#238: FILE: drivers/char/bfin-otp.c:136:
+static struct file_operations bfin_otp_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
