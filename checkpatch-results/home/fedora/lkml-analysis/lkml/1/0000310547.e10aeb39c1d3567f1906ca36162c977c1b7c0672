Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#96: 
- Fix text_set and text_poke alignment check (mixed up bitwise and and or)

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/cacheflush.h> instead of <asm/cacheflush.h>
#127: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:14:
+#include <asm/cacheflush.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#128: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:15:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#288: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:485:
+	unsigned long flags;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#293: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:490:
+	/* Could also do a CLFLUSH here to speed up CPU recovery; but
+	   that causes hangs on some VIA CPUs. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#314: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:511:
+	BUG_ON(len > sizeof(long));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#343: FILE: include/asm-x86/alternative.h:159:
+extern void add_nops(void *insns, unsigned int len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
