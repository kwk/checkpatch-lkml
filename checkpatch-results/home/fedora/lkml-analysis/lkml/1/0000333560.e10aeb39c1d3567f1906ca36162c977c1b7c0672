CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#124: FILE: fs/afs/inode.c:305:
+	_enter("{ ino=%lu v=%llu }", inode->i_ino,
+		(unsigned long long)inode->i_version);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#176: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:127:
+#define MS_I_VERSION	(1<<23) /* Update inode I_version field */
                     	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#176: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:127:
+#define MS_I_VERSION	(1<<23) /* Update inode I_version field */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#201: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1399:
+extern void inode_inc_iversion(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
