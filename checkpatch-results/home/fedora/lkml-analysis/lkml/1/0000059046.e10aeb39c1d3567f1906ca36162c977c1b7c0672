CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:320:
+extern sector_t map_swap_page(swp_entry_t, struct block_device **);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'swp_entry_t' should also have an identifier name
#63: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:320:
+extern sector_t map_swap_page(swp_entry_t, struct block_device **);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct block_device **' should also have an identifier name
#63: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:320:
+extern sector_t map_swap_page(swp_entry_t, struct block_device **);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#91: FILE: mm/page_io.c:30:
+		swp_entry_t entry;
+		entry.val = page_private(page);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
