#21: 
This patch updates pipefs to do defer assigning an i_ino value to its inodes

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#61: FILE: fs/pipe.c:850:
+static struct inode_operations pipefs_inode_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#92: FILE: fs/pipe.c:911:
+	this.len = sprintf(name, "[%lu]",
+		   (unsigned long) inode ^ pipefs_dname_obfuscator);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#92: FILE: fs/pipe.c:911:
+		   (unsigned long) inode ^ pipefs_dname_obfuscator);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
