CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ubd_dev->cow.file"
#41: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:1221:
+	io_req->fds[0] = (ubd_dev->cow.file == NULL) ? -1 : ubd_dev->cow.fd;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
