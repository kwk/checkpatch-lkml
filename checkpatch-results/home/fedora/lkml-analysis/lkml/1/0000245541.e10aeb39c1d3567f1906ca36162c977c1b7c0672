Avoid probing the io-ports in case an IDE PCI controller is present and it uses

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0x00
#66: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-generic.c:30:
+static int probe_mask = 0x00;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#85: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-generic.c:116:

[...]

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
