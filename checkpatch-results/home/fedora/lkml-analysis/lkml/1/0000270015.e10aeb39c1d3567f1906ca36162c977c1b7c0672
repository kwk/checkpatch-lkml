Subject: lt2p: Fix possible WARN_ON from socket code when UDP socket is closed

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "session"
#89: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:1305:
+	if (session != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#91: FILE: drivers/net/pppol2tp.c:1307:
+		struct sk_buff *skb;
+		while ((skb = skb_dequeue(&session->reorder_q))) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
