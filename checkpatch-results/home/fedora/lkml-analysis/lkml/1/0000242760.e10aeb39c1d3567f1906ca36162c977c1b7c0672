CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment
#80: FILE: kernel/printk.c:990:
+	spinlock_t	lock;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#91: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1001:
+	BUG_ON(!klogd_wakeup_state.pending);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
