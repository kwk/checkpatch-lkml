Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*nb)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct notifier_block)...)
#105: FILE: lib/dma-debug.c:511:
+	nb = kzalloc(sizeof(struct notifier_block), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!nb"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
