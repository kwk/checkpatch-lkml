Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'verion' may be misspelled - perhaps 'version'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files

+extern char kvm_asm_mov_from_ar;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
