Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

DRM memory manager also required this to get useable speeds.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#118: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:129:
+	BUG_ON(irqs_disabled());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#138: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:149:
+			clflush_cache_range((void *) *addr, PAGE_SIZE);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#201: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:677:
+	if (within(vaddr, (unsigned long) _text, (unsigned long) _end))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#426: FILE: include/asm-x86/cacheflush.h:69:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
