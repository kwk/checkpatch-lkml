CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: include/linux/slow-work.h:102:
+extern int delayed_slow_work_enqueue(struct delayed_slow_work *dwork,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#70: FILE: include/linux/slow-work.h:103:
+extern int delayed_slow_work_enqueue(struct delayed_slow_work *dwork,
+					unsigned long delay);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#85: FILE: kernel/slow-work.c:323:
+	struct slow_work *work = (struct slow_work *) data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#112: FILE: kernel/slow-work.c:350:
+	BUG_ON(slow_work_user_count <= 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
