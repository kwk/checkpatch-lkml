WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#63: FILE: drivers/net/virtio_net.c:88:
+	for (end = page; end->private; end = (struct page *)end->private);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#73: FILE: drivers/net/virtio_net.c:97:
+	if (p) {
[...]
+		p->private = 0;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#78: FILE: drivers/net/virtio_net.c:101:
+	} else

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#87: FILE: drivers/net/virtio_net.c:128:
+static int skb_set_frag(struct sk_buff *skb, struct page *page,
+				int offset, int len)
