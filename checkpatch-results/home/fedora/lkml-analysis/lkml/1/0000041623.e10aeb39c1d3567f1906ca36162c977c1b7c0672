WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#28: 
o Async queues are not per group. Instead these are system wide and maintained

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#51: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:409:
+static inline int cfqg_busy_async_queues(struct cfq_data *cfqd,
+					struct cfq_group *cfqg)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#69: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:911:
+	BUG_ON(nr_sync < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#70: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:912:
+	used_sl = charge_sl = cfq_cfqq_slice_usage(cfqq);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#99: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:2045:
+		tmp = tmp/cfqd->busy_queues;
 		         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#100: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:2046:
+		slice = min_t(unsigned, slice, tmp);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#106: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:2051:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
