commit a972c49404c18ed15db2c1cce5f414293f73c8d9

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#102: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:393:
+	struct file * cons_filp = NULL;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#114: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:413:
+			cons_filp = filp;
 			            ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#134: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:484:
+	if (cons_filp) {
[...]
+	} else if (tty->driver.hangup)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
