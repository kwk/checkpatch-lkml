CHECK:ARCH_DEFINES: architecture specific defines should be avoided
#54: FILE: drivers/char/rtc.c:85:
+#if defined(__i386__) || defined(__x86_64__)

Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever
possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/apic.h:89:
+extern int apic_is_clustered_box(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
