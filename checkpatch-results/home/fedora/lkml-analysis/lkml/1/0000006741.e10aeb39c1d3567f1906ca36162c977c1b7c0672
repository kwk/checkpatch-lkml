WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'independant' may be misspelled - perhaps 'independent'?
#36: 
The CS5535 GPIO has independant controls for input and output enable.
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#37: 
Use the set_direction method instead of direction_input and direction_output

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
