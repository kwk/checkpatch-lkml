Thanks, this patch should apply on top of the previous patch in this thread.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#61: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/prom_parse.c:1012:
+	 * resource and the irq are valid. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#63: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/prom_parse.c:1014:
+		r->start = r->end = irq;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/prom.h:338:
+extern int of_irq_to_resource(struct device_node *dev, int index,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#91: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/prom.h:339:
+extern int of_irq_to_resource(struct device_node *dev, int index,
+			struct resource *r);
