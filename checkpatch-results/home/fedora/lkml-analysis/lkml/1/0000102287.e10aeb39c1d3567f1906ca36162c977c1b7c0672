WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#94: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_serial.c:66:
+static int __devinit netmos_parallel_init(struct pci_dev *dev, struct parport_pc_pci *par, int autoirq, int autodma)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
