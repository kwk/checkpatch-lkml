WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns
#127: FILE: fs/autofs4/root.c:499:
+static struct dentry *autofs4_lookup_unhashed(struct autofs_sb_info *sbi, struct dentry *parent, struct qstr *name)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
