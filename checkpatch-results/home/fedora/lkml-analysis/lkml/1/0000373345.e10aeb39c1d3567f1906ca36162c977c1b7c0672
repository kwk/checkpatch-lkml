#35: 
affs_iget() then uses iget_locked() directly and returns a proper error code

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: fs/affs/affs.h:177:
+extern struct inode		*affs_iget(struct super_block *sb, unsigned long ino);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'affs_iget', this function's name, in a string
#112: FILE: fs/affs/inode.c:36:
+	pr_debug("AFFS: affs_iget(%lu)\n",inode->i_ino);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
