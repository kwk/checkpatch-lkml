#66: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/head.S:1190:
+	.global ia64_spinlock_contention_end	// for determining if we are in ia64_spinlock_contention code.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'ent->ip >= (unsigned long)ia64_spinlock_contention'

+	if ((ent->ip >= (unsigned long)ia64_spinlock_contention) &&
+	    (ent->ip < (unsigned long)ia64_spinlock_contention_end))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
