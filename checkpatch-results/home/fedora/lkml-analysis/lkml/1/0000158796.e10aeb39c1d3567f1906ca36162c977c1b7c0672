WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#50: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c:192:
+	u32 uninitialized_var(ier);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ier' should also have an identifier name
#50: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c:192:
+	u32 uninitialized_var(ier);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#83: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.h:224:
+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_RESTORE_IRQS_AFTER_RESET		(1<<19)
                                             		  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#83: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.h:224:
+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_RESTORE_IRQS_AFTER_RESET		(1<<19)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
