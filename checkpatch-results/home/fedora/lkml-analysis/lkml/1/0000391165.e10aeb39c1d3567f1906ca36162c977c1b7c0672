#27: 
The last patch to clean out 'othercon' structures only fixed half the problem.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#30: 
Signed-Off-By: Patrick Caulfield <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#52: FILE: fs/dlm/lowcomms.c:338:
+	/* If we are an 'othercon' then NULL the pointer to us
+	   from the parent and tidy ourself up */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+	   from the parent and tidy ourself up */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#55: FILE: fs/dlm/lowcomms.c:341:
+		struct connection *parent = __nodeid2con(con->nodeid, 0);
+		parent->othercon = NULL;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'

+	else {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#58: FILE: fs/dlm/lowcomms.c:344:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
