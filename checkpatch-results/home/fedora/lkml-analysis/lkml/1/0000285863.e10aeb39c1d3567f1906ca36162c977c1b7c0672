        ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#66: FILE: include/asm-generic/bug.h:79:
+#define WARN_ON_RATELIMIT(condition, state)			\
+		WARN_ON((condition) && __ratelimit(state));

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#122: FILE: include/linux/ratelimit.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_RATELIMIT_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#135: FILE: include/linux/ratelimit.h:14:
+extern int __ratelimit(struct ratelimit_state *rs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#139: FILE: include/linux/ratelimit.h:18:
+	static struct ratelimit_state rs;
+	return __ratelimit(&rs);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
