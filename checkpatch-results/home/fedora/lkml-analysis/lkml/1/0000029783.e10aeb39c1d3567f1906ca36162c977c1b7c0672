WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'rorated' may be misspelled - perhaps 'rotated'?
#35: 
At that time, I made the debug patch to show recent_anon_{scanned/rorated}
                                                                  ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#104: FILE: mm/vmstat.c:766:
 		   "\n  start_pfn:         %lu"

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
