#31: 
e820_resource_resources could use insert_resource instead of request_resource

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#117: FILE: include/asm-x86/e820_64.h:24:
+extern void e820_reserve_resources(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
