CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#120: FILE: include/linux/serial_core.h:420:
+	circ->head = circ->tail = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "return"
#179: FILE: include/linux/serial_core.h:479:
+	return (port->info) != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
