#35: 
early_serial_setup is removed from serial.h, but foget to put in

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#324: FILE: include/linux/serial_8250.h:63:
+extern int early_serial_setup(struct uart_port *port);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
