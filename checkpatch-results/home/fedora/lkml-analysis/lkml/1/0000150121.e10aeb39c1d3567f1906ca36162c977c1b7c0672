WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#90: FILE: drivers/watchdog/riowd.c:133:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'new_margin < 60'
#104: FILE: drivers/watchdog/riowd.c:145:
+		if ((new_margin < 60) || (new_margin > (255 * 60))) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#115: FILE: drivers/watchdog/riowd.c:155:
+		long ret = put_user(riowd_timeout * 60, (int __user *)argp);
+		unlock_kernel();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
