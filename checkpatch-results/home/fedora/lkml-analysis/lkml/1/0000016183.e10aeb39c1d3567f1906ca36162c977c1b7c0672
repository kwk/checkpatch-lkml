WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:QUOTED_WHITESPACE_BEFORE_NEWLINE: unnecessary whitespace before a quoted newline
#298: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/leon_kernel.c:127:
+			prom_printf("irq timer not configured with separate irqs \n");

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#350: FILE: drivers/acpi/proc.c:438:
 				       "ACPI: '%s' and '%s' have the same GPE, "
+				       "can't disable/enable one separately\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#363: FILE: drivers/block/drbd/drbd_int.h:1174:
+   * or on a separate meta data device. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#456: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.h:218:
+	 * tuners which require sophisticated tuning loops, controlling each parameter separately. */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
