CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/device.h:594:
+extern void dynamic_printk(char *, char *, ...);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char *' should also have an identifier name
#67: FILE: include/linux/device.h:594:
+extern void dynamic_printk(char *, char *, ...);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#192: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:21:

The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

#199: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:28:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#211: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:40:
+	unsigned int hash = full_name_hash(name, strlen(name));
+	return (hash & ((1 << FILE_HASH_BITS) - 1));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*new)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct debug_name)...)
#241: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:70:
+	new = kmalloc(sizeof(struct debug_name), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!element"
#257: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:86:
+	if (element == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#272: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:101:
+	if (all)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.
