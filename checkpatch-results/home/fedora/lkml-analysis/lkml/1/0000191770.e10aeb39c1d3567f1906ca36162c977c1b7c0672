Subject: [PATCH 3/6] drm/i915: fix sparse warnings: move 'extern' decls to header file

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct intel_dvo_dev_ops should normally be const
#51: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/dvo.h:151:
+extern struct intel_dvo_dev_ops sil164_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
