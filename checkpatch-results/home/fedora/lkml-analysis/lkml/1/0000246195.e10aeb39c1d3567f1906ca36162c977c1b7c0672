CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#129: FILE: include/asm-x86/geode.h:241:
+extern int geode_mfgpt_set_irq(int timer, int cmp, int *irq, int enable);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
