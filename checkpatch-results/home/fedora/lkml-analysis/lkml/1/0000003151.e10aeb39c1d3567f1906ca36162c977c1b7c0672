WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'hdmi_setup_audio_infoframe', this function's name, in a string
#65: FILE: sound/pci/hda/patch_hdmi.c:602:
+			snd_printdd("hdmi_setup_audio_infoframe: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#66: FILE: sound/pci/hda/patch_hdmi.c:603:
+			snd_printdd("hdmi_setup_audio_infoframe: "
+				    "cvt=%d pin=%d channels=%d\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
