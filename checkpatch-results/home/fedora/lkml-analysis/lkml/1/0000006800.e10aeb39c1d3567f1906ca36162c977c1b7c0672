CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#134: FILE: security/keys/internal.h:118:
+extern int install_session_keyring_to_cred(struct cred *, struct key *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct cred *' should also have an identifier name
#134: FILE: security/keys/internal.h:118:
+extern int install_session_keyring_to_cred(struct cred *, struct key *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#158: FILE: security/keys/request_key.c:63:
+	struct cred *cred = (struct cred*)current_cred();

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#170: FILE: security/keys/request_key.c:75:
+	struct key *keyring = info->data;
+	key_put(keyring);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
