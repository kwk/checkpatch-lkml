WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'preperation' may be misspelled - perhaps 'preparation'?
#30: 
In preperation for blocking fsnotify calls group priorities must be added.
   ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 143 exceeds 100 columns
#120: FILE: include/linux/fsnotify_backend.h:72:
+extern struct fsnotify_group *fsnotify_find_group(unsigned int priority, unsigned int group_num, unsigned long mask, struct fsnotify_ops *ops);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#120: FILE: include/linux/fsnotify_backend.h:72:
+extern struct fsnotify_group *fsnotify_find_group(unsigned int priority, unsigned int group_num, unsigned long mask, struct fsnotify_ops *ops);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
