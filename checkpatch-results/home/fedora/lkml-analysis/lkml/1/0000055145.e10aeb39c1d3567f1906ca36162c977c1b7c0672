WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#139: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:376:
+	unsigned busy = cfq_busy_queues_wl(rt, cfqd);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#184: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:650:
+		if (time_before(rb_key, __cfqq->rb_key))
[...]
-		else if (cfq_class_rt(cfqq) < cfq_class_rt(__cfqq))
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#195: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:652:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#272: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:1408:
+	int i;
+	for (i = 0; i < 2; ++i)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
