WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#38: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .8
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#70: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/process_32.c:280:
+		switch(c->x86) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#109: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c:275:
+		switch(c->x86) {

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#162: FILE: arch/x86/lib/copy_user_64.S:248:
+.Ls1e: 	addl $8,%eax		/* eax is bytes left uncopied within the loop (Ls1e: 64 .. Ls8e: 8) */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#387: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c:1061:
+	 * calculation round soon. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
