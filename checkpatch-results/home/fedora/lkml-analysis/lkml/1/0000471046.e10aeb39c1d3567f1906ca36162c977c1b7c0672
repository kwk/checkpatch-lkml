Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 12)
#48: FILE: drivers/net/apne.c:250:
+	for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(program_seq); i++) {
 	    outb(program_seq[i].value, ioaddr + program_seq[i].offset);

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#48: FILE: drivers/net/apne.c:250:
+	for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(program_seq); i++) {
 	    outb(program_seq[i].value, ioaddr + program_seq[i].offset);
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#87: FILE: drivers/net/fec_8xx/fec_mii.c:313:
+	for (i = 0, phy = phy_info; i < ARRAY_SIZE(phy_info));
 	     i++, phy++)

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#87: FILE: drivers/net/fec_8xx/fec_mii.c:313:
+	for (i = 0, phy = phy_info; i < ARRAY_SIZE(phy_info));

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
