WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct super_block *' should also have an identifier name
#515: FILE: fs/nilfs2/nilfs.h:169:
+int nilfs_transaction_commit(struct super_block *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

+void nilfs_transaction_abort(struct super_block *);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#597: FILE: fs/nilfs2/segment.c:295:
+	BUG_ON(ti == NULL || ti->ti_magic != NILFS_TI_MAGIC);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ti"
#597: FILE: fs/nilfs2/segment.c:295:
+	BUG_ON(ti == NULL || ti->ti_magic != NILFS_TI_MAGIC);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
