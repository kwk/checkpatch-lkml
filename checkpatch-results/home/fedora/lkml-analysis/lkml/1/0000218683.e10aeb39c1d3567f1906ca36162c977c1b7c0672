CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#130: FILE: Documentation/lguest/lguest.c:1045:
+	nheads = len = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#350: FILE: include/linux/virtio_net.h:50:
+ * feature (or any later feature) has been negotiated. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#352: FILE: include/linux/virtio_net.h:52:
+struct virtio_net_hdr2
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
