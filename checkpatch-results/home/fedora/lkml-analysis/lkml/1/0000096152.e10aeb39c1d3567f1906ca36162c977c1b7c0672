CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <full_active_uAh>
#114: FILE: drivers/power/ds2760_battery.c:266:
+				int acr_val = di->full_active_uAh * 4L / 1000;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#115: FILE: drivers/power/ds2760_battery.c:267:
+				int acr_val = di->full_active_uAh * 4L / 1000;
+				ds2760_battery_set_current_accum(di, acr_val);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#124: FILE: drivers/power/ds2760_battery.c:432:
+	 * this should only be done for bootstrapping the value */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
