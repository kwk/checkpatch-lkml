Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
