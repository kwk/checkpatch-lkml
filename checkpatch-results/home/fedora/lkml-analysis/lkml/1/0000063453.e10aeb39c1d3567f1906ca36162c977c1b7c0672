CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#76: FILE: drivers/char/n_tty.c:1352:
+static int n_tty_receive_buf(struct tty_struct *tty, const unsigned char *cp,
 			      char *fp, int count)

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct tty_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#164: FILE: include/linux/tty_ldisc.h:136:
+	int	(*receive_buf)(struct tty_struct *, const unsigned char *cp,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
