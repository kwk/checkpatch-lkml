CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#138: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-3945.h:218:
+extern void iwl3945_rx_queue_reset(struct iwl_priv *priv, struct iwl_rx_queue *rxq);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#213: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-tx.c:802:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
