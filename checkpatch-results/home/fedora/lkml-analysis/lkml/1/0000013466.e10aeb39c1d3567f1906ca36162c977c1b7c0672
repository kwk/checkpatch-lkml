WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'refering' may be misspelled - perhaps 'referring'?
#30: 
Now, instead of refering to a static variable for ast/bast pointers, the
                ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#92: FILE: fs/ocfs2/stack_o2cb.c:280:
+	BUG_ON(conn->cc_proto == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!conn->cc_proto"
#92: FILE: fs/ocfs2/stack_o2cb.c:280:
+	BUG_ON(conn->cc_proto == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
