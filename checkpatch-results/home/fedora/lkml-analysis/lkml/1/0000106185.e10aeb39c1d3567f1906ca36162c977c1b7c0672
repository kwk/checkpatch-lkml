WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#73: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#78: FILE: drivers/sfi/sfi_acpi.c:1:
+/* sfi_acpi.c Simple Firmware Interface - ACPI extensions */

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

#142: FILE: drivers/sfi/sfi_acpi.c:65:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#144: FILE: drivers/sfi/sfi_acpi.c:67:
+	BUG_ON(!xsdt);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - int sfi_acpi_init() should probably be int sfi_acpi_init(void)
#157: FILE: drivers/sfi/sfi_acpi.c:80:

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#165: FILE: drivers/sfi/sfi_acpi.c:88:
+int sfi_acpi_table_parse(char *signature, char *oem_id, char* oem_table_id,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
