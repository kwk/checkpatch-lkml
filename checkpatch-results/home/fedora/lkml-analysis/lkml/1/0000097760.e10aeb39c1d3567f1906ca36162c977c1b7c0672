WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Duplicate signature
#51: 
Signed-off-by: Frederic Weisbecker <fweisbec@gmail.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#88: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2287:
+#define cond_resched_bkl()	cond_resched();

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
