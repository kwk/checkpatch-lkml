Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#55: FILE: fs/gfs2/dir.c:1268:
+	unsigned entries = 0, entries2 = 0;

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#87: FILE: fs/gfs2/dir.c:1323:
+^I^I^I^I        "entries2 (%u) != g.offset (%u)\n",$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#87: FILE: fs/gfs2/dir.c:1323:
+				fs_warn(sdp, "Number of entries corrupt in dir leaf %llu, "
+				        "entries2 (%u) != g.offset (%u)\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#89: FILE: fs/gfs2/dir.c:1325:
+^I^I^I^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#98: FILE: fs/gfs2/dir.c:1336:
+	BUG_ON(entries2 != entries);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
