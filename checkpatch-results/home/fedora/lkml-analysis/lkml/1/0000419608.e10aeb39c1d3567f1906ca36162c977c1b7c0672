CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#64: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1249:
+				if (test_bit(BIO_UPTODATE, &sbio->bi_flags)) {
[...]
+				} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#67: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1252:
+						struct page *p, *s;
+						p = pbio->bi_io_vec[j].bv_page;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#69: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1254:
+						if (memcmp(page_address(p),

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
