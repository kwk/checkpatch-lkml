Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

#186: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/numa.c:344:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
