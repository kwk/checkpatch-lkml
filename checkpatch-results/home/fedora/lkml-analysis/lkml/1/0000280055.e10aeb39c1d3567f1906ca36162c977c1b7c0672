+	Compatible option for older userspace. If you have system without udev
+	support of module loading through aliases and also old

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#146: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#151: FILE: drivers/hid/hid-dummy.c:1:
+#include <linux/module.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#198: FILE: include/linux/hid.h:801:
+	extern void hid_compat_##name(void);	\

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
