CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/moduleparam.h:142:
+extern void destroy_params(const struct kernel_param *params, unsigned num);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
