> kernel/params.c:700: error: 'module_uevent_ops' undeclared here (not in a function)

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#115: FILE: kernel/params.c:716:
+static struct sysfs_ops module_sysfs_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
