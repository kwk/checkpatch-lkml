WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#25: 
Subject: [PATCH 06/21] ide: checkpatch.pl fixes for ide-timing.h

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'v' - possible side-effects?
#71: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-timing.h:69:
+#define EZ(v, unit)		((v) ? ENOUGH(v, unit) : 0)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!s"
#136: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-timing.h:125:
+	if (s == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
