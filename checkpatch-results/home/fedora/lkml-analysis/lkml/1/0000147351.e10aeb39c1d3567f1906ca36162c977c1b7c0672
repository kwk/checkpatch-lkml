+	---help---
+	  DRBD is a block device which is designed to build high availability
+	  clusters.  This is done by mirroring a whole block device via (a
+	  dedicated) network.  You could see it as a network RAID 1.
+
+	  Each minor device has a state, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'.
+	  On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to
+	  run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to the
+	  local 'lower level block device' and via network to the node with the
+	  device in 'secondary' state.
+	  The secondary device simply writes the data to its lower level block
+	  device. Currently no read-balancing via the network is done.
+
+	  DRBD can also be used with "shared-disk semantics" (primary-primary),
+	  even though it is a "shared-nothing cluster".  You'd need to use a
+	  cluster file system on top of that for cache coherency.
+
+	  DRBD management is done through user-space tools.
+	  For automatic failover you need a cluster manager (e.g. heartbeat).
+	  See also: http://www.drbd.org/, http://www.linux-ha.org
+
+	  If unsure, say N.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
