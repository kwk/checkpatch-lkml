WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct regulator_ops should normally be const

+static struct regulator_ops wm831x_epe_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

+	if (pdata == NULL || pdata->epe[id] == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pdata->epe[id]"

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dcdc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct wm831x_dcdc)...)
#80: FILE: drivers/regulator/wm831x-dcdc.c:645:
+	dcdc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct wm831x_dcdc), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
