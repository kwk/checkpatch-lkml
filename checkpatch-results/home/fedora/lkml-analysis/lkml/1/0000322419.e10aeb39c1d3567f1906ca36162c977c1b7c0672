CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sock"
#52: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:704:
+	if (sock == NULL || sock->sk == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sock->sk"
#52: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:704:
+	if (sock == NULL || sock->sk == NULL)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#65: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:1287:
+	BUG_ON(sk == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
