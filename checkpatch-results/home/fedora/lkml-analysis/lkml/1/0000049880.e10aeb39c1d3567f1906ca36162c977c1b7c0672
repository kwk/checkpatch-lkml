#35: 
This one enables the mpc52xx_spi driver for usage of user defined gpio lines

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#79: FILE: drivers/spi/mpc52xx_spi.c:103:
+	if (ms->gpio_cs_count > 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.
