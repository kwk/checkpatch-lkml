#66: 
So, the code allocates a transaction, but in the case where 'truncate' is !=0 and xfs_itruncate_start(ip, XFS_ITRUNC_DEFINITE, 0); happens to return an error, we'll just return from the function without dealing with the memory allocated byxfs_trans_alloc() and assigned to 'tp', thus it'll be orphaned/leaked - not good.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'intimite' may be misspelled - perhaps 'intimate'?
#68: 
What I'm wondering is this; is it enough, at this point, to call xfs_trans_free(tp); (it would seem to me that would be OK, but I'm not intimite with this code) or do we need a full xfs_trans_cancel(tp, 0);  ???
