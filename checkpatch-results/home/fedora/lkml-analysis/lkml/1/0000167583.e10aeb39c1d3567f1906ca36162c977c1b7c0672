#52: FILE: arch/x86/mm/memtest.c:133:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "early_memtest: wipe out last pattern");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'early_memtest', this function's name, in a string
#52: FILE: arch/x86/mm/memtest.c:133:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "early_memtest: wipe out last pattern");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
