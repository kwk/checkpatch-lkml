Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: arch/arm/include/asm/highmem.h:22:
+extern void *kmap_high_put(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#155: FILE: mm/highmem.c:356:
+		atomic_t *counter = &pkmap_count[PKMAP_NR(vaddr)];
+		if (atomic_inc_not_zero(counter)) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#175: FILE: mm/highmem.c:374:
+	BUG_ON(!vaddr);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
