CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/crc-itu-t.h:25:
+extern u16 crc_itu_t_bitreversed(u16 crc, const u8 *buffer, size_t len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
