WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#67: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:811:
+extern struct vm_operations_struct revoked_vm_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
