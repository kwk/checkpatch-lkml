WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct uio_mem *' should also have an identifier name
#81: FILE: drivers/uio/uio.c:72:
+	ssize_t (*show)(struct uio_mem *, char *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#86: FILE: drivers/uio/uio.c:77:
+	__ATTR(addr, S_IRUGO, map_addr_show, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#115: FILE: drivers/uio/uio.c:108:
+static struct sysfs_ops uio_sysfs_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
