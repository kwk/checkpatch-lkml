+# (c) 2008, Steven Rostedt <srostedt@redhat.com>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#471: FILE: include/linux/ftrace.h:145:
+extern void ftrace_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#472: FILE: include/linux/ftrace.h:146:
+extern void ftrace_init_module(unsigned long *start, unsigned long *end);

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#598: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:1550:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#622: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:1574:
+	last_ftrace_enabled = ftrace_enabled = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#637: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:1589:
+	while (!kthread_should_stop()) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#654: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:1606:
+				pr_info("hm, dftrace overflow: %lu change%s"
+					" (%lu total) in %lu usec%s\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#730: FILE: kernel/module.c:2178:
+		void *mseg = (void *)sechdrs[mcountindex].sh_addr;
+		ftrace_init_module(mseg, mseg + sechdrs[mcountindex].sh_size);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
