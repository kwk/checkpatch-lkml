#53: 
(page isn't uptodate).
            ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#258: FILE: fs/splice.c:168:
+	BUG_ON(spd->nr_pages >= PIPE_BUFFERS);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#386: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1857:
+extern void do_generic_file_read(struct file *filp, loff_t *ppos,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
