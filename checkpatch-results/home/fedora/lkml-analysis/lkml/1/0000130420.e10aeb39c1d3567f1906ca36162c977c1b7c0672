#74: 
Subject: [PATCH 2/2] kbuild, modpost: fix "unexpected non-allocatable" warning with SUSE gcc

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#104: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:730:
 static const char *section_white_list[] =
+	{ ".comment*", ".debug*", ".stab*", ".note*", ".got*", ".toc*", NULL };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
