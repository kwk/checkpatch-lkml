#362: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-bfin-twi.c:252:
+		iface->writeNum = iface->readNum = pmsg->len;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#376: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-bfin-twi.c:266:
+		if (pmsg->flags & I2C_M_RD)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
