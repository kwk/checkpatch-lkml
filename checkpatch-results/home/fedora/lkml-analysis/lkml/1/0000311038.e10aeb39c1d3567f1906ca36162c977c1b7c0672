CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!k"
#65: FILE: fs/char_dev.c:487:
+	if (k == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct kobj_map *' should also have an identifier name
#136: FILE: include/linux/cdev.h:41:
+void cdev_iterate_map(struct kobj_map *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
