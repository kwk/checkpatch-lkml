WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#68: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:1215:
+	struct bio *nxt = bio->bi_next;
+	rq.q = q;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#69: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:1216:
+	rq.bio = rq.biotail = bio;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#142: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:1275:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
