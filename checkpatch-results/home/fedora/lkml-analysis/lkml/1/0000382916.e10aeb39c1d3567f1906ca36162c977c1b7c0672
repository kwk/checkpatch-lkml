#58: 
Changed K8_NUMA from "depends on PCI" to "select PCI", like X86_64_ACPI_NUMA is. This fixes the pseudo dependency between X86_64_ACPI_NUMA and K8_NUMA (i.e. selecting X86_64_ACPI_NUMA would cause PCI to be selected, which then made K8_NUMA visible, because its PCI dependency was now satisfied).
