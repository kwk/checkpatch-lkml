WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#384: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/speedstep-centrino.c:373:
+	if (centrino_cpu_init_table(policy)) {
+		return -ENODEV;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
