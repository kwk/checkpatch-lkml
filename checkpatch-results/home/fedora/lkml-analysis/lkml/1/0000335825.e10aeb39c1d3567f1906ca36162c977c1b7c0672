WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#123: FILE: kernel/module.c:1655:
+	struct module *mod = _mod;
+	list_add(&mod->list, &modules);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Noone' may be misspelled - perhaps 'No one'?

                                           ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#135: FILE: kernel/module.c:2038:
+         * info during argument parsing.  Noone should access us, since$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#136: FILE: kernel/module.c:2039:
+         * strong_try_module_get() will fail. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
