CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Unlock>
#82: FILE: kernel/power/user.c:77:
+		goto Unlock;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#88: FILE: kernel/power/user.c:82:
+		error = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
