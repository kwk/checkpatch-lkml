With 64KB blocksize, a directory entry can have size 64KB which does not fit

into 16 bits we have for entry lenght. So we store 0xffff instead and convert

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#73: FILE: fs/ext2/dir.c:43:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#94: FILE: fs/ext2/dir.c:214:
+	return (ext2_dirent *)((char*)p +

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
