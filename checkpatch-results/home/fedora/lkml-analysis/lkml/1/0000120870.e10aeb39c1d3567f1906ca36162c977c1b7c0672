Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:569:
+extern int perf_counter_init_task(struct task_struct *child);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#157: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:3487:
+		ret = inherit_group(counter, parent, parent_ctx,
+					     child, child_ctx);
