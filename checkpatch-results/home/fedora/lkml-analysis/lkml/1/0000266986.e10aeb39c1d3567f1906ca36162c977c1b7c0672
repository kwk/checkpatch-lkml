In the absence of an explicitly defined passive cooling zone any                                                                                                                                        

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#57: FILE: Documentation/thermal/sysfs-api.txt:202:
+^I^I^I^Icase, polling will be automatically enabled to support it.^I^I^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#91: FILE: drivers/thermal/thermal_sys.c:129:
+	struct thermal_zone_device *tz = to_thermal_zone(dev);
+	return sprintf(buf, "%ld\n", tz->force_passive_temp);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#100: FILE: drivers/thermal/thermal_sys.c:138:
+	int ret = strict_strtoul(buf, 10, &temperature);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_RW: Use DEVICE_ATTR_RW
#125: FILE: drivers/thermal/thermal_sys.c:224:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(passive, 0644, passive_show, passive_store);

The DEVICE_ATTR_RW(name) helper macro can be used instead of
DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0644, name_show, name_store);

Note that the macro automatically appends _show and _store to the
named attribute variable of the device for the show and store methods.

#169: FILE: drivers/thermal/thermal_sys.c:560:
+		/* If the temperature trend is downwards, reduce throttling

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#177: FILE: drivers/thermal/thermal_sys.c:568:
+				} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
