Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#116: FILE: mm/mempool.c:322:
+	size_t size = (size_t) pool_data;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#117: FILE: mm/mempool.c:323:
+	size_t size = (size_t) pool_data;
+	memset(element, 0, size);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
