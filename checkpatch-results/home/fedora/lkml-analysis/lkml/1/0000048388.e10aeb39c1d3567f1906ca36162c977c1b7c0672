#36: 
This one enables the mpc52xx_spi driver for usage of user defined gpio lines

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#88: FILE: drivers/spi/mpc52xx_spi.c:103:
+	if (ms->gpio_cs_count > 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#124: FILE: drivers/spi/mpc52xx_spi.c:456:

+				GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ms->gpio_cs"
#166: FILE: drivers/spi/mpc52xx_spi.c:527:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
