WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'gate_desc *' should also have an identifier name
#125: FILE: include/asm-x86/paravirt.h:103:
+	void (*write_idt_entry)(gate_desc *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#135: FILE: include/asm-x86/paravirt.h:671:
 }
+static inline void write_idt_entry(gate_desc *dt, int entry, gate_desc *g)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
