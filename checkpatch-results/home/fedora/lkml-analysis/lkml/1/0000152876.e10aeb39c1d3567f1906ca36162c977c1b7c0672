Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#124: FILE: arch/microblaze/Kconfig:79:

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#175: FILE: arch/microblaze/Kconfig:130:
+source "arch/microblaze/Kconfig.debug"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#327: FILE: arch/microblaze/platform/generic/Kconfig.auto:17:
+# along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
