CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#310: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2681:
+	for_each_zone(zone) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#315: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2686:
+		zone->pageset = CPU_ALLOC(struct per_cpu_pageset,
+					GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_ZERO);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#315: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2686:
+					GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_ZERO);
 					          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#316: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2687:
+		BUG_ON(!zone->pageset);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#397: FILE: mm/vmstat.c:151:

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
