CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#164: FILE: drivers/ide/mips/au1xxx-ide.c:226:
+	hwif->sg_nents = i = ide_build_sglist(drive, rq);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#198: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1161:
+int ide_build_sglist(ide_drive_t *, struct request *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct request *' should also have an identifier name
#198: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1161:
+int ide_build_sglist(ide_drive_t *, struct request *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#199: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1162:
