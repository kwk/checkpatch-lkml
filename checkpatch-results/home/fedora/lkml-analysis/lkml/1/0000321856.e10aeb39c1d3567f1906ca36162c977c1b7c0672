CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#71: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:322:
+	if (floppy->pc->c[0] == GPCMD_REQUEST_SENSE) {
[...]
-	}
[...]
+			floppy->sense_key = buf[2] & 0x0F;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
