take the BKL, but explicitely in their own source now.
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#102: FILE: fs/ncpfs/file.c:288:
+	loff_t ret;
+	lock_kernel();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#183: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1828:
+extern loff_t remote_llseek_unlocked(struct file *file, loff_t offset,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#184: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1829:
+extern loff_t remote_llseek_unlocked(struct file *file, loff_t offset,
+			int origin);

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#206: FILE: fs/nfs/file.c:178:
+	loff = remote_llseek_unlocked(filp, offset, origin);
