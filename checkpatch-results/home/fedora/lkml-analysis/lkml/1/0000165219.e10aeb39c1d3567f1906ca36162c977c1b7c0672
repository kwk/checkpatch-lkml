ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#82: FILE: drivers/pci/intel-iommu.c:1413:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
