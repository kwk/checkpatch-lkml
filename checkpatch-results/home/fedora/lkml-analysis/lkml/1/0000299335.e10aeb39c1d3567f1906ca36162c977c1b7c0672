WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'balloon_expand', this function's name, in a string
#142: FILE: drivers/xen/balloon.c:192:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "balloon_expand failed: ret = %d\n", ret);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
