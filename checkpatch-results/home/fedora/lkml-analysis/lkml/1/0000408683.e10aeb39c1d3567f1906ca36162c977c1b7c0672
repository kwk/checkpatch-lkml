WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#205: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:725:
+static struct seq_operations proc_pid_numa_maps_op = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
