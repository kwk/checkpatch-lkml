CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pkt"
#80: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ipaq.c:618:
+		if (pkt == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#94: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ipaq.c:665:
+	port->bulk_out_size = port->write_urb->transfer_buffer_length
+							= URBDATA_SIZE;

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bulk_in_endpointAddress>
#106: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ipaq.c:695:
+		usb_rcvbulkpipe(serial->dev, port->bulk_in_endpointAddress),

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
