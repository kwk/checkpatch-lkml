CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#74: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/process.c:13:
+#include <asm/uaccess.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#267: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/process.c:249:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
