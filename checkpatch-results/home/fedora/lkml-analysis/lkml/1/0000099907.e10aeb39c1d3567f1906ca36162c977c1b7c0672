CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Elf_Shdr>
#66: FILE: kernel/module.c:1876:
+	Elf_Shdr *strsect = sechdrs + strindex;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#82: FILE: kernel/module.c:1894:
+			while(!__test_and_set_bit(j, strmap) && strtab[j])

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#130: FILE: kernel/module.c:1953:
+	mod->core_strtab = s = mod->module_core + stroffs;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
