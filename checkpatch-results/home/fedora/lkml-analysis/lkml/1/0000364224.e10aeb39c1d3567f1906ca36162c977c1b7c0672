ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#61: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-clevo-mail.c:96:
+				unsigned long* delay_on,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'clevo_mail_led_blink', this function's name, in a string
#88: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-clevo-mail.c:123:
+		       ": clevo_mail_led_blink(..., %lu, %lu),"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#89: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-clevo-mail.c:124:
+		       ": clevo_mail_led_blink(..., %lu, %lu),"
+		       " returning -EINVAL (unsupported)\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
