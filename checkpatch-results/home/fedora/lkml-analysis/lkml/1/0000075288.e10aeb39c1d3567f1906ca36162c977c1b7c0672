CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#114: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:2039:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#116: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:2041:
+				void *kaddr = kmap(page);
+				stop = ((size += PAGE_SIZE) > limit) ||

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
