CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: include/linux/vmstat.h:169:
+extern unsigned long global_reclaimable_pages(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: include/linux/vmstat.h:170:
+extern unsigned long zone_reclaimable_pages(void);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#168: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:2138:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
