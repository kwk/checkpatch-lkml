WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#21: 
Subject: [tip:tracing/core] tracing, Text Edit Lock: Fix one sparse warning in kernel/extable.c

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#65: FILE: kernel/extable.c:16:
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
