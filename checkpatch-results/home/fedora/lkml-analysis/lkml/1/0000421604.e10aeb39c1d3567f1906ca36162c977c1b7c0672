Ack-ed-by: Jim Keniston <jkenisto@us.ibm.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'address >= (unsigned long)_stext'
#114: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/kprobes.h:95:
+	if (kernel_text_is_ro && ((address >= (unsigned long)_stext)
+					&& (address < (unsigned long) _etext)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

+					&& (address < (unsigned long) _etext)))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
