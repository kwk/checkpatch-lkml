#46: 
hold a pointer to an eventfd object (by virtue of having a waiter registered

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#179: FILE: include/linux/eventfd.h:40:
+#define eventfd_kref_get(file) ERR_PTR(-ENOSYS);

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#179: FILE: include/linux/eventfd.h:40:
+#define eventfd_kref_get(file) ERR_PTR(-ENOSYS);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
