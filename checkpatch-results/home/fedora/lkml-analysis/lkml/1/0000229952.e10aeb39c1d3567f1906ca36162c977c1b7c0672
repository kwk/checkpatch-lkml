Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#149: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/pci_hotplug_core.c:558:
+int pci_hp_register(struct hotplug_slot *slot, struct pci_bus *bus, int slot_nr,
+			const char *name)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#256: FILE: include/linux/pci_hotplug.h:168:
+extern int pci_hp_register(struct hotplug_slot *,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct hotplug_slot *' should also have an identifier name
#256: FILE: include/linux/pci_hotplug.h:168:
+extern int pci_hp_register(struct hotplug_slot *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_bus *' should also have an identifier name
#256: FILE: include/linux/pci_hotplug.h:168:
+extern int pci_hp_register(struct hotplug_slot *,
