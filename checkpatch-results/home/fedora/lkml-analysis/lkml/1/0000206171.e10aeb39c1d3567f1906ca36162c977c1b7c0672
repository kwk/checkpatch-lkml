WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#73: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:1716:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!qc"
#157: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:4639:
+	WARN_ON(qc == NULL);	/* ata_qc_from_tag _might_ return NULL */

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#227: FILE: drivers/ata/libata.h:77:
+extern struct ata_queued_cmd *ata_qc_new_init(struct ata_device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#235: FILE: drivers/ata/libata.h:106:
+extern void ata_qc_free(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc);
