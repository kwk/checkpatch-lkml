WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#42: FILE: :166:
+	pr_debug("%s: alt table %p -> %p\n", __FUNCTION__, start, end);

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

(u8*)__pa_symbol(&__vsyscall_0));

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
