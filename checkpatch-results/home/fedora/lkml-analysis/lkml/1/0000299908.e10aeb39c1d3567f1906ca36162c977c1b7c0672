# HG changeset patch

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#124: FILE: mm/memory.c:1648:
+		old_page = new_page = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
