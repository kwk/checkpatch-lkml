CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#75: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:1127:
+	put_unaligned(cpu_to_be32(block), (unsigned int *) &pc->c[2]);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#100: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:1331:
+		blocks = descriptor->blocks = be32_to_cpu(descriptor->blocks);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#101: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:1332:
+		length = descriptor->length = be16_to_cpu(descriptor->length);
