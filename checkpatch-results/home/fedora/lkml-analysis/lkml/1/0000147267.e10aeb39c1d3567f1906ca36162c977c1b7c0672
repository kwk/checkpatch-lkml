#32: 
 decrement_counters_in_path() is exactly the same function as pathrelse(), so

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#259: FILE: fs/reiserfs/stree.c:370:
+ * This version should only be called from fix_nodes() */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#275: FILE: fs/reiserfs/stree.c:381:
+		struct buffer_head *bh;
+		bh = PATH_OFFSET_PBUFFER(p_s_search_path, n_path_offset--);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
