ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#112: 
--- a/linux/drivers/media/video/videodev.c	Tue May 27 16:02:56 2008 -0300

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Statements, such as::

should be::
