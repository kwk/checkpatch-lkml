WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#52: FILE: kernel/irq/proc.c:153:
+	struct irq_desc *desc = irq_to_desc((long) m->private);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#53: FILE: kernel/irq/proc.c:154:
+	struct irq_desc *desc = irq_to_desc((long) m->private);
+	seq_printf(m, "count %u\n"

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
