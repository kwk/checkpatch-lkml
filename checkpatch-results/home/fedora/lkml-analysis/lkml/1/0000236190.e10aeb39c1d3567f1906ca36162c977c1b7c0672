Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:BAD_STABLE_ADDRESS_STYLE: Invalid email format for stable: '<stable@kernel.org>		[2.6.25.x, 2.6.26.x]', prefer 'stable@kernel.org # 2.6.25.x, 2.6.26.x'
#247: 
Cc: <stable@kernel.org>		[2.6.25.x, 2.6.26.x]

The email format for stable is incorrect.
Some valid options for stable address are::

  1. stable@vger.kernel.org
  2. stable@kernel.org

For adding version info, the following comment style should be used::

  stable@vger.kernel.org # version info

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
