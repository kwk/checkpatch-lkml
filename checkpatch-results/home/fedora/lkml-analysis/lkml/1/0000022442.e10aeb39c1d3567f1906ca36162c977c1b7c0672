To fully understand what could happen with old code, I write a debug patch like following:

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#64: FILE: arch/x86/mm/srat_64.c:293:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "SRAT: Node %u oldnode: %lx-%lx\n", node,

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#76: FILE: arch/x86/mm/srat_64.c:304:
