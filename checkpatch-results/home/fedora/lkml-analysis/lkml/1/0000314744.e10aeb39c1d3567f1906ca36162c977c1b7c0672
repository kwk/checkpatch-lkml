ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#84: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:870:
unsigned int good_bytes)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#89: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:874:
+		req->data_len = req->raw_data_len = scsi_get_resid(cmd);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
