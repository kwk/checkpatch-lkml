WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#137: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm.h:312:
+#define KVM_VCPU_MMIO 			\
+	int mmio_needed;		\
+	int mmio_read_completed;	\
+	int mmio_is_write;		\
+	int mmio_size;			\
+	unsigned char mmio_data[8];	\
 	gpa_t mmio_phys_addr;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
