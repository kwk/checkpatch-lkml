WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#206: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:868:
+ * */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#219: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:881:
+	cq->front = cq->rear = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#259: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:921:
+static inline void mark_lock_accessed(struct lock_list *lock,
+					struct lock_list *parent)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#262: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:924:
+	unsigned long nr;
+	nr = lock - list_entries;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
