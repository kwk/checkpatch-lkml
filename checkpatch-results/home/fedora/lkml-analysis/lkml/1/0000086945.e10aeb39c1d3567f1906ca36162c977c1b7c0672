Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#133: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_counter.c:48:
+#define X86_DEBUGCTL_TR			(1 << 6)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "x86_pmu.enable_bts"
#191: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_counter.c:711:
+	return x86_pmu.enable_bts != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#275: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_counter.c:795:
+	if (err)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#277: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_counter.c:797:
+	else {

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'event ==
 		      x86_pmu.event_map(PERF_COUNT_HW_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS)'
#443: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_counter.c:1313:
+	if (unlikely((event ==
+		      x86_pmu.event_map(PERF_COUNT_HW_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS)) &&
+		     (hwc->sample_period == 1)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'hwc->sample_period == 1'
#443: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_counter.c:1313:
+	if (unlikely((event ==
+		      x86_pmu.event_map(PERF_COUNT_HW_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS)) &&
+		     (hwc->sample_period == 1)))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#596: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:695:
+extern void perf_counter_output(struct perf_counter *counter, int nmi,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#619: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:2635:
+void perf_counter_output(struct perf_counter *counter, int nmi,
 				struct perf_sample_data *data)
