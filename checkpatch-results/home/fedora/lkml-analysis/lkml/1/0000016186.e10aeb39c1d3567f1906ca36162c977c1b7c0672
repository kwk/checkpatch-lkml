WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'acknowledgement' may be misspelled - perhaps 'acknowledgment'?
#49: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_iseries.c:356:
+			"hvc: got unexpected close acknowledgement\n");
 			                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#110: FILE: drivers/scsi/libfc/fc_fcp.c:51:
+#define FC_SRB_ABORTED		(1 << 3)	/* abort acknowledged */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#143: FILE: include/linux/hil.h:171:
+^IHIL_CMD_AK1^I= 0x48,^I/* Acknowledge1 */  $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
