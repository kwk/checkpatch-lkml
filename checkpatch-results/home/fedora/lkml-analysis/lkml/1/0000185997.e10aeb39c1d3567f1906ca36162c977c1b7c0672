Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#428: FILE: kernel/fork.c:849:
+	sig->maxrss = sig->cmaxrss = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#475: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1685:
+		struct mm_struct *mm = get_task_mm(p);
+		if (mm) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
