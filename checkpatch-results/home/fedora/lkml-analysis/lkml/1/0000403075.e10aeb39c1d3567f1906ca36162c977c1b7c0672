ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#104: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/suspend.c:96:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#119: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/desc.h:26:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
