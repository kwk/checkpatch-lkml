CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#112: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-stat.c:202:
+				EID(PERF_TYPE_SOFTWARE, PERF_COUNT_TASK_CLOCK)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
