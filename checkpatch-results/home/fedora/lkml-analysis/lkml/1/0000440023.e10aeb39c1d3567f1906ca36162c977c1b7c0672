WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#64: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1985:
+	REG("container",  S_IRUGO, container),

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#87: FILE: kernel/container.c:250:
+struct file_operations proc_containerstats_operations;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#153: FILE: kernel/container.c:1573:
+		if (!root->subsys_bits) continue;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

#179: FILE: kernel/container.c:1599:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
