CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: include/linux/lockdep.h:306:
+extern int lock_is_held(struct lockdep_map *lock);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#125: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:2632:
+       ^Iint i;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#125: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:2632:
+       ^Iint i;$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#125: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:2632:
+       ^Iint i;$

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#136: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:2643:

 	              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#178: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:2781:

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
