WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct backlight_ops should normally be const
#101: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/mbp_nvidia_bl.c:33:
+	struct backlight_ops backlight_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after mbp_device_table[]
#187: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/mbp_nvidia_bl.c:113:
+static const struct dmi_system_id __initdata mbp_device_table[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of const init definition must use __initconst
#187: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/mbp_nvidia_bl.c:113:
+static const struct dmi_system_id __initdata mbp_device_table[] = {

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.
