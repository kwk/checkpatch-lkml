In other words, "a char equals zero is never a space". So remove this check.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#64: FILE: include/linux/string.h:65:
+extern char * __must_check skip_spaces(const char *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
