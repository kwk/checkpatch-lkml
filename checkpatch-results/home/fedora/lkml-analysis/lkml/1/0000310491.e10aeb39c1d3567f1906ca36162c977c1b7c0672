Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#138: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1480:
+extern int security_module_enable(struct security_operations *ops);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after chosen_lsm[SECURITY_NAME_MAX + 1]
#166: FILE: security/security.c:21:
+static __initdata char chosen_lsm[SECURITY_NAME_MAX + 1];

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
