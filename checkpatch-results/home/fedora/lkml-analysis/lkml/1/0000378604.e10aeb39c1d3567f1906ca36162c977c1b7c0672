#72: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:312:
+extern void tty_termios_encode_baud_rate(struct ktermios *termios, speed_t ibaud, speed_t obaud);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#141: FILE: drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:274:
+			else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
