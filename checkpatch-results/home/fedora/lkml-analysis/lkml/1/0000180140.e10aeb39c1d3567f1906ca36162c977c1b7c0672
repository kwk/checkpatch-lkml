WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#65: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-devsets.c:1:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: DEFINE_MUTEX definition without comment
#69: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-devsets.c:5:
+DEFINE_MUTEX(ide_setting_mtx);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!drive->hwif->dma_ops"
#114: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-devsets.c:50:
+	if (drive->hwif->dma_ops == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#119: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-devsets.c:55:
+	if (arg) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#169: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-devsets.c:105:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#476: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1171:
+ide_startstop_t ide_do_devset(ide_drive_t *, struct request *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct request *' should also have an identifier name
#476: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1171:
