WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config RTC_DRV_M41TXX_WDT

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'mulitplier' may be misspelled - perhaps 'multiplier'?
#121: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-m41txx.c:252:

 		                   ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#123: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-m41txx.c:254:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'we'
#175: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-m41txx.c:306:
+ *	write of data will do, as we we don't define content meaning.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#181: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-m41txx.c:312:
+	/*  Can't seek (pwrite) on this device
+	if (ppos != &file->f_pos)

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
