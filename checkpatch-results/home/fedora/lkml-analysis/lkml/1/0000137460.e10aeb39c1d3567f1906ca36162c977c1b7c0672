WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#54: FILE: arch/m68k/amiga/platform.c:74:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#100: FILE: drivers/scsi/a4000t.c:38:
+	struct Scsi_Host *host;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <NCR_700_Host_Parameters>
#115: FILE: drivers/scsi/a4000t.c:48:
+	hostdata = kzalloc(sizeof(struct NCR_700_Host_Parameters),

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*hostdata)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct NCR_700_Host_Parameters)...)
#115: FILE: drivers/scsi/a4000t.c:48:
+	hostdata = kzalloc(sizeof(struct NCR_700_Host_Parameters),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#243: FILE: drivers/scsi/a4000t.c:134:
+MODULE_AUTHOR("Alan Hourihane <alanh@fairlite.demon.co.uk> / "
+	      "Kars de Jong <jongk@linux-m68k.org>");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
