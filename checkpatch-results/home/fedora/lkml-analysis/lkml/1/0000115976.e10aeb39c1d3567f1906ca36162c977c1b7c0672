CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*node)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct acpi_handle_node)...)
#95: FILE: drivers/acpi/pci_root.c:366:
+		node = kzalloc(sizeof(struct acpi_handle_node), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#121: FILE: drivers/acpi/pci_root.c:392:
+		acpi_handle hnd = node->handle;
+		status = acpi_evaluate_integer(hnd, "_ADR", NULL, &adr);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'acpi_handle' should also have an identifier name
#153: FILE: include/acpi/acpi_drivers.h:100:
+struct pci_dev *acpi_get_pci_dev(acpi_handle);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
