#61: 
--- a/drivers/dma/ioat_dma.c~i-oat-add-completion-callback-for-async_tx-interface-use-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ioat_dma_test_callback', this function's name, in a string
#73: FILE: drivers/dma/ioat_dma.c:659:
+	printk(KERN_ERR "ioatdma: ioat_dma_test_callback(0x%p)\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
