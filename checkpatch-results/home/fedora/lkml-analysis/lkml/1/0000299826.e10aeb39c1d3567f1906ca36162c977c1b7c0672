WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#17: 
Subject: [PATCH 7/7] asm-generic: suppress sparse warning in ioctl.h

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'non-existant' may be misspelled - perhaps 'non-existent'?
#38: 
Instead of using a non-existant extern function, use 1/0 as the guard
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#61: FILE: include/asm-generic/ioctl.h:53:
+	  sizeof(t) : 1/0)
