ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#44: 
--- a/mm/filemap.c~readahead-improve-heuristic-detecting-sequential-reads-tidy

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#50: FILE: mm/filemap.c:936:
+		prev_offset = ra.offset = offset;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
