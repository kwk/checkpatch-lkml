+dummy MSDOS partition containing one disk-sized partition.  This is what is
       ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#204: FILE: fs/partitions/ldm.c:135:
+	BUG_ON(!data || !ph);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#205: FILE: fs/partitions/ldm.c:136:
+	if (MAGIC_PRIVHEAD != BE64(data)) {

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#232: FILE: fs/partitions/ldm.c:152:
+		ldm_error("Expected PRIVHEAD version 2.11 or 2.12, got %d.%d."
+			" Aborting.", ph->ver_major, ph->ver_minor);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'ph->logical_disk_size == 0'

+	if ((ph->logical_disk_size == 0) || (ph->logical_disk_start +

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.

  char *linux_banner;

  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
