ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#76: FILE: drivers/char/pc8736x_gpio.c:40:
+static struct superio* gate;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#82: FILE: drivers/char/pc8736x_gpio.c:42:
+static __devinit struct superio_search where = {

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __devinit should be placed after where
#82: FILE: drivers/char/pc8736x_gpio.c:42:
+static __devinit struct superio_search where = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
