ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#181: FILE: kernel/hw_breakpoint.c:272:
+static int inline dbg_hw_breakpoint_alloc(int cpu)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

+}
+static void inline dbg_hw_breakpoint_free(int cpu)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#224: FILE: include/linux/hw_breakpoint.h:80:
+extern int _dbg_hw_breakpoint_all_alloc(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
