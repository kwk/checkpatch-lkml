Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*nl)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct nolock_lockspace)...)
#138: FILE: fs/gfs2/locking.c:134:
+	nl = kzalloc(sizeof(struct nolock_lockspace), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
