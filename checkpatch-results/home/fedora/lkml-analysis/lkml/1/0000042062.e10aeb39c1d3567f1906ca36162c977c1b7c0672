CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!kernel_map__functions"
#197: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1509:
+	if (kernel_map__functions == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#201: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1512:
+	kernel_map__functions->map_ip	 = kernel_map__functions->unmap_ip = identity__map_ip;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
