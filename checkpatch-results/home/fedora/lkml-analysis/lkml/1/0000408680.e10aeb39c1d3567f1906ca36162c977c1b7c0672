WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct gss_api_mech *' should also have an identifier name
#55: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/gss_api.h:61:
+u32 gss_svc_to_pseudoflavor(struct gss_api_mech *, u32 service);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#84: FILE: net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_mech_switch.c:208:
+		if (gm->gm_pfs[i].service == service) {
+			return gm->gm_pfs[i].pseudoflavor;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
