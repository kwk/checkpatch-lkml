CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around spu_working.spu_dma_work
#62: FILE: sound/sh/aica.c:324:
+		PREPARE_WORK(&(spu_working.spu_dma_work), run_spu_dma);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#64: FILE: sound/sh/aica.c:326:
+	}
+	else {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#64: FILE: sound/sh/aica.c:326:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
