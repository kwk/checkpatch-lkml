WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#92: FILE: arch/x86/configs/i386_defconfig:10:
+CONFIG_ARCH_DEFCONFIG="arch/x86/configs/i386_defconfig"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#2046: FILE: kernel/smp.c:214:
+	/* prevent preemption and reschedule on another processor,
+	   as well as CPU removal */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
