+	---help---
+	  This option enables device driver support for Atmel Syncronized
+	  Serial Communication peripheral (SSC).
+
+	  The SSC peripheral supports a wide variety of serial frame based
+	  communications, i.e. I2S, SPI, etc.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ssc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ssc_device)...)
#164: FILE: drivers/misc/atmel-ssc.c:76:
+	ssc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ssc_device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
