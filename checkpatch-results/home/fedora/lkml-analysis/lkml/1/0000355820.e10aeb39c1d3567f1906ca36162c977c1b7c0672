WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'udc_queue', this function's name, in a string
#74: FILE: drivers/usb/gadget/amd5536udc.c:1247:
+				DBG(dev, "udc_queue(): pending bytes in "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#87: FILE: drivers/usb/gadget/m66592-udc.c:712:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "pipe0 is busy. maybe cpu i/o bus "

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#100: FILE: drivers/usb/gadget/net2280.c:2438:
+			VDEBUG (dev, "setup %02x.%02x v%04x i%04x l%04x "

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
