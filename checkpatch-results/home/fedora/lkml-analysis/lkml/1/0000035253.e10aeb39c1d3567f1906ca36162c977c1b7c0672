Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#344: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-sched.c:1529:
+		trace_handler->runtime_event(&runtime_event, session, event, cpu, timestamp, thread);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
