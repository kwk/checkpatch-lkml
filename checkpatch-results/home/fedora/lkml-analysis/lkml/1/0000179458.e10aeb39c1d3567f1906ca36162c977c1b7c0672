Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#270: FILE: include/linux/quota.h:313:
+	int (*reserve_space) (struct inode *, qsize_t, int);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#270: FILE: include/linux/quota.h:313:
+	int (*reserve_space) (struct inode *, qsize_t, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'qsize_t' should also have an identifier name
#270: FILE: include/linux/quota.h:313:
+	int (*reserve_space) (struct inode *, qsize_t, int);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
