WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#46: FILE: fs/logfs/file.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#47: FILE: fs/logfs/file.c:2:
+ * fs/logfs/file.c	- prepare_write, commit_write and friends

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#56: FILE: fs/logfs/file.c:11:
+static int logfs_prepare_write(struct file *file, struct page *page,
+		unsigned start, unsigned end)

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#56: FILE: fs/logfs/file.c:11:
+		unsigned start, unsigned end)

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#56: FILE: fs/logfs/file.c:11:
+		unsigned start, unsigned end)

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'start == 0'
#61: FILE: fs/logfs/file.c:16:
+	if ((start == 0) && (end == PAGE_CACHE_SIZE))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#75: FILE: fs/logfs/file.c:30:
+	BUG_ON(PAGE_CACHE_SIZE != inode->i_sb->s_blocksize);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#75: FILE: fs/logfs/file.c:30:
+	BUG_ON(PAGE_CACHE_SIZE != inode->i_sb->s_blocksize);

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
