WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Acked-by:' is the preferred signature form
#39: 
Acked-By: Rene Herman <rene.herman@gmail.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pnp_protocol *' should also have an identifier name
#55: FILE: drivers/pnp/base.h:6:
+struct pnp_card *pnp_alloc_card(struct pnp_protocol *, int id, char *pnpid);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*card)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pnp_card)...)
#72: FILE: drivers/pnp/card.c:159:
+	card = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pnp_card), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
