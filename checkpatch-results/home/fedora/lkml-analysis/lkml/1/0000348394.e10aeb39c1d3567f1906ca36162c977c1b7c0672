ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#76: 
--- a/drivers/media/video/usbvision/usbvision-video.c~media-video-usbvision-add-mutex_unlock-to-error-paths-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
