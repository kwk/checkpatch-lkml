WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#44: FILE: drivers/gpio/Kconfig:70:
+config GPIO_PL061
+	bool "PrimeCell PL061 GPIO support"
+	help
+	  Say yes here to support the PrimeCell PL061 GPIO device
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#65: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#70: FILE: drivers/gpio/pl061.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#71: FILE: drivers/gpio/pl061.c:2:
+ *  linux/drivers/gpio/pl061.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#240: FILE: drivers/gpio/pl061.c:171:

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
