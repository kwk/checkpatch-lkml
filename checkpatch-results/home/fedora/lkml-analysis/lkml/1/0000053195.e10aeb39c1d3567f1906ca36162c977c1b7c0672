WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+	 * into the skb data or cb now. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#199: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ipw2x00/libipw.h:1023:
+extern void unregister_ieee80211(struct libipw_device *ieee);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
