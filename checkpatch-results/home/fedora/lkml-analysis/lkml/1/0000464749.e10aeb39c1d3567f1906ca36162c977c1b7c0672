Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#302: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c:1815:
+	r = n = __msr_io(vcpu, &msrs, entries, do_msr);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#386: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c:1890:
+static struct file_operations kvm_vcpu_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:DEFAULT_NO_BREAK: switch default: should use break

switch default case is sometimes written as "default:;".  This can
cause new cases added below default to be defective.

A "break;" should be added after empty default statement to avoid
unwanted fallthrough.
