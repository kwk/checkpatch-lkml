WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#30: 
 arch/m68k/include/asm/{dma_no.h => dma.h} |   19 ++++++++-----------

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#64: FILE: arch/m68k/include/asm/dma.h:481:
+/* it's useless on the m68k, but unfortunately needed by the new
+   bootmem allocator (but this should do it for this) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#64: FILE: arch/m68k/include/asm/dma.h:481:
+   bootmem allocator (but this should do it for this) */

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#71: FILE: arch/m68k/include/asm/dma.h:486:
+extern int request_dma(unsigned int dmanr, const char * device_id);	/* reserve a DMA channel */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: arch/m68k/include/asm/dma.h:486:
+extern int request_dma(unsigned int dmanr, const char * device_id);	/* reserve a DMA channel */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
