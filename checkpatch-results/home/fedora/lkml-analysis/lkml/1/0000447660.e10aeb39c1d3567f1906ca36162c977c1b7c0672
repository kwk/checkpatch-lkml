#27: 
Most of asm-x86_64/bugs.h is code which should be in a C file, so put it there.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#57: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/bugs.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#58: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/bugs.c:2:
+ *  arch/x86_64/kernel/bugs.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#71: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/bugs.c:15:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#80: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/bugs.c:24:
+	printk("CPU: ");

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#92: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/alternative.h:19:
+extern void alternative_instructions(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
