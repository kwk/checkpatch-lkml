CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#45: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:276:
+extern void setup_hostinfo(char *buf, int len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SIZEOF_PARENTHESIS: sizeof host_info should be sizeof(host_info)
#89: FILE: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c:490:
+	setup_hostinfo(host_info, sizeof host_info);
