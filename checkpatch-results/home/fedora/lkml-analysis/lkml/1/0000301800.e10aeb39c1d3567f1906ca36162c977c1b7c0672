WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#110: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_net.c:788:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "buffer2 not NULL: %p.\n", buffer2);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cptr->info->set_value"
#226: FILE: drivers/media/video/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-ctrl.c:268:
+	return cptr->info->set_value != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#239: FILE: drivers/media/video/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-hdw.c:2294:
+		if (!cptr->info->is_dirty) continue;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'hdw->fw_buffer == NULL'
#248: FILE: drivers/media/video/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-hdw.c:2649:
+		if ((hdw->fw_buffer == NULL) == !enable_flag) break;

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#248: FILE: drivers/media/video/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-hdw.c:2649:
+		if ((hdw->fw_buffer == NULL) == !enable_flag) break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hdw->fw_buffer"
#248: FILE: drivers/media/video/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-hdw.c:2649:
+		if ((hdw->fw_buffer == NULL) == !enable_flag) break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "hdw->fw_buffer"
#257: FILE: drivers/media/video/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-hdw.c:2718:
+	return hdw->fw_buffer != NULL;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#270: FILE: drivers/media/video/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-io.c:566:
+		while ((bp = pvr2_stream_get_ready_buffer(sp)) != NULL) {
 			pvr2_buffer_set_idle(bp);
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
