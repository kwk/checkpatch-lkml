Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#167: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:3716:
+	BUG_ON(var_free_kbytes < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#181: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:3730:
+		struct page *page = alloc_pages_node(node, GFP_KERNEL, 0);
+		if (!page)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
