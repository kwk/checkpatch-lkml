CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:810:
+extern void remap_file_mappings(struct file *file, struct vm_operations_struct *vm_ops);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#75: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:810:
+extern void remap_file_mappings(struct file *file, struct vm_operations_struct *vm_ops);

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
