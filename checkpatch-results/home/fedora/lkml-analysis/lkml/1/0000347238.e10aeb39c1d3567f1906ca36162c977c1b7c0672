CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:172:
+extern int non_init_kernel_text_address(unsigned long addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+extern int non_init_core_kernel_text(unsigned long addr);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "module_text_address"
#98: FILE: kernel/extable.c:80:
+	return module_text_address(addr) != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
