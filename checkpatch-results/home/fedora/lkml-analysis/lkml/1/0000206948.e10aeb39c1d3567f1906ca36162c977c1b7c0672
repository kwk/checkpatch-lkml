WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

+	unsigned i;

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#135: FILE: security/commoncap.c:268:
+	cpu_caps->magic_etc = magic_etc = le32_to_cpu(caps.magic_etc);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_notice([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_notice(dev, ... then pr_notice(...  to printk(KERN_NOTICE ...
#217: FILE: security/commoncap.c:311:

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#218: FILE: security/commoncap.c:312:
