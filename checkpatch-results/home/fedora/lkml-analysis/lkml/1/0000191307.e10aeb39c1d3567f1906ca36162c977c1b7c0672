Subject: [PATCH] [Target_Core_Mod/PSCSI]: Grab temporary pointer to struct block_device for BIO for v2.6.28

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

+static inline struct bio *pscsi_get_bio (pscsi_dev_virt_t *pdv, int sg_num)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#113: FILE: drivers/lio-core/target_core_pscsi.c:1195:

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

#137: FILE: drivers/lio-core/target_core_pscsi.c:1255:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#146: FILE: drivers/lio-core/target_core_pscsi.c:1263:
+					tbio = tbio->bi_next = bio;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
