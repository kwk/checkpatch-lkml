WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'sturctures' may be misspelled - perhaps 'structures'?
#35: 
The internal ftrace sturctures on the other hand are more manually
                    ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#77: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_export.c:22:
+extern void __bad_type_size(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
