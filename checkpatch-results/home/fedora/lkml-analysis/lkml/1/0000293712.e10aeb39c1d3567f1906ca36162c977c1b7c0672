CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#89: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c:955:
+			res->start = res->end = ret;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

+			res->start = res->end = ret;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#158: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c:1000:
+			int irq = res->start;
+			if (irq == 2)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
