WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'lowmem_shrink', this function's name, in a string
#77: FILE: drivers/staging/android/lowmemorykiller.c:76:
+		lowmem_print(3, "lowmem_shrink %d, %x, ofree %d, ma %d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#110: FILE: drivers/staging/android/lowmemorykiller.c:97:
+				lowmem_print(2, "select %d (%s), adj %d, "
+					     "size %d, to kill\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
