WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#60: 
# size */bn*.o

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

#100: FILE: drivers/net/bnx2.c:2780:
+	 * is stripped, 32-bit unpacked size (LE) is prepended instead */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!gunzip_buf"
#110: FILE: drivers/net/bnx2.c:2788:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!strm"
#113: FILE: drivers/net/bnx2.c:2791:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!strm->workspace"

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#129: FILE: drivers/net/bnx2.c:2803:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#131: FILE: drivers/net/bnx2.c:2805:

#233: FILE: drivers/net/bnx2.c:2876:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#233: FILE: drivers/net/bnx2.c:2876:
+		rc = bnx2_gunzip(fw->gz_text, fw->gz_text_len, (void*) &text);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
