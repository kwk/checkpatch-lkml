CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#50: FILE: include/linux/kvm.h:21:
+#define KVM_TRC_ENTRYEXIT       (1 << KVM_TRC_SHIFT)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#117: FILE: include/linux/kvm.h:86:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
