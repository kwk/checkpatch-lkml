CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#105: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device.c:456:
+	if (cdev->private->state == DEV_STATE_DISCONNECTED) {
[...]
+	} else if (cdev->online && cdev->drv && cdev->drv->set_offline)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cdev->private->state == DEV_STATE_OFFLINE'
#246: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device.c:1269:
+	if (is_blacklisted(id->ssid, id->devno) &&
+	    (cdev->private->state == DEV_STATE_OFFLINE)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.
