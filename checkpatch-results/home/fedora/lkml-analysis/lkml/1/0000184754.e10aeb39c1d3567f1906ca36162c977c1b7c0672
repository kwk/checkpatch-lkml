CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#71: FILE: drivers/pci/dmar.c:694:
+			memcpy(&qi->desc[index], &qi->desc[wait_index],
+					sizeof(struct qi_desc));

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#73: FILE: drivers/pci/dmar.c:696:
+			__iommu_flush_cache(iommu, &qi->desc[index],
+					sizeof(struct qi_desc));

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#289: FILE: include/linux/intel-iommu.h:198:
+#define DMA_FSTS_IQE (1 << 4)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#298: FILE: include/linux/intel-iommu.h:334:
+extern int qi_submit_sync(struct qi_desc *desc, struct intel_iommu *iommu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
