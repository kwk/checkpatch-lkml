CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#113: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/airq.c:81:
+	if (ret < 0) {
[...]
-	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'adapter_int_handler_t' should also have an identifier name
#242: FILE: include/asm-s390/airq.h:16:
+void *s390_register_adapter_interrupt(adapter_int_handler_t, void *, u8);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
