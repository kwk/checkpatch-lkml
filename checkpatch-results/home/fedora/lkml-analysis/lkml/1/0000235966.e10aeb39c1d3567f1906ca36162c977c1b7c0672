+extern void __setup_cpu_750gx(unsigned long offset, struct cpu_spec* spec);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#57: FILE: powerpc/kernel/cputable.c:45:
+extern void __setup_cpu_750gx(unsigned long offset, struct cpu_spec* spec);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
