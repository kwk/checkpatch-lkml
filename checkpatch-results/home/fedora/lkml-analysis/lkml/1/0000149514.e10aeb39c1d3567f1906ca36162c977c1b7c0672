CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: include/linux/rcupreempt.h:43:
+extern void rcu_qsctr_inc(int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
