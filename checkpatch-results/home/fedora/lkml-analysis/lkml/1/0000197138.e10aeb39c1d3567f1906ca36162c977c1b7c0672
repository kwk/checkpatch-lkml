WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#81: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:691:
+__rb_data_page_index(struct buffer_data_page *page, unsigned index)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#102: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:2250:
+	     head += rb_event_length(event)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
