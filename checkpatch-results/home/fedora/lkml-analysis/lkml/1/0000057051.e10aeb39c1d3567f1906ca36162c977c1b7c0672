Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#126: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1841:
+	dir->i_ctime = dir->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
