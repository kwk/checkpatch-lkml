+extern struct resource code_resource, data_resource, bss_resource;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
