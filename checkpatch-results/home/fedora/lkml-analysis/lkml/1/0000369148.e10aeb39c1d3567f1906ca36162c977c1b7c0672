ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#52: FILE: net/ipv4/ip_gre.c:1032:
	return 0;

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#65: FILE: net/ipv4/ip_gre.c:1094:
+	struct iphdr *iph = (struct iphdr *) skb_mac_header(skb);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#66: FILE: net/ipv4/ip_gre.c:1095:
+	struct iphdr *iph = (struct iphdr *) skb_mac_header(skb);
+	memcpy(haddr, &iph->saddr, 4);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
