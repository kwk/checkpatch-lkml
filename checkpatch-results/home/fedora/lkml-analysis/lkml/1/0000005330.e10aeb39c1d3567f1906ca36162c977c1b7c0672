CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*desc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct coh901318_desc)...)
#51: FILE: drivers/dma/coh901318.c:338:
+		desc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct coh901318_desc), GFP_NOWAIT);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
