WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#73: FILE: include/asm-generic/mman.h:1:
+#ifndef __ASM_GENERIC_MMAN_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#85: FILE: include/asm-generic/mman.h:13:
+#define MAP_STACK^I0x20000^I^I/* give out an address that is best suited for $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#86: FILE: include/asm-generic/mman.h:13:
process/thread stacks */

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#87: FILE: include/asm-generic/mman.h:14:
+#define MAP_STACK	0x20000		/* give out an address that is best suited for 
+

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
