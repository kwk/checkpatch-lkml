WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it

Subject: Re: checkpatch vs. checkpatch --file (was: Re: [Orinoco-devel] [PATCH] orinoco: checkpatch cleanup)

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#800: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco/hermes.c:252:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
