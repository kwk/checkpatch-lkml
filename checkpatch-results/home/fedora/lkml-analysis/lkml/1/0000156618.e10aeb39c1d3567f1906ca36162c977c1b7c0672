WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#36: 
# echo function_graph > current_tracer

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:ARRAY_SIZE: Prefer ARRAY_SIZE(hide_symbols)

The ARRAY_SIZE(foo) macro should be preferred over
sizeof(foo)/sizeof(foo[0]) for finding number of elements in an
array.

The macro is defined in include/linux/kernel.h::

  #define ARRAY_SIZE(x) (sizeof(x) / sizeof((x)[0]))
