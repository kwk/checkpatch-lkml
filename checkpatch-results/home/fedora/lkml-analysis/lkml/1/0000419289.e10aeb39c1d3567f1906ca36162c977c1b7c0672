WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#159: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_sysfs.c:257:
+static CLASS_DEVICE_ATTR(link_power_management_policy, S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

#200: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_host.h:360:
+	int (*set_link_pm_policy)(struct Scsi_Host *, enum scsi_host_link_pm);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#219: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_host.h:769:
+extern int scsi_host_set_link_pm(struct Scsi_Host *, enum scsi_host_link_pm);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
