WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#60: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:890:
+	BUG_ON(size < 0 || size % tape->blk_size);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#177: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1277:
+			retval = idetape_add_chrdev_write_request(drive,
