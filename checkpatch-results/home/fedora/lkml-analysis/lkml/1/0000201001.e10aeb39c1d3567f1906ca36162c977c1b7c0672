ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#46: 
--- a/block/blk-merge.c

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#52: FILE: block/blk-merge.c:491:
+	static int count = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#53: FILE: block/blk-merge.c:492:
+	static int count = 0;
+	count++;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
