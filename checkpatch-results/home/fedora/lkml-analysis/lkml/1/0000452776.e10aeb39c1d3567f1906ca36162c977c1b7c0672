Well... changing the Changelog wont help I'm afraid.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#138: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1411:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "loop: invalid max_loop (must be > 1)"

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#139: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1412:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "loop: invalid max_loop (must be > 1)"
+				    ", using default (8)\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#159: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1419:
+	loop_dev = kmalloc(max_loop * sizeof(struct loop_device *), GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*lo)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct loop_device)...)
#171: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1428:
+		lo = kzalloc(sizeof(struct loop_device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
