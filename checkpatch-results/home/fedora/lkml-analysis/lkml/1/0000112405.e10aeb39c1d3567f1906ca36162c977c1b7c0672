CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/mutex.h:153:
+extern int atomic_dec_and_mutex_lock(atomic_t *cnt, struct mutex *lock);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#83: FILE: include/linux/spinlock_up.h:63:
+# define __raw_spin_lock_flags(lock, flags)	do { (void)(lock); } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
