ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#217: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/tsc.c:138:
+	while ((inb(0x61) & 0x20) == 0);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#274: FILE: include/asm-i386/tsc.h:75:
+extern void tsc_calibrate(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
