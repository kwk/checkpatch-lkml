Commit 8e3747c1 ("perf_counter: Change data head from u32 to u64")

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#78: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:2237:
+		offset = head = atomic_long_read(&data->head);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
