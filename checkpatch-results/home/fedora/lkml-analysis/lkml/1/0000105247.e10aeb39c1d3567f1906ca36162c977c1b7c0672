CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#179: FILE: include/linux/percpu.h:76:
+extern ssize_t __init pcpu_4k_first_chunk(

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'funtion' may be misspelled - perhaps 'function'?
#222: FILE: mm/percpu.c:1291:
+ * @free_fn: funtion to free percpu page, always called with PAGE_SIZE
              ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#261: FILE: mm/percpu.c:1330:
+				pr_warning("PERCPU: failed to allocate "
+					   "4k page for cpu%u\n", cpu);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
