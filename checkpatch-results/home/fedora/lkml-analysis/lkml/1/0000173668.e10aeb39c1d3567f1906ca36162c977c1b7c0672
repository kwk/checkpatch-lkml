CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#208: FILE: drivers/usb/core/usb.h:16:
+extern void usb_disable_endpoint(struct usb_device *dev, unsigned int epaddr,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
