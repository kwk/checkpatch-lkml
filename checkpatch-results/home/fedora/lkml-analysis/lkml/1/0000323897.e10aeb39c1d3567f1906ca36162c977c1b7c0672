#37: 
Add preempt off timings. A lot of kernel core code is taken from the RT patch

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#93: FILE: include/linux/ftrace.h:63:
+  extern void notrace trace_preempt_off(unsigned long a0, unsigned long a1);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
