WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#67: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#72: FILE: drivers/soc/soc-core.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#73: FILE: drivers/soc/soc-core.c:2:
+ * drivers/soc/soc-core.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#101: FILE: drivers/soc/soc-core.c:30:
+		struct resource *res = dev->resource;
+		platform_device_unregister(dev++);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'val' - possible side-effects?

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#118: FILE: drivers/soc/soc-core.c:47:
+	devices = kzalloc(nr_devs * sizeof(struct platform_device), GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#135: FILE: drivers/soc/soc-core.c:64:
+		res = kzalloc (blk->num_resources * sizeof (struct resource), GFP_KERNEL);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#154: FILE: drivers/soc/soc-core.c:83:
+				res[r].start = base + SIGNED_SHIFT(blk->res[r].start, relative_addr_shift);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#223: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:61:
+#define IORESOURCE_IRQ_SOC_SUBDEVICE    (1<<5)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
