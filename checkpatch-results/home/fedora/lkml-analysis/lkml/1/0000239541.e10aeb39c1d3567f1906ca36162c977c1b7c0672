WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#30: FILE: debug/mdb/mdb.h:1:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#32: FILE: debug/mdb/mdb.h:3:
+/***************************************************************************
+*

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: debug/mdb/mdb.h:39:
+extern int mdb_printf(char *s, ...);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <DBGPrint>
#69: FILE: debug/mdb/mdb.h:40:
+#define DBGPrint   mdb_printf

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#80: FILE: debug/mdb/mdb.h:51:
+/* internal trace messages */ $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
