Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1890:
+extern void mapping_update_time(struct file *file);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#174: FILE: mm/memory.c:1476:
+		struct address_space *mapping = page_mapping(page);
+		if (mapping)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
