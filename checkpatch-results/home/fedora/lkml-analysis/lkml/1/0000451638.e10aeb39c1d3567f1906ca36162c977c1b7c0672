CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#68: FILE: fs/pipe.c:32:
+	return (void *) page->private;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#70: FILE: fs/pipe.c:34:
+}
+#define pipe_kmap_atomic(page, type)	pipe_kmap(page)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#83: FILE: fs/pipe.c:204:
+static void *pipe_buf_map(struct pipe_inode_info *pipe,
+			   struct pipe_buffer *buf, int atomic)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#94: FILE: fs/pipe.c:215:
+static void pipe_buf_unmap(struct pipe_inode_info *pipe,
+			    struct pipe_buffer *buf, void *map_data)

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#99: FILE: fs/pipe.c:220:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
