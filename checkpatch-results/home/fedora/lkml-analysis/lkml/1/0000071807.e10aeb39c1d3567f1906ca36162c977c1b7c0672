#31: 
We mapped each IOAPIC pin to a VIRQ, so that we can deliver interrupt through

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/acpi.h> instead of <asm/acpi.h>
#98: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:58:
+#include <asm/acpi.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#109: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1063:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "Hybrid feature: Event channel enabled\n");

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u64' over 'uint64_t'
#148: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1177:
+	uint64_t callback_via;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#249: FILE: drivers/xen/events.c:951:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#263: FILE: drivers/xen/events.c:965:
+		set_irq_chip_and_handler_name(i, &xen_dynamic_chip,
+					handle_level_irq, "event");

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#273: FILE: drivers/xen/events.c:975:
+		int vector = FIRST_EXTERNAL_VECTOR + i;
+		if (vector != IA32_SYSCALL_VECTOR)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxE)
