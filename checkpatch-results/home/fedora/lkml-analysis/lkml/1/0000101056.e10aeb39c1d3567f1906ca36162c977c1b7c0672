#37: 
o AS is a single queue ioschduler, that means there is one AS queue per group.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#77: FILE: block/Kconfig.iosched:48:
+config IOSCHED_AS_HIER
+	bool "Anticipatory Hierarchical Scheduling support"
+	depends on IOSCHED_AS && CGROUPS
+	select ELV_FAIR_QUEUING
+	select GROUP_IOSCHED
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  Enable hierarhical scheduling in anticipatory. In this mode
+	  anticipatory keeps one IO queue per cgroup instead of a global
+	  queue. Elevator fair queuing logic ensures fairness among various
+	  queues.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#192: FILE: block/as-iosched.c:214:
+	if (as_batch_expired(ad, asq))
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#197: FILE: block/as-iosched.c:219:
+		BUG_ON((asq->current_batch_time_left) < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be

#258: FILE: block/as-iosched.c:280:

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
