+int hrtimer_start_pinned(struct hrtimer *timer,

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#203: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1291:
+		BUG_ON(get_hrtimer_state(timer)	!= HRTIMER_STATE_CALLBACK);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#242: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:297:
+extern int hrtimer_start_pinned(struct hrtimer *timer, ktime_t tim,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#243: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:298:
