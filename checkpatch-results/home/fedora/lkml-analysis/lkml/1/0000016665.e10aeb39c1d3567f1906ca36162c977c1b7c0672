A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'SetBWModeCallback8192SUsbWorkItem', this function's name, in a string

+			RT_TRACE(COMP_DBG, "SetBWModeCallback8192SUsbWorkItem(): unknown Bandwidth: %#X\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
