Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:61:
+extern void synchronize_sched(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead
#128: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:61:
+extern void synchronize_sched(void);

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead
#283: FILE: kernel/rcupdate.c:128:
+void synchronize_sched(void)

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'call_rcu_sched', prefer 'call_rcu' instead
#292: FILE: kernel/rcupdate.c:137:
+	call_rcu_sched(&rcu.head, wakeme_after_rcu);

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#319: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:53:
 MODULE_AUTHOR("Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@us.ibm.com> and "
+	      "Josh Triplett <josh@freedesktop.org>");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#370: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:290:
+	 * force_quiescent_state. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rp"
#399: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:646:
+		if (rp == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'preemptable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'preemptible'?
#888: FILE: kernel/rcutree_plugin.h:477:
