WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#94: FILE: mm/filemap.c:807:
+			 * is locked, the page must have a non-zero refcount */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#95: FILE: mm/filemap.c:808:
+			BUG_ON(locked);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
