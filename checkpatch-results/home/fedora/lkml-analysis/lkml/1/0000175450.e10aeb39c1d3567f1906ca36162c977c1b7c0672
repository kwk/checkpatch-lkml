CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#64: FILE: fs/seq_file.c:65:
+	m->count = m->from = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Eoverflow>
#87: FILE: fs/seq_file.c:88:
+			goto Eoverflow;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
