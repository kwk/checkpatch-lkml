#27: 
This patch avoids holding the mmap semaphore while walking VMAs in response to

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#96: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:957:
+    ^I^I^I struct vfsmount **mnt)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#104: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:965:
+	error = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
