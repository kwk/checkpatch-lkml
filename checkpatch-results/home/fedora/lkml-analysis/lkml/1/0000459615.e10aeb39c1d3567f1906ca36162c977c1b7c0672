WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#74: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/Kconfig:206:
+config KEYBOARD_PXA27x
+	tristate "PXA27x keyboard support"
+	depends on PXA27x
+	help
+	  Enable support for PXA27x matrix keyboard controller

+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#103: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/pxa27x_keyboard.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#104: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/pxa27x_keyboard.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/input/keyboard/pxa27x_keyboard.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#120: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/pxa27x_keyboard.c:18:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
