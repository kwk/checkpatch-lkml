#298: FILE: drivers/uio/uio_pci_generic.c:1:
+/* uio_pci_generic - generic UIO driver for PCI 2.3 devices

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*gdev)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct uio_pci_generic_dev)...)
#444: FILE: drivers/uio/uio_pci_generic.c:147:
+	gdev = kzalloc(sizeof(struct uio_pci_generic_dev), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
