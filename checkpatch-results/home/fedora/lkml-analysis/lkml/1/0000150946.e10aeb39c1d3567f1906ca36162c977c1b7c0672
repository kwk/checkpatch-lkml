WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinitdata is unnecessary

+static __devinitdata struct s6_spi_platform_data s6_spi_pdata = {

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __devinitdata should be placed after s6_spi_pdata
#95: FILE: arch/xtensa/platforms/s6105/device.c:201:
+static __devinitdata struct s6_spi_platform_data s6_spi_pdata = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
