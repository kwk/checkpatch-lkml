Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#84: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:1131:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!port"
#101: FILE: lib/iomap.c:274:
+	if (port == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#109: FILE: lib/iomap.c:282:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(iomap_name);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/asm-generic/iomap.h:69:
+extern char *iomap_name(void __iomem *addr, char *buf, size_t len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#121: FILE: include/asm-generic/iomap.h:72:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
