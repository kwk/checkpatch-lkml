WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#41: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/cache.c:507:
+#define INFO(s)	printk(KERN_INFO "cache: " s "\n");

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#41: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/cpu/cache.c:507:
+#define INFO(s)	printk(KERN_INFO "cache: " s "\n");

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
