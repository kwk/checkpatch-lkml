Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+	return __pgprot(preservebits | addbits);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
