Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buf"
#140: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2921:
+	if (buf == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#168: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2973:
+static struct file_operations tracing_mark_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#184: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:3099:
+		pr_warning("Could not create debugfs "
+			   "'trace_marker' entry\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
