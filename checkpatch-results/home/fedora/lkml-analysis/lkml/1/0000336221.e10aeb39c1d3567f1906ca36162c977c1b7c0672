The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct address_space *' should also have an identifier name
#117: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:485:
+	int (*write_one_page)(struct address_space *, pgoff_t, struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'pgoff_t' should also have an identifier name

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern int generic_file_buffered_write_one_page(struct address_space *,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
