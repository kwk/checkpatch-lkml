#30: 
b) for KMS drivers we provide a hook/callback to enable/disable VGA decoding.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#78: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/drm_irq.c:187:
+	if (state)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#80: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/drm_irq.c:189:
+	else {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#169: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_drv.h:753:
+extern int intel_modeset_vga_set_state(struct drm_device *dev, bool state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#181: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_reg.h:33:
+#define INTEL_GMCH_VGA_DISABLE  (1 << 1)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#236: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/r100.c:1497:
+	uint32_t temp;

CHECK:BOOL_COMPARISON: Using comparison to false is error prone
#239: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/r100.c:1500:
+	if (state == false) {

Comparisons of A to true and false are better written
as A and !A.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#240: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/r100.c:1501:
+		temp &= ~(1<<8);
 		           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#241: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/r100.c:1502:
+		temp |= (1<<9);
 		          ^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
