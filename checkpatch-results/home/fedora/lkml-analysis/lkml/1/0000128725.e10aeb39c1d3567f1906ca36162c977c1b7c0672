CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#108: FILE: include/linux/security.h:55:
+extern int cap_ptrace_access_check(struct task_struct *child, unsigned int mode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#135: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1339:
+	int (*ptrace_access_check) (struct task_struct *child, unsigned int mode);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
