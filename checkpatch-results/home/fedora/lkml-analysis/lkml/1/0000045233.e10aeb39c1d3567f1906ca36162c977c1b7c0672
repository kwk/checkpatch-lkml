Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#59: FILE: drivers/md/dm-exception-store.h:158:
+	BUG_ON(!dm_consecutive_chunk_count(e));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

+						  "support snapshot-merge";

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
