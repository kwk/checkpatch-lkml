CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#59: FILE: drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:1290:
+	return ((u64) (amd64_get_dct_base(pvt, 0, csrow) & pvt->dcsb_base)) <<

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'bits'
#74: FILE: drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:1305:
+	/* Extract bits bits 29-21 and 15-9 from DCSM (section 3.5.5). */

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#109: FILE: drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:1340:
+	for (csrow = 0; csrow < CHIPSELECT_COUNT; csrow++) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'input_addr_to_csrow', this function's name, in a string
#111: FILE: drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:1342:
+			debugf2("input_addr_to_csrow: CSBE bit is cleared "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#112: FILE: drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:1343:
+			debugf2("input_addr_to_csrow: CSBE bit is cleared "
+				"for csrow %d (node %d)\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#122: FILE: drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:1353:
+			debugf2("InputAddr 0x%lx matches csrow %d "
+				"(MC node %d)\n",

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#222: FILE: drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:1453:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
