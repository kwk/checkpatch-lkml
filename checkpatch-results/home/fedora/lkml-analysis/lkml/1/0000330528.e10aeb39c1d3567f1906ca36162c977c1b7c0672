CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "slot"
#61: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:176:
+	if (slot != NULL && slot->host->fclk_enabled && slot->fclk_freq > 0) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#105: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:224:
+	if (claimed) {
[...]
+		OMAP_MMC_WRITE(host, CON, slot->saved_con);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#110: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:229:
+		 * start after writing the CMD register. Sigh. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
