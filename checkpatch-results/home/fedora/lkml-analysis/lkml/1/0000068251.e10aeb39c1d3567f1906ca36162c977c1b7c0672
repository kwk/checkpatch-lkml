WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#153: FILE: checkpoint/memory.c:350:
+	BUG_ON(inode && vma);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?

 	^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#363: FILE: include/linux/checkpoint.h:178:
+extern int shmem_vma_checkpoint(struct ckpt_ctx *ctx,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#522: FILE: mm/shmem.c:2395:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
