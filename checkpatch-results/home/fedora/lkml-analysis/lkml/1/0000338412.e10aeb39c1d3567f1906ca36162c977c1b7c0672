WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#60: FILE: tests/Kconfig:1:
+# tests/Kconfig

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#62: FILE: tests/Kconfig:3:
+menuconfig KERNEL_TESTS
+	bool "Kernel subsystem tests"
+	help
+	  You can build kernel subsystem specific tests.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
