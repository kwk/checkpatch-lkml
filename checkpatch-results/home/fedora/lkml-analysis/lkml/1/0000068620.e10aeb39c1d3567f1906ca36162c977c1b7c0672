CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#66: FILE: arch/frv/include/asm/hardirq.h:15:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#73: FILE: arch/frv/include/asm/hardirq.h:22:
 }
+#define ack_bad_irq ack_bad_irq

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
