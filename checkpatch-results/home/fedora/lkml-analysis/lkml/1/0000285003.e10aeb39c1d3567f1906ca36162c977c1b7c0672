ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#86: FILE: fs/namei.c:525:
+			struct dentry * dentry = d_alloc(parent, name);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#87: FILE: fs/namei.c:526:
+			struct dentry * dentry = d_alloc(parent, name);
+			result = ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#89: FILE: fs/namei.c:528:
+				result = dir->i_op->lookup(dir, dentry, nd);

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#106: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1254:
+	struct dentry * (*lookup_path) (struct inode *, struct qstr *);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#106: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1254:
+	struct dentry * (*lookup_path) (struct inode *, struct qstr *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct qstr *' should also have an identifier name
#106: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1254:
+	struct dentry * (*lookup_path) (struct inode *, struct qstr *);
