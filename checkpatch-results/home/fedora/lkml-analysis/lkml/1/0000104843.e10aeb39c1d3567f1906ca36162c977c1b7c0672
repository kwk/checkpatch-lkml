WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#76: FILE: drivers/isdn/hardware/eicon/divasmain.c:133:
+	{PCI_VDEVICE(EICON, PCI_DEVICE_ID_EICON_MAESTRAP_2_VOIP), CARDTYPE_DIVASRV_VOICE_P_30M_V2_PCI},

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
