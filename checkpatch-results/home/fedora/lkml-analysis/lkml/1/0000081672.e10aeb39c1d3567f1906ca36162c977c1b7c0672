WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config KEXEC_AUTO_RESERVE
+	bool "automatically reserve memory for kexec kernel"
+	depends on KEXEC
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  Automatically reserve memory for a kexec kernel, so that you don't
+	  need to specify numbers for the "crashkernel=X@Y" boot option,
+	  instead you can use "crashkernel=auto". To make this work, you need
+	  to have more than 4G memory. On PPC, 256M is reserved, 1/32 memory
+	  on PPC64, but it will not exceed 1T/32.
+
 config CRASH_DUMP
 	bool "Build a kdump crash kernel"

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
