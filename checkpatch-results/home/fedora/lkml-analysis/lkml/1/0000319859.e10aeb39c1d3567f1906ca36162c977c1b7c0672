ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#107: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:10:
=20

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#114: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:340:
 	else {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#115: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:341:
+		if (!e820_all_mapped(0xF0000, 0xF0000+0x10000, E820_RESERVED))
 		                                     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
