CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#313: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:434:
+extern void perf_counter_do_pending(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cmpxchg"
#400: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1577:
+	if (cmpxchg(&counter->wakeup.next, NULL, PENDING_TAIL) != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#406: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1583:
+		prev = counter->wakeup.next = *head;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!counter->wakeup.next"
#457: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1634:
+	return counter->wakeup.next == NULL;
