#37: 
Below is my patch for an issue on Dell E6500 notebooks with the Sigmatel stac92hd71b7 codec. In the default snd-hda-intel configuration, the sound going to the headphone jack goes comes directly from the DAC, resulting in very low volume output. The patch changes the codec's widget connections so that the internal mixer is put in between and sets its input amplifiers to the maximum value. The output to the internal speaker port has been left untouched.
