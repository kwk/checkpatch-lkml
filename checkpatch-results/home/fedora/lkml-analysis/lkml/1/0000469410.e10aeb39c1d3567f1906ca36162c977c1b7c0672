ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0l
#56: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/setup.c:79:
+static unsigned long __initdata memory_end = 0l;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after memory_end
#56: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/setup.c:79:
+static unsigned long __initdata memory_end = 0l;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
