WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#81: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:368:
+	char c, previous_symbf[4096];
+	if (sscanf(line, "%llx %c %s", &previous_start, &c, previous_symbf) != 3)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sym"
#103: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:387:
+				if (sym == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
