- use a #define'd constant for the local buffer size in read/write functions

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/linux/cgroup.h:30:
+extern bool cgroup_lock_live_group(struct cgroup *cgrp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#116: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:1370:
+#define CGROUP_LOCAL_BUFFER_SIZE 64 $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
