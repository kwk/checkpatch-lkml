CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*css)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct channel_subsystem)...)
#161: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.c:677:
+		css = kmalloc(sizeof(struct channel_subsystem), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
