CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!process_times_percpu"
#298: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1515:
+	if (process_times_percpu == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#306: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1523:
+		return(0);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#412: FILE: kernel/compat.c:175:

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#412: FILE: kernel/compat.c:175:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#433: FILE: kernel/fork.c:858:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
