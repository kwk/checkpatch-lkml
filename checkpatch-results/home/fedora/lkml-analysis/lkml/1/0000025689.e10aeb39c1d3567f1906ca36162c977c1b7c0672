Subject: [PATCH] timers: Introduce the concept of timer slack for legacy timers

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: include/linux/timer.h:175:
+extern void set_timer_slack(struct timer_list *time, int slack_hz);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#155: FILE: kernel/timer.c:755:
+		expires_limit = expires + (expires - jiffies)/256;
 		                                             ^
