WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#65: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c:1293:
+		 * fall through and take the SDHCI_INT_RESPONSE */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#65: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c:1293:
+		 * fall through and take the SDHCI_INT_RESPONSE */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#78: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.h:214:
+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_BUSY_IRQ				(1<<15)
                                				  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#78: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.h:214:
+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_BUSY_IRQ				(1<<15)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
