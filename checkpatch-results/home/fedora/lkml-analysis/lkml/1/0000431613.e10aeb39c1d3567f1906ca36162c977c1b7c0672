ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#236: FILE: fs/open.c:574:
+static int chown_common(struct dentry * dentry, struct vfsmount *mnt,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#375: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1473:
+extern int do_truncate(struct dentry *, struct vfsmount *, loff_t start,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dentry *' should also have an identifier name
#375: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1473:
+extern int do_truncate(struct dentry *, struct vfsmount *, loff_t start,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
