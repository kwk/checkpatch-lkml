#32: 
x86 arch support for remapping HPET MSI's by associating the HPET timer block

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/hpet.h:82:
+extern int arch_setup_hpet_msi(unsigned int irq, unsigned int id);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
