move_irq_desc will try to move irq_desc to node wanted if allocated one is not correct.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'that'

+         This enables irq_desc to cpu/node that that device is connected.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#146: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:212:
+extern struct irq_desc *move_irq_desc(struct irq_desc *old_desc, int node);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
