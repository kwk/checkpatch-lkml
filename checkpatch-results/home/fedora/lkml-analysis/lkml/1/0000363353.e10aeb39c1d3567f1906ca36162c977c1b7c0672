WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Contoller' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Controller'?
#45: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-bfin-twi.c:46:
+#define DRV_DESC	"Blackfin BF5xx on-chip I2C TWI Contoller Driver"
                 	                                ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#69: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-bfin-twi.c:109:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around adap->dev
#94: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-bfin-twi.c:342:
+		dev_err(&(adap->dev), "10 bits addr not supported !\n");

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around pdev->dev
#117: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-bfin-twi.c:694:
+		dev_err(&(pdev->dev), "can't get IRQ %d !\n", iface->irq);

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around pdev->dev
#127: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-bfin-twi.c:717:
+	dev_info(&(pdev->dev), "%s, Version %s, regs_base@0x%08x\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#128: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-bfin-twi.c:718:
+	dev_info(&(pdev->dev), "%s, Version %s, regs_base@0x%08x\n",
+		DRV_DESC, DRV_VERSION, iface->regs_base);
