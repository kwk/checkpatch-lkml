WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#136: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:213:
+	unsigned sense_len	= sizeof(struct request_sense);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#176: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:238:
+	BUG_ON(!drive->rq_sense);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#182: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:243:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#225: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:902:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "%s: error prepping sense request!\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#226: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:903:
