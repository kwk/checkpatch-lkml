WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct splice_pipe_desc *' should also have an identifier name
#120: FILE: include/linux/splice.h:57:
+	void (*spd_release)(struct splice_pipe_desc *, unsigned int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pipe_buf_operations should normally be const
#241: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:99:
+static struct pipe_buf_operations sock_pipe_buf_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#577: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp.c:567:
+	ret = spliced = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#584: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp.c:574:
+		if (ret < 0)
[...]
+		else if (!ret) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
