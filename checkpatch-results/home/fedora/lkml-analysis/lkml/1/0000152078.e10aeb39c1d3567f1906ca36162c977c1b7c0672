Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#268: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:329:
+extern void perf_swcounter_event(u32, u64, int, struct pt_regs *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#373: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1537:
+		perf_swcounter_ctx_event(cpuctx->task_ctx, type, event,
+				nr, nmi, regs);

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#457: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1881:
+	else switch (hw_event->type) {

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
