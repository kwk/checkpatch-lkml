WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#143: FILE: include/linux/trigger.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_TRIGGER_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>

WARNING:NEW_TYPEDEFS: do not add new typedefs

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#405: FILE: kernel/stop_machine.c:89:
+			 * multiple CPUs. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
