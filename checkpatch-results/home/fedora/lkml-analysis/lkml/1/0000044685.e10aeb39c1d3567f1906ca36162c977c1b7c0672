WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'choise' may be misspelled - perhaps 'choice'?
#55: 
Ah. I think the first choice is always the best choise. =)

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#492: FILE: block/blk-core.c:2268:
+	struct bio_vec* bvec;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#558: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:404:
+extern void bio_flush_dcache_pages(struct bio *bi);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
