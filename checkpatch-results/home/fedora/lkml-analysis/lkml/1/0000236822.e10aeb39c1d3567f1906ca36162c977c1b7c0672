#33: 
The removal of the CPU from the various maps was redundant as it already happened in cpu_disable.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#111: FILE: include/asm-x86/smp.h:219:
+extern void reset_lazy_tlbstate(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
