CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#89: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-annotate.c:31:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#114: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-annotate.c:1055:
+	if (percent >= MIN_RED)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "p"
#166: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-annotate.c:1162:
+	while (*p != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
