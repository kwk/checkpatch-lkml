CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#160: FILE: drivers/net/atlx/atl1.c:1800:
+		if (adapter->vlgrp && (rrd->pkt_flg & PACKET_FLAG_VLAN_INS)) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'work_done < budget'
#220: FILE: drivers/net/atlx/atl1.c:1888:
+	if ((work_done < budget) || !netif_running(poll_dev)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#292: FILE: drivers/net/atlx/atl1.c:2328:
+		struct rx_return_desc *rrd;
+		rrd = ATL1_RRD_DESC(rrd_ring,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#293: FILE: drivers/net/atlx/atl1.c:2329:
+		rrd = ATL1_RRD_DESC(rrd_ring,
+			((u16) atomic_read(&rrd_ring->next_to_clean)));

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#293: FILE: drivers/net/atlx/atl1.c:2329:
+			((u16) atomic_read(&rrd_ring->next_to_clean)));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxE)

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#440: FILE: drivers/net/atlx/atlx.h:37:
+#define ATLX_DRIVER_VERSION "2.1.1"DRIVERNAPI

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");
