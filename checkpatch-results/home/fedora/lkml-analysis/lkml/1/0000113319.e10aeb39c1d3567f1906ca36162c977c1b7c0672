#32: 
controller has a companion OHCI controller to manage USB full and low speed.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+ * -------------------------------------------------------------------- */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#129: FILE: arch/arm/mach-at91/include/mach/board.h:95:
+extern void __init at91_add_device_usbh_ehci(struct at91_usbh_data *data);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
