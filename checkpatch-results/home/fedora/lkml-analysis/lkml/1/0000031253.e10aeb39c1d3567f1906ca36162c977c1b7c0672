#45: 
This fixes a receive problem of the ks8851 snl network driver.  Under heavy TCP traffic the device will stop operating correctly.  First the receive interrupt is not triggered anymore.  After then the driver cannot retrieve the correct packets from the device.  A workaround for this problem is to disable the transmit done interrupt.
