WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#45: 
# perf probe test

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#87: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-probe.c:123:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
