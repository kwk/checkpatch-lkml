WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#137: FILE: drivers/regulator/virtual.c:164:
+	if (strict_strtol(buf, 10, &val) != 0)

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:EXPORTED_WORLD_WRITABLE: Exporting world writable files is usually an error. Consider more restrictive permissions.
#177: FILE: drivers/regulator/virtual.c:255:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(min_microamps, 0666, show_min_uA, set_min_uA);

Exporting world writable sysfs/debugfs files is usually a bad thing.
When done arbitrarily they can introduce serious security bugs.
In the past, some of the debugfs vulnerabilities would seemingly allow
any local user to write arbitrary values into device registers - a
situation from which little good can be expected to emerge.

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_PERMS: DEVICE_ATTR unusual permissions '0666' used
#177: FILE: drivers/regulator/virtual.c:255:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(min_microamps, 0666, show_min_uA, set_min_uA);

The permissions used in DEVICE_ATTR are unusual.
Typically only three permissions are used - 0644 (RW), 0444 (RO)
and 0200 (WO).
