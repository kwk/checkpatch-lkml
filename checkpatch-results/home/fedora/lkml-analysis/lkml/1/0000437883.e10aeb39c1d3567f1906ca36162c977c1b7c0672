#68: 
 and verified that my user app is woken up in sync with the polling interval.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#339: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/mce.h:108:
+extern int mce_notify_user(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#359: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/thread_info.h:137:
+#define _TIF_MCE_NOTIFY		(1<<TIF_MCE_NOTIFY)
                        		  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#359: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/thread_info.h:137:
+#define _TIF_MCE_NOTIFY		(1<<TIF_MCE_NOTIFY)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
