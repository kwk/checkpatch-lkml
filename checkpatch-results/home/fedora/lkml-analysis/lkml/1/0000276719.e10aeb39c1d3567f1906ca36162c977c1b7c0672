WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#58: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/mmc_spi.c:1140:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct device *' should also have an identifier name
#102: FILE: include/linux/spi/mmc_spi.h:30:
+	int (*get_cd)(struct device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
