WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pci_save_pcie_state', this function's name, in a string
#134: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:571:
+		dev_err(&dev->dev, "out of memory in pci_save_pcie_state\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
