CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dev_id)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pnp_id)...)
#75: FILE: drivers/pnp/card.c:108:
+	dev_id = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pnp_id), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
