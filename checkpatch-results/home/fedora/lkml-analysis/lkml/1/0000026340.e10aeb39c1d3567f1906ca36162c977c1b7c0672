WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct wacom_features should normally be const
#50: FILE: drivers/input/tablet/wacom_sys.c:535:
+	struct wacom_features *features = (void *)id->driver_info;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
