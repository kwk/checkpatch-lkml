The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#60: FILE: drivers/net/usb/hso.c:381:
+	dbg_dump(__LINE__, __func__, (unsigned char*)buf_, len_)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
