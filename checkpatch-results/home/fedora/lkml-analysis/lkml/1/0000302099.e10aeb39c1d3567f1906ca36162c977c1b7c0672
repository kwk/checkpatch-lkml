CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#220: FILE: security/keys/internal.h:162:
+extern long keyctl_get_security(key_serial_t, char __user *, size_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'key_serial_t' should also have an identifier name
#220: FILE: security/keys/internal.h:162:
+extern long keyctl_get_security(key_serial_t, char __user *, size_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char __user *' should also have an identifier name
#220: FILE: security/keys/internal.h:162:
+extern long keyctl_get_security(key_serial_t, char __user *, size_t);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#263: FILE: security/keys/keyctl.c:1114:
+		 * have the authorisation token handy */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
