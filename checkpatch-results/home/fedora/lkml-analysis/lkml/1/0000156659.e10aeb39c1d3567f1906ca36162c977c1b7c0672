CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#225: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:1214:
+extern irqreturn_t pci_sriov_migration(struct pci_dev *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#233: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:1223:
 }
+static inline irqreturn_t pci_sriov_migration(struct pci_dev *dev)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
