ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#78: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:23:
+unsigned int pci_no_iospace = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
