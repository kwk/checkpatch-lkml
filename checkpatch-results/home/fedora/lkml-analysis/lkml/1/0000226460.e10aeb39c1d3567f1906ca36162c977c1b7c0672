ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#59: 
--- a/drivers/dma/dmatest.c~a

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*dtc)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct dmatest_chan)...)
#66: FILE: drivers/dma/dmatest.c:333:
+	dtc = kmalloc(sizeof(struct dmatest_chan), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
