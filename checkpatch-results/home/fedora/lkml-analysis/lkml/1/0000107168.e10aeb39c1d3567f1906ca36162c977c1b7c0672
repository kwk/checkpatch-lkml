+	depends on THERMAL && THERMAL_HWMON && ACPI
+	---help---
+	  This is a driver for Acer Aspire One netbooks. It allows to access
+	  the temperature sensor and to control the fan.
+
+	  After loading this driver the BIOS is still in control of the fan.
+	  To let the kernel handle the fan, do:
+	  echo -n enabled > /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/mode
+
+	  For more information about this driver see
+	  <http://piie.net/files/acerhdf_README.txt>
+
+	  If you have an Acer Aspire One netbook, say Y or M
+	  here.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph

FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
