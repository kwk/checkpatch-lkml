WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#68: FILE: include/linux/ncp_fs.h:207:
+extern struct dentry_operations ncp_root_dentry_operations;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode*' should also have an identifier name
#79: FILE: include/linux/ncp_fs.h:230:
+int ncp_symlink(struct inode*, struct dentry*, const char*);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
