WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#78: FILE: kernel/exit.c:1112:
+	struct pid *pid = NULL;
+	if (type == PIDTYPE_PID)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'type < PIDTYPE_MAX'
#132: FILE: kernel/exit.c:1481:
+	if ((type < PIDTYPE_MAX) && (!pid || hlist_empty(&pid->tasks[type])))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#218: FILE: kernel/exit.c:1650:
+	if (upid == -1)
[...]
+	else if (upid < 0) {
[...]
+	else if (upid == 0) {
[...]
+	else /* upid > 0 */ {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
