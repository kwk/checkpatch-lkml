#48: 
The code has been extraced from Ingo's exec-shield patch

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#72: FILE: arch/ia64/ia32/binfmt_elf32.c:229:
+elf32_map (struct file *filep, unsigned long addr, struct elf_phdr *eppnt, int prot, int type, unsigned long unused)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#118: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:314:
+	/*
+	* total_size is the size of the ELF (interpreter) image.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#125: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:321:
+	if (total_size) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
