Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#73: FILE: include/linux/prio_heap.h:64:
+extern void *heap_delete_max(struct ptr_heap *heap);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#94: FILE: lib/prio_heap.c:36:
+		int largest = pos;
+		if (left < heap->size && heap->gt(ptrs[left], p))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
