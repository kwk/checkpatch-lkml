#28: 
After ext3 orphan list check has been added into ext3_destroy_inode() (please see my previous patch) the following situation has been detected:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#56: 
As far as i see is_bad_inode() is called after iget() in all places excluding ext3_lookup() and ext3_get_parent(). I believe it makes sense to add bad inode check to these functions too and call iput if bad inode detected.
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ^^^^
