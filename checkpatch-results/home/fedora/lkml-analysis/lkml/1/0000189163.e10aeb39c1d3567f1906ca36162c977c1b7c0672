WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#92: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#140: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:49:
+static int __devinit probe_maple_mouse(struct device *dev)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*mse)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dc_mouse)...)
#151: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:60:
+	mse = kzalloc(sizeof(struct dc_mouse), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#181: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:90:

 	                                                  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#182: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:91:

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#193: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/maplemouse.c:102:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
