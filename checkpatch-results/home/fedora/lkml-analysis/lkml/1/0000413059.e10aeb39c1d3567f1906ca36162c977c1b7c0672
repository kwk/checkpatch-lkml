WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#77: FILE: evaluate.c:2620:
+		int offset = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#199: FILE: expression.c:172:

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
