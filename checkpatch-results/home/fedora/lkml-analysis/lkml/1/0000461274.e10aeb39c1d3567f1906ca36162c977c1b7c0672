WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'durring' may be misspelled - perhaps 'during'?
#68: 
where durring module_init, the only clocksource available is the low-res
      ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
