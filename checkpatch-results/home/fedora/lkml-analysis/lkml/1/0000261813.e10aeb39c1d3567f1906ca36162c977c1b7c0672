The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pnp_assign_resources', this function's name, in a string
#677: FILE: drivers/pnp/manager.c:241:
+	dev_dbg(&dev->dev, "pnp_assign_resources, try dependent set %d\n", set);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (16, 32)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#785: FILE: drivers/pnp/manager.c:272:
+	if (ret < 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
