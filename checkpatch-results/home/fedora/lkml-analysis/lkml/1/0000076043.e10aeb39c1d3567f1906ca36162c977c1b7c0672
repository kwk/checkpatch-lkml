                                             ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#285: FILE: drivers/base/power/main.c:521:
+static void dbg_show_time(struct timeval *start, struct device *dev,
+			  pm_message_t state, char *info) {}

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
