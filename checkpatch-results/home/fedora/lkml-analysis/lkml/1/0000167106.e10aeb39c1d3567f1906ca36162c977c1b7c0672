Subject: [PATCH 36/43] drivers/net/wan: fix sparse warning: symbol shadows an

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#64: FILE: drivers/net/wan/sbni.c:1529:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dev"
#64: FILE: drivers/net/wan/sbni.c:1529:
+		if (dev != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
