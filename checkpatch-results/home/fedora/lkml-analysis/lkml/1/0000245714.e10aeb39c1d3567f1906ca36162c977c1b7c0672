#31: 
There's been a patch floating around for toshiba_acpi that exports an ad-hoc

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#136: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:235:
+static acpi_status hci_write2(u32 reg, u32 in1, u32 in2, u32* result)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
