Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#141: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1480:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
