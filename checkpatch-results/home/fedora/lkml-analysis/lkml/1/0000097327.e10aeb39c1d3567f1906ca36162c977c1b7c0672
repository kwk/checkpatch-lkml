Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#184: FILE: kernel/params.c:120:
+				for (mover = iterator; *mover; mover++) {
+					*mover = *(mover + 1);
+				}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#195: FILE: kernel/params.c:131:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
