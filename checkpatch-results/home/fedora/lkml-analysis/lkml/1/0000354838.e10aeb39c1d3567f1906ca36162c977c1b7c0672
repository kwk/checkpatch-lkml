WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'xfs_imap_to_bp', this function's name, in a string
#70: FILE: fs/xfs/xfs_inode.c:194:
+				"xfs_imap_to_bp: xfs_trans_read_buf()returned "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
