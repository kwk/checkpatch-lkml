WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#58: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#131: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/w1-gpio.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/gpio.h> instead of <asm/gpio.h>
#149: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/w1-gpio.c:19:
+#include <asm/gpio.h>

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*master)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct w1_bus_master)...)
#184: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/w1-gpio.c:54:
+	master = kzalloc(sizeof(struct w1_bus_master), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
