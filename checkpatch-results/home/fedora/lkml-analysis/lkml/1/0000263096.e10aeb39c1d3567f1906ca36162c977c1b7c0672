WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#285: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup.c:215:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#293: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup.c:223:
+static char __initdata command_line[COMMAND_LINE_SIZE];

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#326: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup.c:256:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
