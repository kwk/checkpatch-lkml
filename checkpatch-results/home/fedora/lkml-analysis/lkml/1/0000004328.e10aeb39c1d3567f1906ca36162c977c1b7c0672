Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "valid_irq_2_iommu"
#459: FILE: drivers/pci/intr_remapping.c:110:
+	return valid_irq_2_iommu(desc) != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#647: FILE: include/linux/dmar.h:126:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
