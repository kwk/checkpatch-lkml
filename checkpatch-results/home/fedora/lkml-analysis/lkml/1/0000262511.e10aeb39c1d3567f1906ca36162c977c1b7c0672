#36: 
With the following shell snippet one can print the memory map in the same form

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#91: FILE: drivers/firmware/Kconfig:29:
+config FIRMWARE_MEMMAP
+    bool "Add firmware-provided memory map to sysfs" if EMBEDDED
+    default (X86_64 || X86_32)
+    help
+      Add the firmware-provided (unmodified) memory map to /sys/firmware/memmap.
+      That memory map is used for example by kexec to set up parameter area
+      for the next kernel, but can also be used for debugging purposes.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#112: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#117: FILE: drivers/firmware/memmap.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#118: FILE: drivers/firmware/memmap.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/firmware/memmap.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#163: FILE: drivers/firmware/memmap.c:47:
+	BUG_ON(start > end);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*entry)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct firmware_map_entry)...)
#180: FILE: drivers/firmware/memmap.c:64:
+	entry = kmalloc(sizeof(struct firmware_map_entry), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#251: FILE: drivers/firmware/memmap.c:135:
+static struct sysfs_ops memmap_attr_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#274: FILE: drivers/firmware/memmap.c:158:
+		kobject_init_and_add(&entry->kobj, &memmap_ktype,
+			NULL, "%d", i++);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
