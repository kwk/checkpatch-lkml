CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <GPIO_32_768kHz>

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <TUCR_3_6864MHz>
#154: FILE: arch/arm/mach-sa1100/clock.c:26:
+		TUCR = TUCR_3_6864MHz;

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct clk_ops should normally be const
#173: FILE: arch/arm/mach-sa1100/clock.c:41:
+static struct clk_ops clk_gpio27_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
