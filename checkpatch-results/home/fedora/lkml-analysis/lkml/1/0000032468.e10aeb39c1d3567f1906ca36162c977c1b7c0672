WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#86: FILE: mm/mm_accessor.c:1:
+#include <linux/sched.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#101: FILE: mm/mm_accessor.c:15:
+	int ret = down_read_trylock(&mm->mmap_sem);
+	if (ret && current->mm == mm && current->mm_version != mm->version)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'chekcing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'checking'?

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'current->mm == mm'
#152: FILE: mm/mm_accessor.c:100:
+	if ((current->mm == mm) && (current->mm_version != mm->version))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
