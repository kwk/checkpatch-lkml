Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

#82: FILE: include/linux/device.h:282:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
