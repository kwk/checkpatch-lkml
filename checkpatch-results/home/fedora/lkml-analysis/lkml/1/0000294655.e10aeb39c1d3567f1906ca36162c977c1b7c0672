WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#86: FILE: kernel/stop_machine.c:31:
+	int (*fn)(void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#156: FILE: kernel/stop_machine.c:200:
+	if (cpu == NR_CPUS || cpu == ALL_CPUS)
