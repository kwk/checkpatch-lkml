This patch series is version 3. But still (and always) comments are welcome.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#51: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#56: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-bench.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#86: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-bench.c:31:
+	int (*fn)(int, const char **, const char *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const char **' should also have an identifier name
#86: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-bench.c:31:
+	int (*fn)(int, const char **, const char *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const char *' should also have an identifier name
#86: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-bench.c:31:

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
