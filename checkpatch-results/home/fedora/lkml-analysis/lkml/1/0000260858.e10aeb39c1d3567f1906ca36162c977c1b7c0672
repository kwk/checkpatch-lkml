WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'implmented' may be misspelled - perhaps 'implemented'?
#35: 
see changes / new checks implmented.
                         ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#215: FILE: scripts/Makefile.headersinst:82:
+hdr-inst := -rR -f $(srctree)/scripts/Makefile.headersinst obj

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#241: 
deleted file mode 100755

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 2
