CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#101: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h:111:
+#define _TIF_USER_RETURN_NOTIFY	(1 << TIF_USER_RETURN_NOTIFY)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

+#define _TIF_WORK_CTXSW_PREV (_TIF_WORK_CTXSW|_TIF_USER_RETURN_NOTIFY)

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#169: FILE: include/linux/user-return-notifier.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.
