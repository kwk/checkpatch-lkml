WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'lenght' may be misspelled - perhaps 'length'?

This reduces the lenght of find_busiest_group() considerably.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Non-standard signature: 'Aked-by:' - perhaps 'Acked-by:'?
#58: 
Aked-by: Peter Zijlstra <a.p.zijlstra@chello.nl>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#109: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3269:
+	sum_avg_load_per_task = avg_load_per_task = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#176: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3336:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
