The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited before semicolon

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.
