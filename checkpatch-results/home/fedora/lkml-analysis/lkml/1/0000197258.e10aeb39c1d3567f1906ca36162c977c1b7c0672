#74: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-s3c.c:1:
+/* linux/drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-s3c.c

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#74: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-s3c.c:1:
+/* linux/drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-s3c.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sdhci_ops should normally be const
#147: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-s3c.c:74:
+static struct sdhci_ops sdhci_s3c_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!name"
#205: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-s3c.c:132:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#256: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-s3c.c:183:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
