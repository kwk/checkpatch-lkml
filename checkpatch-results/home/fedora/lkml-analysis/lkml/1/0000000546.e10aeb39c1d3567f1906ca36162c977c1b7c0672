WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'skel_ao_winsn', this function's name, in a string
#96: FILE: drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/skel.c:536:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "skel_ao_winsn\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
