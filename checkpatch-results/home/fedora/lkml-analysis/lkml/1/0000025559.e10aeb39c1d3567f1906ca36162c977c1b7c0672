The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#628: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/pme/pcie_pme_acpi.c:34:

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

#668: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/pme/pcie_pme.h:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
