#43: 
broke a few setups with cards which don't quite adhere to the MMC spec - 400kHz is just too fast for them.  In my testing, all of the cards which fail at 400kHz are OK by about 350Khz but this patch drops the floor to 300 to be on the safe side.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#64: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:894:
+	if (host->f_min > 300000) {
[...]
 	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
