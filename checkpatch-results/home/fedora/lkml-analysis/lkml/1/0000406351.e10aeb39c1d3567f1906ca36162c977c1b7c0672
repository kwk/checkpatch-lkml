WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#44: 
      KVM: Assume that writes smaller than 4 bytes are to non-pagetable pages

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#297: FILE: include/linux/notifier.h:200:
+^I^I^I^I        * not handling interrupts, soon dead */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#297: FILE: include/linux/notifier.h:200:
+				        * not handling interrupts, soon dead */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
