CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#222: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device_pgid.c:318:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#233: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device_pgid.c:324:
+	CIO_MSG_EVENT(2, "snid: device 0.%x.%04x: rc=%d pvm=%02x vpm=%02x "
+		      "mism=%d rsvd=%d reset=%d\n", id->ssid, id->devno, rc,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
