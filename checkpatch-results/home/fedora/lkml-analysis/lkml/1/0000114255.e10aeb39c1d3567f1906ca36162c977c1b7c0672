Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#142: FILE: kernel/power/main.c:237:
+	int error = pm_start_workqueue();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#237: FILE: drivers/base/power/runtime.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#238: FILE: drivers/base/power/runtime.c:2:
+ * drivers/base/power/runtime.c - Helper functions for device run-time PM

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

+extern void pm_runtime_init(struct device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
