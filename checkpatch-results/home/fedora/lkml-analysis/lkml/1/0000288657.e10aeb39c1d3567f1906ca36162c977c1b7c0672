WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#51: FILE: drivers/watchdog/booke_wdt.c:2:
+ * drivers/watchdog/booke_wdt.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#79: FILE: drivers/watchdog/booke_wdt.c:55:
