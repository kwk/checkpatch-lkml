CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#36: FILE: arch/m68knommu/platform/5249/config.c:17:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#54: FILE: arch/m68knommu/platform/5249/config.c:48:
+^I^I.mapbase ^I= MCF_MBAR + MCFUART_BASE2,$

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#93: FILE: arch/m68knommu/platform/5249/config.c:87:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
