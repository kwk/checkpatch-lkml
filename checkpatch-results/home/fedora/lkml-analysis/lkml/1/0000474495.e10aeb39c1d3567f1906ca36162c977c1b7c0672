CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:231:
+extern void init_rcu_boost_late(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:232:
+extern void __rcu_preempt_boost(void);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#287: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:111:
+};
+#define RCU_BOOST_ELEMENTS 4

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#291: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:115:
+static struct task_struct *rcu_boost_task = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#348: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:172:
+	static time_t lastprint = 0;

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '+=' should be on the previous line
#384: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:208:
+					sum.rbs_stats[event][state]
+					    += per_cpu(rcu_boost_dat,

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

#489: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:313:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#557: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:381:
+	while (!list_empty(&list)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
