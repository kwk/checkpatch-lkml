#30: 
### Comments for Changeset

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'fh_verify', this function's name, in a string
#96: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c:268:
+		dprintk("fh_verify: %s/%s permission failure, "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#97: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c:269:
+		dprintk("fh_verify: %s/%s permission failure, "
+			"acc=%x, error=%d\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
