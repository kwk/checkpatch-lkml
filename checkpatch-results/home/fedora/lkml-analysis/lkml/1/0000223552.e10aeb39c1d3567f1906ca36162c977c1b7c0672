Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#104: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:211:
+extern int pci_iov_bus_range(struct pci_bus *bus);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#112: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:235:
 }
+extern inline int pci_iov_bus_range(struct pci_bus *bus)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
