CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#64: FILE: linux-2.6.25-rc9/drivers/block/cciss.c:1399:
 	if (drv_index) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
