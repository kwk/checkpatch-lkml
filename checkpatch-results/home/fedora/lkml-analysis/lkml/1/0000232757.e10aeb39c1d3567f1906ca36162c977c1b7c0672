WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#84: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:448:
+config INTEL_NOPS
+	bool "Use legacy x86 NOPS"
+	depends on X86_32
+	help
+	This option tells kernel to use legacy x86 nops

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#102: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:61:
+static int intel_legacy_nops = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
