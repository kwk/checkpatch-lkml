Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#104: FILE: drivers/staging/panel/panel.c:899:
+	int pos;
+	lcd_addr_x = lcd_addr_y = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#104: FILE: drivers/staging/panel/panel.c:899:
+	lcd_addr_x = lcd_addr_y = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
