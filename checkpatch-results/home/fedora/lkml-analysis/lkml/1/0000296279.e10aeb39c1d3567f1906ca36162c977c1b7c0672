+SW_RFKILL_ALL	T60 and later hardare rfkill rocker switch
              	              ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#91: FILE: include/linux/input.h:641:
+#define SW_RFKILL_ALL		0x03  /* rfkill master switch, type "any"
+					 set = radio enabled */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
