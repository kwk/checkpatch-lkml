ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#112: 
--- a/linux/drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-core.c	Mon Apr 23 07:41:13 2007 +0200

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#118: FILE: linux/drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-core.c:77:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#131: FILE: linux/drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-core.c:144:
+		saa7146_write(dev, BASE_EVEN3, dma_base + budget->buffer_height * budget->buffer_width);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

#165: FILE: linux/drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-core.c:516:

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#182: FILE: linux/drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-core.c:537:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
