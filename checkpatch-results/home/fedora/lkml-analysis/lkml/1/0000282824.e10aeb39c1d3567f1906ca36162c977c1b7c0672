WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#73: FILE: fs/fuse/dir.c:228:
+struct dentry_operations fuse_dentry_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#116: FILE: fs/fuse/inode.c:552:
+struct fuse_inode_handle

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
