CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#42: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_drv.h:138:
+extern int intelfb_panic(struct notifier_block *n, unsigned long ununsed,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
