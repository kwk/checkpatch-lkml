#36: 
for querying the firmware for misc hardware information, fetching the device

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#64: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:664:
+config OPEN_FIRMWARE
+	bool "Support for Open Firmware"
+	default y if OLPC
+	---help---
+	  This option adds support for the implementation of Open Firmware
+	  that is used on the OLPC XO laptop.
+	  If unsure, say N here.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#126: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#131: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/ofw.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int *' should also have an identifier name
#160: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/ofw.c:30:
+int (*call_firmware)(int *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#167: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/ofw.c:37:
+	int argarray[MAXARGS+3];
 	                    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#179: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/ofw.c:49:
+	argarray[0] = (int) name;

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#221: FILE: include/asm-x86/ofw.h:10:
+extern int ofw(const char *name, int nr_args, int nr_results, ...);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
