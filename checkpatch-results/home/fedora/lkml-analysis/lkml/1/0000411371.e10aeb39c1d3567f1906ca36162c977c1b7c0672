To use a NFS-root for UDP jumbo frames the kernel on the client need to bring

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#74: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:116:
+unsigned int ic_mtu __initdata = 0;		/* IPconfig MTU parameter: 0 - defaults, other - override */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#74: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:116:
+unsigned int ic_mtu __initdata = 0;		/* IPconfig MTU parameter: 0 - defaults, other - override */

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#83: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:214:
+			if (ic_mtu > 0)
+			{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#85: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:216:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "IP-Config: Overriding %s MTU to %d bytes\n", dev->name, ic_mtu);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#99: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:1520:
+	ic_mtu = simple_strtoul(str, &str, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
