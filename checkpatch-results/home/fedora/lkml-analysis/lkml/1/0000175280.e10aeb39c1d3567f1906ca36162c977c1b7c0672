CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/uv/uv_bau.h:328:
+extern const struct cpumask *uv_flush_tlb_others(const struct cpumask *cpumask,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#187: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tlb_uv.c:317:
+	WARN_ON(!in_atomic());

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.
