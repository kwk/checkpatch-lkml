WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#71: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:500:
+	struct dev_pm_ops *pm = dev->driver ? dev->driver->pm : NULL;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
