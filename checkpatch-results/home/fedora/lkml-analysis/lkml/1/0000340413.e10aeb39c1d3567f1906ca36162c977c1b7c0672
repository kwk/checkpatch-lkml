WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#65: FILE: fs/udf/balloc.c:192:
+		/*
+		* Check to see if we are freeing blocks across a group boundary.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#90: FILE: fs/udf/balloc.c:207:
+				udf_debug("byte=%2x\n",
+					((char *)bh->b_data)[(bit + i) >> 3]);

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <spaceBitmapDesc>
#133: FILE: fs/udf/balloc.c:251:
+			(sizeof(struct spaceBitmapDesc) << 3) +

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#161: FILE: fs/udf/balloc.c:265:
+			if (!udf_test_bit(bit, bh->b_data))
[...]
+			else if (DQUOT_PREALLOC_BLOCK(inode, 1))
[...]
+			else if (!udf_clear_bit(bit, bh->b_data)) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
