CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#175: FILE: mm/memory.c:622:
+	rss[2] = rss[1] = rss[0] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#277: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:101:
+			points += cpoint/2 + 1;
 			                ^
