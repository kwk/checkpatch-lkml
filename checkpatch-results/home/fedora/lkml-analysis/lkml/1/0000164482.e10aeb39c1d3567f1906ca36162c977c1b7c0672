grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
