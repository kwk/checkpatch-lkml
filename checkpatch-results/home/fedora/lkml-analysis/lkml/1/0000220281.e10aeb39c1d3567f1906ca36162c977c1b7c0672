WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#92: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/signal_64.c:69:
+		printk("save_i387: bad fpstate %p\n", buf);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'save_i387', this function's name, in a string
#92: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/signal_64.c:69:
+		printk("save_i387: bad fpstate %p\n", buf);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
