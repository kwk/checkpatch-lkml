WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'mechnism' may be misspelled - perhaps 'mechanism'?
#29: 
homegrown mechnism.
          ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dma_map_ops should normally be const
#61: FILE: arch/sparc/include/asm/dma-mapping.h:17:
+extern struct dma_map_ops *dma_ops, pci32_dma_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#505: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#532: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/iommu.c:843:
+extern int pci64_dma_supported(struct pci_dev *pdev, u64 device_mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#584: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/ioport.c:320:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'sbus_free_consistent', this function's name, in a string
#584: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/ioport.c:320:
+		printk("sbus_free_consistent: region 0x%lx asked 0x%zx\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#633: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/ioport.c:385:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
