#22: 
Linus, a recent merge has broken the build for KVM on ia64.  Please pull from

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/elf.h> instead of <asm/elf.h>
#44: FILE: arch/ia64/kvm/kvm-ia64.c:41:
+#include <asm/elf.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
