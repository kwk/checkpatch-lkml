WARNING:UNKNOWN_COMMIT_ID: Unknown commit id '654d1f8a019dfa06d', maybe rebased or not pulled?
#42: 
commit 654d1f8a019dfa06d (packet: less dev_put() calls)

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#46: 
Fix this by releasing lock before the sock_wmalloc()/memcpy_fromiovec() calls.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!skb"
#117: FILE: net/packet/af_packet.c:466:
+		if (skb == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#141: FILE: net/packet/af_packet.c:488:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
