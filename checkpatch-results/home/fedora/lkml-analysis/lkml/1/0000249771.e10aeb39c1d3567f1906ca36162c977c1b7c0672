WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#849: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#854: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_ipcomp.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#1003: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_ipcomp.c:150:
+	if (err) {
+		goto out_ok;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited before that close parenthesis ')'
#1011: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_ipcomp.c:158:
+	ipch->cpi = htons((u16 )ntohl(x->id.spi));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#1053: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_ipcomp.c:200:
+		void *scratch = vmalloc(IPCOMP_SCRATCH_SIZE);
+		if (!scratch)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#1084: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_ipcomp.c:231:
+		struct crypto_comp *tfm = *per_cpu_ptr(tfms, cpu);
+		crypto_free_comp(tfm);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#1118: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_ipcomp.c:265:
+	pos->tfms = tfms = alloc_percpu(struct crypto_comp *);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#1147: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_ipcomp.c:294:
+	struct ipcomp_data *ipcd = x->data;
+	if (!ipcd)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#1185: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_ipcomp.c:332:
+	BUG_ON(!calg_desc);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
