#32: 
Identify breakpoints in .kprobes.text section. These certainly aren't kprobe traps. However, we make an exception for the breakpoint hardcoded into jprobe_return.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#54: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kprobes.c:972:
+		if (in_kprobes_functions(addr) &&
[...]
+		} else if (kprobe_handler(args->regs))
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#58: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kprobes.c:976:
+			 * due to an external debugger. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
