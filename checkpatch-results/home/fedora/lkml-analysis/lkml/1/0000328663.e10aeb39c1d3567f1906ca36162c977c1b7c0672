CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

 		             ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#130: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c:371:
+				if (regs[j] & (1 << 31)) regs[j] = 0;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SCx200_GPIO_SIZE>
#156: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/scx200_32.c:68:
+		if (!request_region(base, SCx200_GPIO_SIZE, "NatSemi SCx200 GPIO")) {

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#207: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pgtable_32.c:391:
+	/* This is called just after the pmd has been detached from
+	   the pgd, which requires a full tlb flush to be recognized

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#251: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgalloc_32.h:55:
+extern void __pte_free_tlb(struct mmu_gather *tlb, struct page *pte);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
