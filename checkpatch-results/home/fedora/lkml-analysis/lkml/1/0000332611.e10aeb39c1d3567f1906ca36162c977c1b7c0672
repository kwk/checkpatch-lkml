#38: 
> Both the error handler for md RAID1 and write access request to the md RAID1

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix '.' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#98: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:605:
+	if (conf->pending_bio_list.head) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#100: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:607:
+		struct bio *bio;
+		bio = bio_list_get(&conf->pending_bio_list);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#104: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:611:
+		 * disk before proceeding w/ I/O */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
