Using weak declarations like __attribute__((weak)) or __weak
can have unintended link defects.  Avoid using them.

#49: FILE: include/linux/swiotlb.h:30:
+extern unsigned long __weak swiotlb_virt_to_bus(volatile void *address);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
