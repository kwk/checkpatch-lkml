WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 141 exceeds 100 columns
#71: FILE: include/asm-arm/arch-at91/board.h:76:
+#if defined(CONFIG_ARCH_AT91SAM9260) || defined(CONFIG_ARCH_AT91SAM9263) || defined(CONFIG_ARCH_AT91CAP9) || defined(CONFIG_ARCH_AT572D940HF)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
