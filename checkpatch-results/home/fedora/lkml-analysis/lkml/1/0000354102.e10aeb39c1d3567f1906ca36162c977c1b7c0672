CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#53: FILE: net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c:609:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#55: FILE: net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c:611:
+		struct hlist_head *hash;
+		hash = (struct hlist_head *)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
