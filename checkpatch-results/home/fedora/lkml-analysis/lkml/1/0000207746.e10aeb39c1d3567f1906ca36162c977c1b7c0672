WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#103: 
new file mode 100644

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 2
#109: FILE: scripts/markup_oops.pl:2:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#143: FILE: scripts/markup_oops.pl:36:
+  print "    dmesg | perl scripts/markup_oops.pl vmlinux\n";

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
