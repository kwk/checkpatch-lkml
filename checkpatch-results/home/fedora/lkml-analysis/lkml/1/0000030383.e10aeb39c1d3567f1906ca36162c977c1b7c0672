CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: arch/ia64/ia32/elfcore32.h:164:
+extern size_t elf_core_extra_data_size(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#81: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/elfcore.c:69:
+		(const struct elf_phdr *) (GATE_ADDR + GATE_EHDR->e_phoff);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "vma"
#147: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1886:
+	for (vma = first_vma(current, gate_vma); vma != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Elf_Half>
#161: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1912:
+	Elf_Half e_phnum;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#175: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1947:
+	 * include/linux/elf.h for further information. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
