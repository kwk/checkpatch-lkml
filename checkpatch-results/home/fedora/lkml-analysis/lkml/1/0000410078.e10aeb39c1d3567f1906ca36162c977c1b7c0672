CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*dev->ibdev.iwcm)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct iw_cm_verbs)...)
#66: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb3/iwch_provider.c:1166:
+	dev->ibdev.iwcm = kmalloc(sizeof(struct iw_cm_verbs), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
