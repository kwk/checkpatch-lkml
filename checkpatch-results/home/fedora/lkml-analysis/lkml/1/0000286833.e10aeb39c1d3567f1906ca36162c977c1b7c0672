+	 * might sync with TX by write_lock_irqsave()'ing. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'led->type != LED_TYPE_ACTIVITY'
#466: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2x00leds.c:80:
+	if ((led->type != LED_TYPE_ACTIVITY) || !(led->flags & LED_REGISTERED))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
