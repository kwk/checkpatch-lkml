              ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#153: FILE: fs/select.c:741:
+	struct pollfd __user *ufds = (struct pollfd __user*)restart_block->arg0;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
