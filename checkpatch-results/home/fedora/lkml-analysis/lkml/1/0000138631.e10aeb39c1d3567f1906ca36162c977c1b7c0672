CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#190: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:261:
+extern int get_nohz_load_balancer(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#267: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:148:
+extern ktime_t clockevents_get_next_event(int cpu);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#272: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:153:
+	ktime_t ret;
+	ret.tv64 = KTIME_MAX;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
