Please tell me where that logic should really go (skbuff.h? br_netfilter.c?)

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#72: FILE: net/bridge/br_forward.c:119:
					return;

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 125 exceeds 100 columns
#78: FILE: net/bridge/br_forward.c:124:
+					if ((skb2->nf_bridge = kzalloc(sizeof(struct nf_bridge_info), GFP_ATOMIC)) == NULL) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#78: FILE: net/bridge/br_forward.c:124:
+					if ((skb2->nf_bridge = kzalloc(sizeof(struct nf_bridge_info), GFP_ATOMIC)) == NULL) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*skb2->nf_bridge)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct nf_bridge_info)...)
#78: FILE: net/bridge/br_forward.c:124:
+					if ((skb2->nf_bridge = kzalloc(sizeof(struct nf_bridge_info), GFP_ATOMIC)) == NULL) {

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around skb2->nf_bridge->use
#85: FILE: net/bridge/br_forward.c:131:
+					atomic_set(&(skb2->nf_bridge->use), 1);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
