CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#57: FILE: arch/x86/oprofile/op_model_athlon.c:51:
+#define IBS_FETCH_HIGH_VALID_BIT	(1UL << 17)	/* bit 49 */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#58: FILE: arch/x86/oprofile/op_model_athlon.c:52:
+#define IBS_FETCH_HIGH_ENABLE		(1UL << 16)	/* bit 48 */

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#68: FILE: arch/x86/oprofile/op_model_athlon.c:56:
+#define IBS_OP_LOW_VALID_BIT		(1ULL<<18)	/* bit 18 */
                             		     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
