WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#71: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma_32.c:91:
+		int high, mmu;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#75: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma_32.c:95:
+		if (force_iommu && !(gfp & GFP_DMA))
[...]
+		else if (high) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#82: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma_32.c:102:
+			/* Don't use the 16MB ZONE_DMA unless absolutely
+			   needed. It's better to use remapping first. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting
