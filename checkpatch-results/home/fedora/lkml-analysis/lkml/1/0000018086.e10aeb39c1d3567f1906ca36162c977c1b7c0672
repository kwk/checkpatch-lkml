Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#205: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep.c:132:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
