Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'uli526x_dynamic_reset', this function's name, in a string
#87: FILE: drivers/net/tulip/uli526x.c:1153:
+	ULI526X_DBUG(0, "uli526x_dynamic_reset()", 0);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
