WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#54: FILE: drivers/base/base.h:3:
+ * struct bus_type_private - structure to hold the private to the driver core portions of the bus_type structure.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#228: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:457:
+		error = sysfs_create_link(&bus->p->devices_kset->kobj,
 						&dev->kobj, dev->bus_id);

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*priv)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct bus_type_private)...)
#306: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:853:
+	priv = kzalloc(sizeof(struct bus_type_private), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
