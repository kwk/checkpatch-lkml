Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#74: FILE: tools/perf/util/thread.c:44:
+			struct map *pos = rb_entry(next, struct map, rb_node);
+			next = rb_next(&pos->rb_node);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!self->comm"
#97: FILE: tools/perf/util/thread.c:63:
+	err = self->comm == NULL ? -ENOMEM : 0;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
