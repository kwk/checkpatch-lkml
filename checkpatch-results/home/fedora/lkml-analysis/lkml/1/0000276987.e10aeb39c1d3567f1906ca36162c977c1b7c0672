ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#102: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_sched_wakeup.c:91:
+static struct ftrace_ops trace_ops __read_mostly =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
