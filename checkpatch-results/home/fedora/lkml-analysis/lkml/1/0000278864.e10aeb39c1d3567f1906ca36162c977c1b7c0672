Subject: [PATCH 01/57] Clean acquirewdt and check for BKL dependancies
                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#47: FILE: drivers/watchdog/acquirewdt.c:62:
+#include <linux/miscdevice.h>		/* For MODULE_ALIAS_MISCDEV

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
