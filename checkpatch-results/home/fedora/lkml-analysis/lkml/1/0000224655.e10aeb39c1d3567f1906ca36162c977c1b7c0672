CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Opt_inode64>
#92: FILE: fs/ocfs2/super.c:160:
+	Opt_inode64,

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#109: FILE: fs/ocfs2/super.c:417:
+	 * mess with other nodes */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:PREFER_SEQ_PUTS: Prefer seq_puts to seq_printf
#135: FILE: fs/ocfs2/super.c:1012:
+		seq_printf(s, ",inode64");
