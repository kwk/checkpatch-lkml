WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <GPIO_32_768kHz>
#152: FILE: arch/arm/mach-sa1100/clock.c:24:
+		GAFR |= GPIO_32_768kHz;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <TUCR_3_6864MHz>
#154: FILE: arch/arm/mach-sa1100/clock.c:26:
+		TUCR = TUCR_3_6864MHz;

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct clk_ops should normally be const
#173: FILE: arch/arm/mach-sa1100/clock.c:41:
+static struct clk_ops clk_gpio27_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxW)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <clk_3_6MHz>
#195: FILE: arch/arm/mach-sa1100/clock.c:52:

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#208: FILE: arch/arm/mach-sa1100/clock.c:58:
+static struct clk* clks[] = {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
