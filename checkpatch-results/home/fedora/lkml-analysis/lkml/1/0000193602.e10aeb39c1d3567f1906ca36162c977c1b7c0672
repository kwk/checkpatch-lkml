ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#59: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:1200:
+struct root_device
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*root)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct root_device)...)
#94: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:1235:
+	root = kzalloc(sizeof(struct root_device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#158: FILE: include/linux/device.h:488:
+extern struct device *__root_device_register(const char *name,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#164: FILE: include/linux/device.h:494:
+}
+extern void root_device_unregister(struct device *root);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
