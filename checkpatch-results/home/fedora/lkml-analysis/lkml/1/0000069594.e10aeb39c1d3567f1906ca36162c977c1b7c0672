ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#114: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/setup_64.c:592:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#122: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/setup_64.c:600:
+	for_each_node_state(i, N_NORMAL_MEMORY) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
