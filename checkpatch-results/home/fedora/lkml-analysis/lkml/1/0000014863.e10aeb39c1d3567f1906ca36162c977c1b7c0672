Subject: [PATCH 5/6] staging:rar_register: fix checkpatch errors and debug program file

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

#611: FILE: drivers/staging/rar_register/rar_register.c:413:
+	dev_dbg(&my_rar_device.rar_dev->dev, "rar_lock mutex locking\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#615: FILE: drivers/staging/rar_register/rar_register.c:417:
+	if (my_rar_device.registered) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
