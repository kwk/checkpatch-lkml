WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#60: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1161:
+ ^Iindex = page_cache_index(mapping, pos);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#60: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1161:
+ ^Iindex = page_cache_index(mapping, pos);$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#60: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1161:
+ ^Iindex = page_cache_index(mapping, pos);$

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#61: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1162:
+ ^Ifrom = page_cache_offset(mapping, pos);$

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#61: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1162:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#61: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1162:
+ ^Ifrom = page_cache_offset(mapping, pos);$

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#153: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1827:
+	unsigned offset = page_cache_offset(mapping, from);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#194: FILE: fs/ext4/writeback.c:288:
+	BUG_ON(page_cache_shift(inode->i_mapping) < blkbits);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#286: FILE: fs/ext4/writeback.c:1092:
+	unsigned offset = page_cache_offset(mapping, from);

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#295: FILE: fs/ext4/writeback.c:1153:
+	if (PAGE_SHIFT != sb->s_blocksize_bits) {

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#298: FILE: fs/ext4/writeback.c:1155:
 		printk(KERN_ERR "EXT4-fs: delayed allocation isn't"
+			"supported for PAGE_SIZE != blocksize yet\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:MISSING_SPACE: break quoted strings at a space character
#298: FILE: fs/ext4/writeback.c:1155:
 		printk(KERN_ERR "EXT4-fs: delayed allocation isn't"
+			"supported for PAGE_SIZE != blocksize yet\n");
