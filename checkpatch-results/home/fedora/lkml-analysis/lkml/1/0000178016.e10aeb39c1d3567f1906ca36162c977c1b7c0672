Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#67: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#72: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/txx9ndfmc.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#154: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/txx9ndfmc.c:83:
+	struct txx9ndfmc_priv *txx9_priv = chip->priv;
+	return txx9_priv->dev;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#291: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/txx9ndfmc.c:220:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: static const char * array should probably be static const char * const
#319: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/txx9ndfmc.c:248:
+	static const char *probes[] = { "cmdlinepart", NULL };

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*txx9_priv)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct txx9ndfmc_priv)...)
#373: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/txx9ndfmc.c:302:
+		txx9_priv = kzalloc(sizeof(struct txx9ndfmc_priv),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:OOM_MESSAGE: Possible unnecessary 'out of memory' message
#376: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/txx9ndfmc.c:305:
+		if (!txx9_priv) {
+			dev_err(&dev->dev, "Unable to allocate "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#377: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/txx9ndfmc.c:306:
+			dev_err(&dev->dev, "Unable to allocate "
+				"TXx9 NDFMC MTD device structure.\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
