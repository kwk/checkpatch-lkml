WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rmap_remove', this function's name, in a string
#37: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c:665:
+		pr_err("rmap_remove: %p %llx many->many\n", spte, *spte);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
