On my mid-2007 MacBook2, reading Ts0P sensor always failed with this message:

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
