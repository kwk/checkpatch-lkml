CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dws)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dw_dma_slave)...)

+		dws = kzalloc(sizeof(struct dw_dma_slave), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#319: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/atmel-mci.c:630:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
