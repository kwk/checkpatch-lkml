#14: 
Subject: [PATCH] Macintosh: fix brace and trailing statement coding style issues in adb-iop.c This is a patch to the adb-iop.c file that cleans up brace and trailing statement warnings found by the checkpatch.pl tool. Signed-off-by: Michael Beardsworth <mbeards2@uoregon.edu>

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'adb_iop_state == sending'
#67: FILE: drivers/macintosh/adb-iop.c:89:
+	if ((adb_iop_state == sending) && req && req->reply_expected)

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'adb_iop_listen', this function's name, in a string

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#80: FILE: drivers/macintosh/adb-iop.c:117:
+		req, (uint) amsg->count + 2, (uint) amsg->flags, (uint) amsg->cmd);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
