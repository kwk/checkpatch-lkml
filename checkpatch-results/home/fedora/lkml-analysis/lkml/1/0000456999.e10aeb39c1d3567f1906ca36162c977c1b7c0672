Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#100: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:192:
+extern unsigned long try_to_free_pages(struct zone **zones, int order,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+extern unsigned long try_to_free_pages(struct zone **zones, int order,
+					gfp_t gfp_mask);
