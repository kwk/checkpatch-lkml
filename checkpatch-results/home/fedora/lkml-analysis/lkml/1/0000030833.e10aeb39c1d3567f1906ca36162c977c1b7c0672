CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*port->write_fifo)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct kfifo)...)
#65: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:944:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
