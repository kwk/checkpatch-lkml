Subject: [PATCH 52/66] arch/m68k/hp300/time.h: Checkpatch cleanup

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: arch/m68k/hp300/time.h:2:
+extern unsigned long hp300_gettimeoffset(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
