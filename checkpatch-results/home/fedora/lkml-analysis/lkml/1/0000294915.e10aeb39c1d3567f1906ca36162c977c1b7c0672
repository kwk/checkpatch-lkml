#34: 
This was tested on a ARM926 base SoC with an IP based ethernet MAC (10/100 MBit) together with a Realtek RTL8201 MII and a SMCSC

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
