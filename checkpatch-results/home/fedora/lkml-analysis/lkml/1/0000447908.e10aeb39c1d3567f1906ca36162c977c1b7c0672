WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#207: FILE: mm/slub.c:1550:
+	 * Is the slab growing beyond the next order boundary? */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#228: FILE: mm/slub.c:1571:
+static int check_slab_challenged_slab(struct kmem_cache *s) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
