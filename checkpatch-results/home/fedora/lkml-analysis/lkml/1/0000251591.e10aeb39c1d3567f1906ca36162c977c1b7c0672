spaces are never used for indentation.

patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

#501: FILE: kernel/panic.c:329:
+#warning You have selected the CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR option, but the gcc used does not support this.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
