Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#126: FILE: kernel/power/Kconfig:119:
+config PM_DISABLE_CONSOLE
+	bool "Disable Power Management messing with the active console"
+	depends on PM
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  By default, PM will take over the active console (generally, this means
+	  switching to the console when suspending from X). This can at times cause
+	  problems, especially if userspace suspend scripts try to do things with
+	  the console before or after suspending (e.g. calling vbestate).
+
+	  To work around this, enable this option so that PM will not handle the
+	  console.
+
+	  Note, this is the same as passing vt_switch=0 command line option, but
+	  just hardcodes the default. You can still pass vt_switch=1 with this
+	  option to get original behavior.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
