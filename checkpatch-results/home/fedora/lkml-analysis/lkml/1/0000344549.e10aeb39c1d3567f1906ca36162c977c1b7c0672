Subject: [PATCH 07/15] change irq functions to accomodate x86_64
                                               ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#31: 
in paravirt.h (like raw_local_irq_disable) to accomodate for x86_64.
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#55: FILE: include/asm-x86/paravirt.h:1096:
+ * caller saved registers but the argument parameter */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
