CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#39: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:184:
+extern int queue_work_on_cpu(struct workqueue_struct *wq,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#40: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:185:
+extern int queue_work_on_cpu(struct workqueue_struct *wq,
+			struct work_struct *work, int cpu);
