#29: 
Added device ids to hid-quriks for detection of keyboards on 4th generation Macbook Pro and Macbook Air

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 123 exceeds 100 columns
#58: FILE: drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-quirks.c:582:
+	{ USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_WELLSPRING_ISO, HID_QUIRK_APPLE_HAS_FN | HID_QUIRK_APPLE_ISO_KEYBOARD },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
