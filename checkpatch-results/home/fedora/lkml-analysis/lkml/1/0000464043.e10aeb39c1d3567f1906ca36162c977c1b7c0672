ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#58: 
--- a/include/asm-i386/semaphore.h	Wed Feb 21 13:02:17 2007 -0800

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/asm-i386/semaphore.h:92:
+extern void down_timeout_interruptible(struct semaphore *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct semaphore *' should also have an identifier name
#65: FILE: include/asm-i386/semaphore.h:92:
+extern void down_timeout_interruptible(struct semaphore *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#79: FILE: lib/semaphore-sleepers.c:179:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#80: FILE: lib/semaphore-sleepers.c:180:
+struct dit_data 
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
