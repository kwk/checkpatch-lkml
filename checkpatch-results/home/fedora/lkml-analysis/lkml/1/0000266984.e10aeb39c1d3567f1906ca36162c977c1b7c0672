WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#52: FILE: drivers/char/Kconfig:124:
+config COMPUTONE_FIRMWARE
+	bool "Firmware for Computone IntelliPort Plus serial devices"
+	depends on COMPUTONE
+	---help---
+	  This builds the firmware for the Intelliport Plus devices into the
+	  kernel image. Say 'N' and let it get loaded by udev.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#107: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:160:
+int ip2_loadmain(int *, int *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int *' should also have an identifier name
#107: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:160:
+int ip2_loadmain(int *, int *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int *' should also have an identifier name
#107: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:160:
+int ip2_loadmain(int *, int *);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#124: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:477:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#170: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:657:
+		/* We don't want to request the firmware unless we have at
+		   least one board */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
