CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#105: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:325:
+extern u64 ktime_divns(const ktime_t kt, s64 div);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
#108: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:327:
+# define ktime_divns(kt, div)		(u64)((kt).tv64 / (div))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#220: FILE: fs/timerfd.c:52:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
