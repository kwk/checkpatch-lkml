WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'childs' may be misspelled - perhaps 'children'?
#37: 
The cumul hits are the number of hits of every childs of a node
                                               ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#83: FILE: tools/perf/util/callchain.c:160:
+	new->cumul_hit = new->hit = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
