ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#152: FILE: arch/arm/common/rtctime.c:188:
file *file, unsigned int cmd,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#233: FILE: arch/arm/common/rtctime.c:343:
+static long rtc_fioctl(struct file_operations rtc_fops)

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
