Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#109: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/kerneltop.c:1089:
+		case 'm': mmap_pages			=   atoi(optarg); break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#136: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/kerneltop.c:1160:
+		fprintf(stderr, "WARNING: failed to keep up with mmap data.  Last read %lu msecs ago.\n", msecs);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
