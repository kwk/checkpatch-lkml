ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#158: FILE: include/linux/blktrace_api.h:197:
*q, char *name, dev_t dev,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#162: FILE: include/linux/blktrace_api.h:201:
+extern void blk_trace_remove_sysfs(struct device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
