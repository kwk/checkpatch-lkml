Subject: [PATCH] mm/slab.c: fix sparse warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after initkmem_list3[NUM_INIT_LISTS]
#54: FILE: mm/slab.c:309:
+static struct kmem_list3 __initdata initkmem_list3[NUM_INIT_LISTS];

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around ac->entry[tofree]
#90: FILE: mm/slab.c:2459:
+			memmove(ac->entry, &(ac->entry[tofree]),

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
