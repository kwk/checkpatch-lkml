WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#106: FILE: fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c:45:
+	struct dnotify_mark_entry *dnentry  = container_of(entry, struct dnotify_mark_entry, fsn_entry);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dn"
#116: FILE: fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c:52:
+	for (; dn != NULL; dn = dn->dn_next)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'alreay' may be misspelled - perhaps 'already'?
#142: FILE: fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c:78:
+	/* unlikely since we alreay passed dnotify_should_send_event() */
 	                     ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#156: FILE: fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c:92:
+		if (dn->dn_mask & FS_DN_MULTISHOT)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#177: FILE: fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c:113:
+	/* !dir_notify_enable should never get here, don't waste time checking
+	if (!dir_notify_enable)

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#209: FILE: fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c:145:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
