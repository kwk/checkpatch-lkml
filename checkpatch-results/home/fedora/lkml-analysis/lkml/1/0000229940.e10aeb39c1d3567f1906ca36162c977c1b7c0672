CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp.h:103:
+extern struct slot *alloc_slot_struct(struct device_node *dn, int drc_index, int power_domain);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#83: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp.h:104:
+extern int rpaphp_register_slot(struct slot *slot, const char *name);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rpaphp_register_slot', this function's name, in a string
#223: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp_slot.c:124:
+		err("rpaphp_register_slot: slot[%s] is already registered\n", slot_name(slot));

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
