WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct regulator_ops should normally be const
#122: FILE: drivers/regulator/core.c:767:
+	struct regulator_ops *ops = rdev->desc->ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
