#27: 
commit bd44e2b007bc9024bce3357c185b38c73f87c3dd is obviously bogus:

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#31: 
--- a/fs/dlm/lowcomms-tcp.c

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
