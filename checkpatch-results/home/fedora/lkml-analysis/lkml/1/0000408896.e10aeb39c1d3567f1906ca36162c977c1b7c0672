WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#86: FILE: fs/gfs2/quota.c:576:
+	unsigned offset = loc & (PAGE_CACHE_SIZE - 1);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/linux/gfs2_ondisk.h:522:
+extern void gfs2_quota_out(const struct gfs2_quota_host *qu, void *buf);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
