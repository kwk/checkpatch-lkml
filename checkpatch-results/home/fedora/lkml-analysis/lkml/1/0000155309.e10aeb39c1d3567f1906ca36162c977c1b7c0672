CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#108: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h:121:
+#define _TIF_SYSCALL_FTRACE	(1 << TIF_SYSCALL_FTRACE)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#145: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/ftrace.c:460:
+extern unsigned long __stop_syscalls_metadata[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
