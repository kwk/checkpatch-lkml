CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: include/asm-s390/timer.h:51:
+extern unsigned long long cpu_clock(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#119: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/vtime.c:43:
+	BUG_ON(timer->cpu != smp_processor_id());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
