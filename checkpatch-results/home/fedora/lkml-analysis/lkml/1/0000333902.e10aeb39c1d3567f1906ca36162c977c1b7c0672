CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'inode->i_size > ip->i_di.di_size'
#105: FILE: fs/gfs2/ops_address.c:851:
+	if (likely(ret >= 0) && (inode->i_size > ip->i_di.di_size)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
