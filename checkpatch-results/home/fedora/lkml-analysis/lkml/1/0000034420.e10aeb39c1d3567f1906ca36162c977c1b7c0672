CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#154: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:374:
+				hw->left = hw->right = hw->middle = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
