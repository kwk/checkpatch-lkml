CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#65: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c:11:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#83: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c:270:
+	memcpy(swapper_pg_dir, swapper_pg_dir + KERNEL_PGD_BOUNDARY,
 		sizeof(swapper_pg_dir [0]) * KERNEL_PGD_PTRS);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#155: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pgtable.c:115:
+	memset(pgd, 0, KERNEL_PGD_BOUNDARY*sizeof(pgd_t));
 	                                  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
