WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#104: FILE: drivers/oprofile/buffer_sync.c:245:
 	for (vma = find_vma(mm, addr); vma; vma = vma->vm_next) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
