CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#82: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:963:
+		current->mm->brk = current->mm->start_brk = new_brk;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#93: FILE: arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_binfmt.c:265:
+extern void arch_randomize_brk(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
