WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#36: 
#include <linux/kernel.h>

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+#define NUM_CHANNELS ARRAY_SIZE(p80211wext_channel_freq)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
