#28: 
On IA64, the timer interrupt is not (always?) zero as it is on x86 platforms.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#109: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:276:
+extern void set_timer_interrupt(unsigned int irq);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#157: FILE: include/asm-ia64/hw_irq.h:98:
+extern int register_percpu_irq (ia64_vector vec, struct irqaction *action);
