CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#87: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:383:
+		drive->probed_capacity = drive->capacity64 = 1ULL << 28;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ide_drive_s *' should also have an identifier name
#158: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:384:
+	u64		(*set_capacity)(struct ide_drive_s *, u64);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'u64' should also have an identifier name
#158: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:384:
+	u64		(*set_capacity)(struct ide_drive_s *, u64);
