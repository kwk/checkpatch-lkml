CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#52: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:150:
+extern struct kset * __must_check kset_create_and_register(const char *name,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct kset_uevent_ops should normally be const
#53: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:151:
+							   struct kset_uevent_ops *u,

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#78: FILE: lib/kobject.c:669:
+	struct kset *kset = container_of(kobj, struct kset, kobj);
+	pr_debug("kset %s: now freed\n", kobject_name(kobj));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
