CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#83: FILE: drivers/mtd/maps/physmap.c:50:
+	if (info->nr_parts) {
[...]
+	} else if (physmap_data->nr_parts)
[...]
+	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "info->mtd[i]"
#110: FILE: drivers/mtd/maps/physmap.c:67:
+		if (info->mtd[i] != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#132: FILE: drivers/mtd/maps/physmap.c:170:
+	err = parse_mtd_partitions(info->cmtd, part_probe_types,
+				&info->parts, 0);
