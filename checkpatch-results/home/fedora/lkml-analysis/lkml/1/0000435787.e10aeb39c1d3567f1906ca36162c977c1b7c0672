CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs.h:74:
+extern int set_attr(const char *file, struct hostfs_iattr *attrs, int fd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
