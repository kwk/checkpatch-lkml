The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#346: FILE: fs/open.c:832:
+	f->f_mode = (__force fmode_t)((flags+1) & O_ACCMODE) |
 	                                    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#403: FILE: include/linux/ima.h:23:
+extern int ima_path_check(struct file *file);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
