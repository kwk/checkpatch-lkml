CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:219:
+extern void scan_zone_noreclaim_pages(struct zone *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct zone *' should also have an identifier name
#66: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:219:
+extern void scan_zone_noreclaim_pages(struct zone *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#131: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:2300:
+			struct page* page = lru_to_page(l_noreclaim);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#153: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:2322:

+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#216: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:2385:

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#230: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:2399:
+static SYSDEV_ATTR(scan_noreclaim_pages, S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
