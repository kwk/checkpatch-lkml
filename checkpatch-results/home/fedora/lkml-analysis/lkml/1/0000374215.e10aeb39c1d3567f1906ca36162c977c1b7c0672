#135: FILE: fs/Kconfig:1380:
+config MINIX_FS
+	tristate "Minix fs support"
+	---help---
+	  Minix is a simple operating system used in many classes about OSs.
+	  The minix file system (method to organize files on a hard disk
+	  partition or a floppy disk) was the original file system for Linux,
+	  but has been superseded by the second extended file system ext2fs.
+	  You don't want to use the minix file system on your hard disk
+	  because of certain built-in restrictions, but it is sometimes found
+	  on older Linux floppy disks. This option will enlarge your kernel
+	  by about 28 KB. If unsure, say N.
 
+	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called minix. Note that the file system of your root
+	  partition (the one containing the directory /) cannot be compiled as
+	  a module.
 
 config QNX4FS_FS
 	tristate "QNX4 file system support (read only)"
