CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#131: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c:633:
+		scmd->sg_table.nents = scmd->sg_table.orig_nents = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
