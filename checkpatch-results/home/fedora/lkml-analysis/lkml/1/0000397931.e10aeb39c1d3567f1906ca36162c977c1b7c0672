WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#47: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/ftdi-elan.c:2780:
+        struct usb_ftdi *ftdi;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#47: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/ftdi-elan.c:2780:
+        struct usb_ftdi *ftdi;$

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ftdi)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct usb_ftdi)...)
#49: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/ftdi-elan.c:2782:
+	ftdi = kzalloc(sizeof(struct usb_ftdi), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
