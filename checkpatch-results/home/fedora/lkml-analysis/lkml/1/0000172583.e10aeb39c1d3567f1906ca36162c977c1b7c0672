is that __exit_signal() needs ensurance that that worklet isn't

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Not-signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form

Not-Signed-off-by: Peter Zijlstra <a.p.zijlstra@chello.nl>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: include/linux/init_task.h:17:
+extern void do_thread_group_cputime_update(struct work_struct *work);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+	INIT_DELAYED_WORK(&sig->cputime.work,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#301: FILE: kernel/sched.c:4479:
+	if (schedule_delayed_work(&sig->cputime.work,

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#318: FILE: kernel/sched.c:4496:
+	n = t = sig->curr_target;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#319: FILE: kernel/sched.c:4497:
+	if (n) do {

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
