#33: 
* Provides an interface to selectively freeze the system for different events.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#95: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:7:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#112: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:23:
+#define FE_SUSPEND	(1 << TFF_FE_SUSPEND) /* Software Suspend */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#161: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:119:
+extern int freeze_processes(unsigned long freeze_event);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#162: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:120:
+extern void thaw_processes(unsigned long freeze_event);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#179: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:190:
+static inline int freeze_processes(unsigned long) { BUG(); return 0; }

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TABSTOP: Statements should start on a tabstop

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
