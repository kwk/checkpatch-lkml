WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#97: FILE: drivers/xen/events.c:472:
+			(get_irq_regs() && i == cpu) ? xen_irqs_disabled(get_irq_regs()) : v->evtchn_upcall_mask,

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
