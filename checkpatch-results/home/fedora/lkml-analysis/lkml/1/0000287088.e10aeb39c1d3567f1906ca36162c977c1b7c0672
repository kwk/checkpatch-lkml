Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_INT: Prefer 'unsigned long' over 'unsigned long int' as the int is unnecessary

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#328: FILE: drivers/oprofile/cpu_buffer.c:233:
+void oprofile_add_value(unsigned long value, int cpu) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#329: FILE: drivers/oprofile/cpu_buffer.c:234:
+	struct oprofile_cpu_buffer * cpu_buf = &cpu_buffer[cpu];

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#381: FILE: drivers/oprofile/oprof.c:56:
+	if (oprofile_ops.sync_start

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#382: FILE: drivers/oprofile/oprof.c:57:
+	if (oprofile_ops.sync_start
+	    && ((err = oprofile_ops.sync_start())))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#487: FILE: drivers/oprofile/event_buffer.h:20:
  
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
