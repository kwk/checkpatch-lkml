ERROR:EXECUTE_PERMISSIONS: do not set execute permissions for source files
#248: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_mv.c

There is no reason for source files to be executable.  The executable
bit can be removed safely.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
