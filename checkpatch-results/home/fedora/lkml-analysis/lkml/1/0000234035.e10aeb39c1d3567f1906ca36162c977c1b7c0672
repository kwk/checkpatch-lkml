Subject: [PATCH] Fix problem with waiting while holding rcu read lock in md/bitmap.c

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#96: FILE: drivers/md/bitmap.c:252:
+	struct list_head *pos;
+	rcu_read_lock();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rdev"
#97: FILE: drivers/md/bitmap.c:253:
+	if (rdev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#103: FILE: drivers/md/bitmap.c:259:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
