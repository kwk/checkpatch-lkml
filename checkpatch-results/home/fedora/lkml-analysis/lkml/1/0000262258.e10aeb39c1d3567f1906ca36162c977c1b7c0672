#28: 
NICE_0_LOAD range. Hierarchical task groups break this assumption - fix this

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#61: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3139:
+		sum_avg_load_per_task = avg_load_per_task = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#80: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3197:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#91: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3208:
+		avg_load_per_task = sg_div_cpu_power(group,
+				sum_avg_load_per_task * SCHED_LOAD_SCALE);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
