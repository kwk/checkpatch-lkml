This adds an optional wrapper around ata_ac_issue_prot that triggers the LED layer.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#64: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:5587:
+^Iledtrig_ide_activity();^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#104: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:793:
+extern unsigned int ata_qc_issue_prot_ledtrigger(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
