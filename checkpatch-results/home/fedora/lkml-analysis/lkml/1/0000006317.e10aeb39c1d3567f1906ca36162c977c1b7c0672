WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#20: 
Subject: [tip:perf/core] percpu: Add __percpu sparse annotations to hw_breakpoint

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: include/linux/hw_breakpoint.h:76:
+extern void unregister_wide_hw_breakpoint(struct perf_event * __percpu *cpu_events);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct perf_event * __percpu' should also have an identifier name
#81: FILE: include/linux/hw_breakpoint.h:76:
+extern void unregister_wide_hw_breakpoint(struct perf_event * __percpu *cpu_events);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'pevent' may be misspelled - perhaps 'prevent'?
