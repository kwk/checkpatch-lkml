WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'persistant' may be misspelled - perhaps 'persistent'?
#50: 
  set the flag to say that there is persistant metadata.
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#110: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:4307:
+	 * RUN_ARRAY, and GET_ and SET_BITMAP_FILE are allowed */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
