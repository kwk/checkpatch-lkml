WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "list"
#69: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2770:
+	while (*list != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#73: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2774:
+			printk("__dev_addr_discard: address leakage! "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '__dev_addr_discard', this function's name, in a string
#73: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2774:
+			printk("__dev_addr_discard: address leakage! "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#74: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2775:
+			printk("__dev_addr_discard: address leakage! "
+			       "da_users=%d\n", tmp->da_users);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
