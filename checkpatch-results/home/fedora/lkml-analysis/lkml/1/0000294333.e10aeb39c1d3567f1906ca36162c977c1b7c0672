ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#146: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:162:
+        end = buffer + buflen;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#146: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:162:
+        end = buffer + buflen;$

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#149: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:165:
+	startbit = bit = (goal % GFS2_NBBY) * GFS2_BIT_SIZE;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#187: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:193:
+	/* Stop at "end - 1" or else prefetch can go past the end and segfault.
+	   We could "if" it but we'd lose some of the performance gained.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#191: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:197:
+	   but this one seems to be the fastest. */
