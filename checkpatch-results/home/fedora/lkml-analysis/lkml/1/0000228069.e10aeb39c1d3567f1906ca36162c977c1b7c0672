Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#52: FILE: drivers/acpi/numa.c:157:
+			u8 val = slit->entry[d*i + j];
+			boot_printk(BOOT_VERBOSE, " %d", val);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
