The following changes since commit e07cccf4046978df10f2e13fe2b99b2f9b3a65db:

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#162: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:379:
+	unsigned pages = (size + PAGE_SIZE - 1) / PAGE_SIZE;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#171: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:388:
+	BUG_ON(size > 65536);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#220: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:653:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
