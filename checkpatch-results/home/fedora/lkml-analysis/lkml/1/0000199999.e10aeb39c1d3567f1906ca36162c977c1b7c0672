CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1793:
+extern int sigkill_pending(struct task_struct *tsk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#99: FILE: mm/memory.c:1225:
+			if (unlikely(sigkill_pending(current) ||
+					sigkill_pending(tsk)))
