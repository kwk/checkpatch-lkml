cmsg)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#73: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capidrv.c:514:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "capidrv::send_message: can't allocate mem\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'send_message', this function's name, in a string
#73: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capidrv.c:514:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "capidrv::send_message: can't allocate mem\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
