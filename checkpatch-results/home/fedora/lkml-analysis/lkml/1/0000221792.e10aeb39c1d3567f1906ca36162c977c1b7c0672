Currently softirq context cannot use PF_MEMALLOC due to it not being associated

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#73: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1455:
+		else if (!in_interrupt() &&
+				unlikely(test_thread_flag(TIF_MEMDIE)))

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#86: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:217:

+	current->flags &= ~PF_MEMALLOC;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
