ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#172: FILE: kernel/rtmutex.c:628:
+	struct lock_waiter_state lock_waiter =
+		{ .lock_type = RT_MUTEX_WAITER, { .rt_blocked_on = &waiter} };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
