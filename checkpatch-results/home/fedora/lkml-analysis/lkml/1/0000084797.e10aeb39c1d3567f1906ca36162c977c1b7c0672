CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#71: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:593:
+	if (cpa->flags & CPA_PAGES_ARRAY) {
[...]
+	} else if (cpa->flags & CPA_ARRAY)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#73: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:595:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
