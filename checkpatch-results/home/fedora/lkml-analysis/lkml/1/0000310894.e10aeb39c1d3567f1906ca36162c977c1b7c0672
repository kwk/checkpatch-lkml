CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#258: FILE: fs/ocfs2/journal.c:67:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*rm)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ocfs2_recovery_map)...)
#278: FILE: fs/ocfs2/journal.c:87:
+	rm = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ocfs2_recovery_map) +

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#295: FILE: fs/ocfs2/journal.c:104:
+ * being woken up */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "osb->recovery_thread_task"
#299: FILE: fs/ocfs2/journal.c:108:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#357: FILE: fs/ocfs2/journal.c:166:
+	BUG_ON(rm->rm_used >= osb->max_slots);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around rm->rm_entries[i]
#381: FILE: fs/ocfs2/journal.c:190:
+		memmove(&(rm->rm_entries[i]), &(rm->rm_entries[i + 1]),

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
