ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to false
#259: FILE: drivers/staging/winbond/mto.c:54:
+static u8 boSparseTxTraffic = false;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <boSparseTxTraffic>
#259: FILE: drivers/staging/winbond/mto.c:54:
+static u8 boSparseTxTraffic = false;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
