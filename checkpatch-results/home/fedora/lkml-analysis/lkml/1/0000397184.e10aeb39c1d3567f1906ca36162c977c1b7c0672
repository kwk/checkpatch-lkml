CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*state)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct icside_state)...)
#90: FILE: drivers/ide/arm/icside.c:696:
+	state = kzalloc(sizeof(struct icside_state), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#183: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/cs5535.c:90:
+		cmd = pioa = speed - XFER_PIO_0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#391: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/piix.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
