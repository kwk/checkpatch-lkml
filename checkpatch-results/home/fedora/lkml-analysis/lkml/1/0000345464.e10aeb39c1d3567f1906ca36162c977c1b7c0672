WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#108: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:823:
+DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL,	insert-your-device-id-here,	quirk_transparent_bridge );

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
