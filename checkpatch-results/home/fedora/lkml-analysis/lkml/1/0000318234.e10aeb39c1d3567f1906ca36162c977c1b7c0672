CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: include/linux/skbuff.h:899:
+extern unsigned char *skb_put(struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#100: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:872:
+	unsigned char *tmp = skb_tail_pointer(skb);
+	SKB_LINEAR_ASSERT(skb);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
