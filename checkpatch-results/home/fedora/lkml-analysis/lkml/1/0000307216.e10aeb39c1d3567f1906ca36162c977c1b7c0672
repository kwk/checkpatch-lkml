CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/timex.h:213:
+extern void ntp_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_notice([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_notice(dev, ... then pr_notice(...  to printk(KERN_NOTICE ...

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#217: FILE: kernel/time/ntp.c:329:
+					hrtimer_start(&leap_timer, ktime_set(sec, 0), HRTIMER_MODE_ABS);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
