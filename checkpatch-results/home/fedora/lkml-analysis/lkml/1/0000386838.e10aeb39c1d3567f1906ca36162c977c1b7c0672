WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#65: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c		Version 1.12	Aug 25, 2007

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
