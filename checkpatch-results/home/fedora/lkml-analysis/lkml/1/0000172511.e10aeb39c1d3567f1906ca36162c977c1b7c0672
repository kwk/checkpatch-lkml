CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'rw' may be better as '(rw)' to avoid precedence issues
#65: FILE: block/blktrace.c:155:
+#define MASK_TC_BIT(rw, __name) ((rw & (1 << BIO_RW_ ## __name)) << \
+	  (ilog2(BLK_TC_ ## __name) + BLK_TC_SHIFT - BIO_RW_ ## __name))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bt"
#110: FILE: block/blktrace.c:543:
+	if (bt == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
