CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#72: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c:886:
+	c->eip = c->eip_orig = kvm_rip_read(ctxt->vcpu);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
