CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#136: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/xsave.h:34:
+extern void update_regset_xstate_info(unsigned int size, u64 xstate_mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#155: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/i387.c:234:
+int xstateregs_get(struct task_struct *target, const struct user_regset *regset,

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#199: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/i387.c:278:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#221: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/i387.c:300:
+	xsave_hdr->reserved1[0] = xsave_hdr->reserved1[1] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
