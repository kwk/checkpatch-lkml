#35: 
Changed write_super_lockfs so that it returns an error in case of an failure.

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('
#58: FILE: fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_super.c:1355:
+xfs_fs_freeze(

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#126: FILE: fs/xfs/xfs_fsops.h:28:
+extern int xfs_fs_log_dummy(xfs_mount_t *mp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
