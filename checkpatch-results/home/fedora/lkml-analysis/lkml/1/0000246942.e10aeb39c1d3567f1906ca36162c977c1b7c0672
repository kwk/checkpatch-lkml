Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#49: 
--- a/include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h~zero-based-percpu-use-vmlinux_symbol-in-include-asm-generic-vmlinuxldsh

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
