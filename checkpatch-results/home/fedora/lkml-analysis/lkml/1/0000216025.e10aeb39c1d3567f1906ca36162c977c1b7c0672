#33: 
X86 LTTng timestamping. Depends on ltt-test-tsc module to detect if timestamp

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#54: FILE: include/asm-x86/ltt.h:1:
+#ifndef _ASM_X86_LTT_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#57: FILE: include/asm-x86/ltt.h:4:
+ * linux/include/asm-x86/ltt.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#116: FILE: include/asm-x86/ltt.h:63:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
