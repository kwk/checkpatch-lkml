#37:

                  ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#129: FILE: fs/Kconfig:500:
+config OCFS2_COMPAT_JBD
+	bool "Use JBD for compatibility"
+	depends on OCFS2_FS
+	default n
+	select JBD
+	help
+	  The ocfs2 filesystem now uses JBD2 for its journalling.  JBD2
+	  is backwards compatible with JBD.  It is safe to say N here.
+	  However, if you really want to use the original JBD, say Y here.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#183: FILE: fs/ocfs2/alloc.c:6461:
+	if (ret < 0)
[...]
+	else if (ocfs2_should_order_data(inode)) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#404: FILE: fs/ocfs2/journal.c:345:
+		     "jbd2_journal_extend failed, trying "
+		     "jbd2_journal_restart\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
