CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#309: FILE: arch/arm/include/asm/smp.h:105:
+extern void arch_send_call_function_ipi_mask(const struct cpumask *mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
