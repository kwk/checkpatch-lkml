The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#246: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event.c:2380:

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*nb)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct amd_nb)...)
#279: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event.c:2733:
+	nb = kmalloc(sizeof(struct amd_nb), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#288: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event.c:2742:
+	 * initialize all possible NB constraints
+   */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
