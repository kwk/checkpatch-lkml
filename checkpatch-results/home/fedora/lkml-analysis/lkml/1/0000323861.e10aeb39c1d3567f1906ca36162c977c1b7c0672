CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#81: FILE: splice.c:1457:
+	error = ret = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#98: FILE: splice.c:1474:
+	if (unlikely(!base)) {
+		return -EFAULT;	
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#99: FILE: splice.c:1475:
+^I^Ireturn -EFAULT;^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
