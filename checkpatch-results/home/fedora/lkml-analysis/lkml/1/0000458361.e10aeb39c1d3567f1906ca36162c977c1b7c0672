WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#326: FILE: arch/i386/lguest/page_tables.c:102:
+ * Return true if we got page. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#348: FILE: arch/i386/lguest/page_tables.c:336:
+	hype_pte_page[(unsigned long)pages / PAGE_SIZE % PTES_PER_PAGE]
+		= (__pa(lg->regs_page) | _PAGE_KERNEL);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#375: FILE: arch/i386/lguest/segments.c:34:
+	if (lg->regs->ds / 8 == desc
+	    || lg->regs->cs / 8 == desc

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
