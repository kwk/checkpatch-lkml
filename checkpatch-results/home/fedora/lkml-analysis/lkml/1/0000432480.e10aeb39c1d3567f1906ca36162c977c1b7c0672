Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#82: FILE: include/linux/kmod.h:58:
+/* Free the subprocess_info. This is only needed if you're not going

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!info"
#92: FILE: include/linux/kmod.h:67:
+	if (info == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!info"

+	if (info == NULL)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#169: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:278:
+	struct subprocess_info *sub_info;
+	sub_info = kzalloc(sizeof(struct subprocess_info),  GFP_ATOMIC);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*sub_info)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct subprocess_info)...)
#169: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:278:
+	sub_info = kzalloc(sizeof(struct subprocess_info),  GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
