Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#89: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:73:
+#define IRQ_NESTED_THREAD	0x10000000	/* IRQ is nested into another, no own handler thread */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#117: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:390:
+extern void set_irq_nested_thread(unsigned int irq, int nest);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
