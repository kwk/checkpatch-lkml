Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!al.sym"
#302: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:951:
+	    al.sym == NULL || al.filtered)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#330: FILE: tools/perf/util/event.c:310:
+		unsigned int slen = strlen(self->name);
+		if (slen > dsos__col_width)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
