      NFS: Ensure we return zero if applications attempt to write zero bytes

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#148: FILE: fs/nfs/direct.c:354:
+	return result < 0 ? (ssize_t) result : -EFAULT;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#164: FILE: fs/nfs/direct.c:370:

+		result = nfs_direct_read_schedule_segment(dreq, vec, pos);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sb->s_root"
#389: FILE: fs/nfs/getroot.c:52:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?

 			^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'gss_validate', this function's name, in a string
#614: FILE: net/sunrpc/auth_gss/auth_gss.c:970:
+		dprintk("RPC: %5u gss_validate: gss_verify_mic returned "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#628: FILE: net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_krb5_mech.c:151:
+		p = ERR_PTR(-ENOSYS);

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

+		p = ERR_PTR(-ENOSYS);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#650: FILE: net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_krb5_seal.c:86:
+	BUG_ON(ctx == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
