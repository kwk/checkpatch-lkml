ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#64: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/aperture_64.c:29:
+int gart_aperture_disabled __initdata = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

+int gart_aperture_allowed __initdata = 0;

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#166: FILE: include/asm-x86/gart.h:12:
+extern void gart_hole_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
