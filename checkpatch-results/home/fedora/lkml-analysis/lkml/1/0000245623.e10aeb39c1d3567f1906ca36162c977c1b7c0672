WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#40:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#57: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/salinfo.c:195:
+	if (down_trylock(&data->mutex)) { ; }; /* Ignore return value */

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
