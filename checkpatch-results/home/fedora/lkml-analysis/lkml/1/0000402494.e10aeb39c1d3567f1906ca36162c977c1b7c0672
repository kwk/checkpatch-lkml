CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1699:
+extern void bdi_ra_init(struct backing_dev_info *bdi);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#89: FILE: mm/readahead.c:62:
+	ra_pages = int_sqrt(totalram_pages/16);
 	                                  ^
