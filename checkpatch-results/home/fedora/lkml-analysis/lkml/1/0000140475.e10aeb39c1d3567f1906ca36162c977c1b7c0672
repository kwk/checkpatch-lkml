For x86: swiotlb_dma_ops can be static, because it's not used outside pci-swiotlb.c

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dma_map_ops should normally be const

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
