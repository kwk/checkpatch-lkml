#34: 
I noticed a bug with respect to time drifting after multiple sleep/wakeup sequence. We have an embedded ARM11 based platform on which we have successfuly ported Linux. We also have a RTC on board. Hence we have implemented the read_persistent_clock() function overriding the one defined in kernel/time/timekeeping.c. What we observed was that after doing multiple sleep/wakeup sequences, the time reported by RTC and gettimeofday was drifting. After about 10 iterations the gettimeofday was lagging by about one second. Subsequently the lag only increased. 

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'successfuly' may be misspelled - perhaps 'successfully'?

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
