WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#16: 
Subject: [PATCH 1/4] x86-64: Calgary - fix few style problems pointed out by checkpatch.pl

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#47: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-calgary.c:381:
+	BUG_ON(pdev->bus->parent &&

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
