Perhaps this is not enough. To help finding an optimal depth, we measure now

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#87: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h:24:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
