#30: 
Also, introduce a few inline helper functions to make the code more readable.

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#115: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_hca.c:124:
 	props->max_total_mcast_qp_attach
+		= limit_uint(rblock->max_total_mcast_qp_attach);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#192: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_hca.c:203:
+	props->active_mtu = props->max_mtu = map_mtu(shca, rblock->max_mtu);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#196: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_hca.c:206:
+	if (rblock->max_msg_sz) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
