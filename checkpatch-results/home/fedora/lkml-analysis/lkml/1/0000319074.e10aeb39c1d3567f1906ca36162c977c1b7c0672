WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#348: FILE: fs/libfs/dentry.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#349: FILE: fs/libfs/dentry.c:2:
+ *	fs/libfs/dentry.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#360: FILE: fs/libfs/dentry.c:13:
+#include <asm/uaccess.h>

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#366: FILE: fs/libfs/dentry.c:19:
+	struct inode *inode = dentry->d_inode;
+	generic_fillattr(inode, stat);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#394: FILE: fs/libfs/dentry.c:47:
+struct dentry *simple_lookup(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)
                                                                                          ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#396: FILE: fs/libfs/dentry.c:49:
+	static struct dentry_operations simple_dentry_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
