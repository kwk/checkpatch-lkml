+	---help---
+	The Simple Firmware Interface (SFI) provides a lightweight method
+	for platform firmware to pass information to the operating system
+	via static tables in memory.  Kernel SFI support is required to
+	boot on SFI-only platforms.  Currently, all SFI-only platforms are
+	based on the 2nd generation Intel Atom processor platform,
+	code-named Moorestown.
+
+	For more information, see http://simplefirmware.org
+
+	Say 'Y' here to enable the kernel to boot on SFI-only platforms.
