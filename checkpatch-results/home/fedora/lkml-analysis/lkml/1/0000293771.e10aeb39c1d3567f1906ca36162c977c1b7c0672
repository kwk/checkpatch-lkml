Subject: [PATCH] kgdb: trivial sparse fixes in kgdb test-suite

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#227: FILE: drivers/misc/kgdbts.c:882:
+		fork_test = simple_strtol(ptr + 1, NULL, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
