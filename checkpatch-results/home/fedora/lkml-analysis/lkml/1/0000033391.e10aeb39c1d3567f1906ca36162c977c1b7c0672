WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#59: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c:933:
+#define ipmi_si_set_not_busy(timespec) \
+	do { (timespec)->tv_nsec = -1; } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#71: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c:945:
+	if (max_busy_us == 0 || smi_result != SI_SM_CALL_WITH_DELAY)
[...]
+	else if (!ipmi_si_is_busy(busy_until)) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#75: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c:949:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#78: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c:952:
+		struct timespec now;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
