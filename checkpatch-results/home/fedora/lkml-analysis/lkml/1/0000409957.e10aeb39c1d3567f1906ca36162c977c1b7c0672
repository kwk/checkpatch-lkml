WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#99: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:320:
+	struct mem_container *mem;
+	if (!mm)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buf"
#152: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:395:
+	if (buf == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#166: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:404:
+	tmp = simple_strtoul(buf, &end, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#265: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:39:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
