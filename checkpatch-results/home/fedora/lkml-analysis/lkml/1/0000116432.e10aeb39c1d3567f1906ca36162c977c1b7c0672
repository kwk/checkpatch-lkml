CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'host->bus_ops != NULL'
#120: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:744:
+	if ((host->bus_ops != NULL) && host->bus_ops->detect && !host->bus_dead)

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "host->bus_ops"
#120: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:744:
+	if ((host->bus_ops != NULL) && host->bus_ops->detect && !host->bus_dead)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#125: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:749:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
