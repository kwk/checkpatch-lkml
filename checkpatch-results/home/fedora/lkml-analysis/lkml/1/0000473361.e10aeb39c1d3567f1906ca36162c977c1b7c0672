WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#92: FILE: drivers/char/pcmcia/ipwireless_cs_hardware.c:378:
+static char *data_type(const u_char * buf, unsigned length)

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#92: FILE: drivers/char/pcmcia/ipwireless_cs_hardware.c:378:
+static char *data_type(const u_char * buf, unsigned length)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
