WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#56: FILE: fs/jffs2/fs.c:702:
+	if (jffs2_ubivol(c)) {
+		jffs2_ubivol_cleanup(c);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'c' may be better as '(c)' to avoid precedence issues

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#91: FILE: fs/jffs2/wbuf.c:1278:
+int jffs2_ubivol_setup(struct jffs2_sb_info *c) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 121 exceeds 100 columns
#106: FILE: fs/jffs2/wbuf.c:1293:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "JFFS2 write-buffering enabled buffer (%d) erasesize (%d)\n", c->wbuf_pagesize, c->sector_size);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
