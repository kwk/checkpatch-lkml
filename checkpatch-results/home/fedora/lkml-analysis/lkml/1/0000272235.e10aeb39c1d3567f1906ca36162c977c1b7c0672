Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#91: FILE: drivers/mtd/devices/mtd_dataflash.c:556:
+static struct flash_info __devinitdata dataflash_data [] = {

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#92: FILE: drivers/mtd/devices/mtd_dataflash.c:557:
+static struct flash_info __devinitdata dataflash_data [] = {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
