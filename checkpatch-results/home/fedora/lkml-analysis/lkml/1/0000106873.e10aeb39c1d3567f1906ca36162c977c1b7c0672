CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#72: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:655:
+#define SAVED_CMDLINES			(1 << SAVED_CMDLINE_SHIFT)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#74: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:657:
+static unsigned map_cmdline_to_tick[SAVED_CMDLINES];

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#119: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:771:
+	hash = map = hash_32((u32)tsk->pid, SAVED_CMDLINE_SHIFT);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
