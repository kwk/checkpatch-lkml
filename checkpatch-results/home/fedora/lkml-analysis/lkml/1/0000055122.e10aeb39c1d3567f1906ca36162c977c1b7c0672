CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dn"
#84: FILE: fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c:66:
+	for (dn = dn_mark->dn; dn != NULL; dn = dn->dn_next)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#191: FILE: fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c:172:
+	BUG_ON(dn_mark->dn);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dn_mark->dn"
#245: FILE: fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c:228:
+	if (dn_mark->dn == NULL)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#394: FILE: fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c:403:
+	error = attach_dn(dn, dn_mark, id, fd, filp, mask);
