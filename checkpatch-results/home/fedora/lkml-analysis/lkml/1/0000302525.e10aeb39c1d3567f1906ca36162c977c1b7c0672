CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: include/asm-x86/smp.h:150:
+extern int safe_smp_processor_id(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces required around that ':' (ctx:VxV)
#70: FILE: include/asm-x86/smp.h:158:
+	__asm__("andq %%rsp,%0; ":"=r" (ti) : "0" (CURRENT_MASK));	\
 	                         ^
