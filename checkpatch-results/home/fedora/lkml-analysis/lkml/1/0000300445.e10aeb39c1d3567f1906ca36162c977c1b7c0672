#35: 
locking diffrent kinds of bluetooth sockets at the same time.
        ^^^^^^^^

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#115: FILE: net/bluetooth/af_bluetooth.c:128:
+	BUG_ON(sock_owned_by_user(sk));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
