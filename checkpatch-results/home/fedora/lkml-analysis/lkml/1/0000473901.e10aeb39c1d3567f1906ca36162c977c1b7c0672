CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#44: FILE: include/linux/lockdep.h:243:
+extern void lock_set_subclass(struct lockdep_map *lock, unsigned int subclass,

files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
