WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'childs' may be misspelled - perhaps 'children'?
#37: 
task childs. These values are used in k_getrusage() to actually fill
     ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#112: FILE: kernel/fork.c:853:
+	sig->maxrss = sig->cmaxrss = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
