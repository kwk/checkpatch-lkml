WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .7
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#62: FILE: arch/i386/lib/usercopy.c:728:
+		if (in_atomic())

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20080320201723.b87b3732.akpm@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#152: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:3335:
+	/* Blacklist entries taken from Silicon Image 3124/3132
+	   Windows driver .inf file - also several Linux problem reports */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#152: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:3335:

 		                               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#412: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/pluto2/pluto2.c:382:
 static int __devinit pluto_hw_init(struct pluto *pluto)

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#445: FILE: drivers/net/8139too.c:1616:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#532: FILE: drivers/net/ifb.c:116:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
