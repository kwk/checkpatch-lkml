> And shouldn't offset be called prev_offset?  Or should prev_page be called

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#104: FILE: mm/filemap.c:950:
+		prev_offset = ra.prev_offset = offset;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#194: FILE: mm/readahead.c:550:
+		ra->prev_index = min(ra->prev_index,
 			ra->ahead_start + ra->ahead_size - 1);
