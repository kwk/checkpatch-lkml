WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Non-standard signature: 'Ack-ed-by:' - perhaps 'Acked-by:'?
#84: 
Ack-ed-by: Jim Keniston <jkenisto@us.ibm.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#101: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/kprobes.c:172:
+	unsigned long addr = (unsigned long) p->addr;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#122: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/kprobes.c:193:

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#159: FILE: include/asm-i386/kprobes.h:98:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'address >= PFN_ALIGN(_text)'
#160: FILE: include/asm-i386/kprobes.h:99:
+	if (kernel_text_is_ro && ((address >= PFN_ALIGN(_text))
+				&& (address < PFN_ALIGN(_etext))))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'address < PFN_ALIGN(_etext)'
#160: FILE: include/asm-i386/kprobes.h:99:
+	if (kernel_text_is_ro && ((address >= PFN_ALIGN(_text))
+				&& (address < PFN_ALIGN(_etext))))

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#161: FILE: include/asm-i386/kprobes.h:100:
+	if (kernel_text_is_ro && ((address >= PFN_ALIGN(_text))
+				&& (address < PFN_ALIGN(_etext))))
