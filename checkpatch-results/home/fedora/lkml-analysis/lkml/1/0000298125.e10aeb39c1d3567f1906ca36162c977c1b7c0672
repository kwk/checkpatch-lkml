# HG changeset patch

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#468: FILE: mm/mmap.c:2270:
+	nr_i_mmap_sems = nr_anon_vma_locks = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#510: FILE: mm/mmap.c:2308:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#510: FILE: mm/mmap.c:2308:

+		i_mmap_sem = (struct rw_semaphore *) -1UL;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
