WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#50: FILE: fs/udf/inode.c:1160:
+	long convtime_usec;
+	if (udf_stamp_to_time(&convtime, &convtime_usec,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#51: FILE: fs/udf/inode.c:1161:
+	if (udf_stamp_to_time(&convtime, &convtime_usec,
+				lets_to_cpu(*tstamp))) {

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#54: FILE: fs/udf/inode.c:1164:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
