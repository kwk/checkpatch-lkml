WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#157: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1176:
+	BUG_ON(!blk_pc_request(cmd->request));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SCpnt>
#229: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:515:
+	SCpnt->done = sd_rw_intr;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#247: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:896:
+static void sd_rw_intr(struct scsi_cmnd * SCpnt)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#340: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_cmnd.h:37:
+	void (*done) (struct scsi_cmnd *);	/* Mid-level done function */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct scsi_cmnd *' should also have an identifier name
#340: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_cmnd.h:37:
+	void (*done) (struct scsi_cmnd *);	/* Mid-level done function */

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#348: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_cmnd.h:125:
+extern void scsi_io_completion(struct scsi_cmnd *, unsigned int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
