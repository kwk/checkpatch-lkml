WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#61: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#66: FILE: arch/xtensa/variants/s6000/delay.c:1:
+#include <asm/delay.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/delay.h> instead of <asm/delay.h>
#66: FILE: arch/xtensa/variants/s6000/delay.c:1:
+#include <asm/delay.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#68: FILE: arch/xtensa/variants/s6000/delay.c:3:

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#74: FILE: arch/xtensa/variants/s6000/delay.c:9:
+	u32 uninitialized_var(a);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'a' should also have an identifier name
#74: FILE: arch/xtensa/variants/s6000/delay.c:9:
+	u32 uninitialized_var(a);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#75: FILE: arch/xtensa/variants/s6000/delay.c:10:

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'u' should also have an identifier name

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#79: FILE: arch/xtensa/variants/s6000/delay.c:14:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
