Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#125: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/hpet.c:173:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#170: FILE: include/asm-i386/hpet.h:70:
+extern void hpet_disable_int(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
