ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#166: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:486:
=20

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#173: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:487:
+	BUG_ON(!list_empty(&ctx->list));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
