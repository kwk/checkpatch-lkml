CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:289:
+extern void handle_level_oneshot_irq(unsigned int irq, struct irq_desc *desc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
