CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#60: FILE: drivers/net/phy/mdio-bitbang.c:29:
+#define MDIO_C45 (1<<15)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#129: FILE: drivers/net/phy/mdio-bitbang.c:161:
+	if (reg & MII_ADDR_C45) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
