#34: 
  Device 'virtio-pci' does not have a release() function, it is broken and must be fixed

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*root)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct device)...)
#66: FILE: drivers/virtio/virtio_pci.c:88:
+	root = kzalloc(sizeof(struct device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!root"
#67: FILE: drivers/virtio/virtio_pci.c:89:
+	if (root == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
