ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#75: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:53:
+	if ((err = is_robranch_super(dentry->d_sb, 0))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#214: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:92:
+				printk("unionfs_create: could not unlink "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'unionfs_create', this function's name, in a string
#214: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:92:
+				printk("unionfs_create: could not unlink "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#215: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:93:
+				printk("unionfs_create: could not unlink "
+				       "whiteout, err = %d\n", err);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
