CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#84: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:3407:
+	if (nosetxfer && ap->flags & ATA_FLAG_SATA && ata_id_is_sata(dev->id))
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
