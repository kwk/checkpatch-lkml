With commit ef19454bd437b2ba, behavior of crc32c changes on

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#50: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/nes/nes.h:288:
+static inline u32 get_crc_value(struct nes_v4_quad* nes_quad)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
