CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#94: FILE: kernel/irq/internals.h:45:
+extern void irq_set_thread_affinity(struct irq_desc *desc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'affitnity' may be misspelled - perhaps 'affinity'?
#110: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:85:
+ *	@desc:		irq descriptor which has affitnity changed
   	      		                         ^^^^^^^^^
