CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kvmalloc(sizeof(*hdr)...) over kvmalloc(sizeof(struct ipc_rcu_hdr)...)
#137: FILE: ipc/util.c:495:
+	struct ipc_rcu_hdr *hdr = kvmalloc(sizeof(struct ipc_rcu_hdr) + size,

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#198: FILE: ipc/util.c:524:
+	struct ipc_rcu_hdr *hdr = container_of(ptr, struct ipc_rcu_hdr, data);
+	if (--hdr->refcount > 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
