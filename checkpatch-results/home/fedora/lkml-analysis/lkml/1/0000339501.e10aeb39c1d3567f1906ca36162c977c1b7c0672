Give a port 30ms to drain; this is an arbitary value chosen to avoid

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#62: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_core.c:1994:
+		for (tries = 3; !ops->tx_empty(port) && tries; tries--) {
 			msleep(10);
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
