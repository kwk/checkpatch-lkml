Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#64: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#120: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-buildid-cache.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:STATIC_CONST: Move const after static - use 'static const char'
#137: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-buildid-cache.c:18:
+static char const *add_name_list_str, *remove_name_list_str;

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#148: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-buildid-cache.c:29:
+	OPT_STRING('r', "remove", &remove_name_list_str, "file list",
+		    "file(s) to remove"),

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#261: FILE: tools/perf/builtin.h:19:
+extern int cmd_buildid_cache(int argc, const char **argv, const char *prefix);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!filename"
#354: FILE: tools/perf/util/header.c:296:
+	if (filename == NULL || linkname == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!linkname"
#354: FILE: tools/perf/util/header.c:296:
+	if (filename == NULL || linkname == NULL)
