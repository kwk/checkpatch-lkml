#26: 
When making changes to x86_64 timers, I noticed that touching hpet.h triggered

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/apic.h:89:
+extern int apic_is_clustered_box(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
