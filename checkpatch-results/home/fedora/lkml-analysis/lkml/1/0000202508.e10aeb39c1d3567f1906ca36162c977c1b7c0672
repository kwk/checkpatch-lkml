CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#119: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/setup.h:24:
+extern int wakeup_secondary_cpu_via_init(int apicid, unsigned long start_eip);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#262: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:618:
+int __devinit
