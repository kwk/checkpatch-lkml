CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/acpi.h:121:
+extern void acpi_reserve_wakeup_memory(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#110: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/acpi/sleep.c:139:
+	mem = find_e820_area(0, 1<<20, WAKEUP_SIZE, PAGE_SIZE);
 	                         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#119: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/acpi/sleep.c:145:
+	acpi_realmode = (unsigned long) phys_to_virt(mem);
