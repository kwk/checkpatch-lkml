CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#92: FILE: include/linux/time.h:133:
+extern s64 timekeeping_max_deferment(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
