WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#224: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:198:
+	ide_startstop_t (*callback) (ide_drive_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#587: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:983:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
