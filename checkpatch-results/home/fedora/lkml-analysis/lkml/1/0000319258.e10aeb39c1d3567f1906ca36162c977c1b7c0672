CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#155: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init_64.c:196:
+		if (vaddr < (unsigned long) _text || vaddr > end)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#269: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:149:
+static inline pgprot_t static_protections(pgprot_t prot, unsigned long address,
+				   unsigned long pfn)

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#372: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:528:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "CPA: called for zero pte. "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#373: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:529:

+		       "vaddr = %lx cpa->vaddr = %lx\n", address,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#459: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:608:
+		    PAGE_OFFSET + (max_pfn_mapped << PAGE_SHIFT))) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#461: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:610:
+		alias_cpa.vaddr = (unsigned long) __va(cpa->pfn << PAGE_SHIFT);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#476: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:622:
+	if (within(cpa->vaddr, (unsigned long) _text, (unsigned long) _end))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#586: FILE: include/asm-x86/pgtable_64.h:249:
+extern void cleanup_highmap(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
