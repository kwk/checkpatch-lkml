ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#101: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:828:
+	struct buffer_head * s_sbh;	/* Buffer containing the super block */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
