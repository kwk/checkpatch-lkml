Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#191: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1641:
+#define I_UNSTABLE_PAGES	(1 << __I_UNSTABLE_PAGES)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
