#373: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:359:
+	/* The console is magical, do not hang up the console hardware

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!port"
#374: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:360:
+	if (port == NULL || port->console)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
