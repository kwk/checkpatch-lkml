So let's move those initializations to top of function, thereby also shutting

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#63: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c:1779:
+	bufIn.len = bufOut.len = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bufIn>
#63: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c:1779:
+	bufIn.len = bufOut.len = 0;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bufOut>
