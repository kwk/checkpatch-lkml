CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'pfn' - possible side-effects?
#78: FILE: arch/xtensa/include/asm/page.h:158:
+#define pfn_valid(pfn)		((pfn) >= ARCH_PFN_OFFSET && ((pfn) - ARCH_PFN_OFFSET) < max_mapnr)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#108: FILE: arch/xtensa/mm/init.c:223:
+	max_mapnr = num_physpages = max_low_pfn - ARCH_PFN_OFFSET;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#109: FILE: arch/xtensa/mm/init.c:224:
+	high_memory = (void *) __va(max_low_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
