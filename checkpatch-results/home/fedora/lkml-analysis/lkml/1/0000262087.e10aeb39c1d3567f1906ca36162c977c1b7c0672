Subject: [RFC][PATCH 2/5] integrity: TPM internel kernel interface
                                         ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'chip_typ == TPM_ANY_TYPE'
#108: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:748:
+		if ((chip_num == TPM_ANY_NUM || pos->dev_num == chip_num)
+		    && (chip_typ == TPM_ANY_TYPE)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#109: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:749:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!chip"
#137: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:777:
+	if (chip == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#145: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:785:
+		rc = get_unaligned_be32((__be32 *) (data + 6));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#152: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:792:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
