it.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#220: FILE: kernel/sched.c:498:
+	cfs_b->quota = cfs_b->runtime = quota;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
