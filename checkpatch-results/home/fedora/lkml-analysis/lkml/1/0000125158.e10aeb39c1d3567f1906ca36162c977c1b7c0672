CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:142:
+extern void calc_global_load(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#147: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2987:
+	nr_active += (long) this_rq->nr_uninterruptible;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
