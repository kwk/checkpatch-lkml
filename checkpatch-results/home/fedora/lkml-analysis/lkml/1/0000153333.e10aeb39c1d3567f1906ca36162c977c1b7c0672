WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct perf_counter *' should also have an identifier name
#56: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:227:
+	void (*destroy)(struct perf_counter *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#82: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1737:
+	perf_swcounter_event(PERF_TP_EVENTS_MIN + event_id, 1, 1,
+			task_pt_regs(current));

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#86: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1741:
+extern void ftrace_profile_disable(int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
