The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#105: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-gru/grufile.c:66:
+static struct file_operations gru_fops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#475: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-gru/grufile.c:436:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
