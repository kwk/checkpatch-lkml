CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <FragmentThreshold>
#179: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/winbond/winbondport/mds.c:331:
+	FragmentThreshold = DEFAULT_FRAGMENT_THRESHOLD;	//Do not fragment

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#181: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/winbond/winbondport/mds.c:333:
+	memcpy( TargetBuffer, src_buffer, DOT_11_MAC_HEADER_SIZE );// Copy header

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited before that close parenthesis ')'
#181: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/winbond/winbondport/mds.c:333:

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <TargetBuffer>
#181: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/winbond/winbondport/mds.c:333:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#237: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/winbond/winbondport/mds.c:351:
+	ctmp1 = ctmpf = CURRENT_TX_RATE_FOR_MNG;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
