WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#134: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-5000.c:479:
+	 * index. We sort them here */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
