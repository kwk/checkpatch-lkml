WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#147: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:1200:
+	unsigned search_len = 0;

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#171: FILE: kernel/trace/ftrace.c:1224:
+	do_for_each_ftrace_rec(pg, rec) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
