#35: 
hfsplus_iget() then uses iget_locked() directly and returns a proper error code

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct super_block *' should also have an identifier name
#100: FILE: fs/hfsplus/hfsplus_fs.h:349:
+struct inode *hfsplus_iget(struct super_block *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#100: FILE: fs/hfsplus/hfsplus_fs.h:349:
+struct inode *hfsplus_iget(struct super_block *, unsigned long);

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#150: FILE: fs/hfsplus/super.c:86:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
