#31: 
Allow to limit the network bandwidth for specific process containers (cgroups)

#60: FILE: include/linux/cgroup_netlimit.h:1:
+#ifndef CGROUP_NETLIMIT_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: include/linux/cgroup_netlimit.h:22:
+extern void cgroup_nl_acct(int limit_id, size_t bytes);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#138: FILE: kernel/cgroup_netlimit.c:14:
+ * Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330,$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*nl)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct netlimit)...)
#195: FILE: kernel/cgroup_netlimit.c:71:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
