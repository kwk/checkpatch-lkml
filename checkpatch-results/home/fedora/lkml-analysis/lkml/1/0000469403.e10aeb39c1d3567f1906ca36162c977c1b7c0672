WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after command_line[COMMAND_LINE_SIZE]
#50: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/setup.c:125:
+static char __initdata command_line[COMMAND_LINE_SIZE] = "";

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
