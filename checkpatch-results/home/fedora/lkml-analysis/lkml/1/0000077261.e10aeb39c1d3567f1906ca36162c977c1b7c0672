CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#153: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:55:
+#define WS_USED (1 << WS_USED_B)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#343: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:163:
+		BUG_ON(!work->seen);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:MEMORY_BARRIER: memory barrier without comment

+static int pin_sb_for_writeback(struct writeback_control *wbc,
+				   struct inode *inode)

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#571: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:513:
+		 * umounted, drop rwsem again and fall through to failure

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#812: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:761:
+			work->sync_mode = sync_mode = WB_SYNC_ALL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#860: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:809:
+		if (pages_written)
[...]
+		else if (wait_jiffies != -1UL) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#957: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:906:
+			name = (const char *) dentry->d_name.name;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#1063: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:1012:

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#1361: FILE: include/linux/writeback.h:44:
+	struct super_block *sb;		/* if !NULL, only write inodes from
+					   this super_block */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting
