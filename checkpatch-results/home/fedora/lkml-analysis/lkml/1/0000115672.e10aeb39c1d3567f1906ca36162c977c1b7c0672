WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ur_pm_suspend', this function's name, in a string
#82: FILE: drivers/s390/char/vmur.c:175:
+	TRACE("ur_pm_suspend: cdev=%p\n", cdev);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#85: FILE: drivers/s390/char/vmur.c:178:
+		pr_err("Unit record device %s is busy, %s refusing to "
+		       "suspend.\n", dev_name(&cdev->dev), ur_banner);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
