ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#67: FILE: include/linux/klist.h:37:
(*get)(struct klist_node *),

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#237: FILE: lib/klist.c:305:
+	if (last) {
[...]
 	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
