WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#178: FILE: drivers/base/power/generic_ops.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#179: FILE: drivers/base/power/generic_ops.c:2:
+ * drivers/base/power/generic_ops.c - Generic PM callbacks for subsystems

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#204: FILE: drivers/base/power/generic_ops.c:27:
+		int ret = pm->runtime_idle(dev);
+		if (ret)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct device *' should also have an identifier name
#265: FILE: drivers/base/power/generic_ops.c:88:
+	int (*callback)(struct device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct device *' should also have an identifier name
#343: FILE: drivers/base/power/generic_ops.c:166:
+	int (*callback)(struct device *);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#395: FILE: drivers/base/power/generic_ops.c:218:
+struct dev_pm_ops generic_subsys_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
