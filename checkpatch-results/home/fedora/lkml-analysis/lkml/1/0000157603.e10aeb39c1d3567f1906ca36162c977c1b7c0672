Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

ERROR:DATE_TIME: Use of the '__DATE__' macro makes the build non-deterministic
#75: FILE: drivers/edac/amd8111_edac.c:36:
+#define AMD8111_EDAC_REVISION	" Ver: 1.0.0 " __DATE__

It is generally desirable that building the same source code with
the same set of tools is reproducible, i.e. the output is always
exactly the same.

The kernel does *not* use the ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros,
and enables warnings if they are used as they can lead to
non-deterministic builds.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#297: FILE: drivers/edac/amd8111_edac.c:258:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
