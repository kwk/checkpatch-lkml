#38: 
The pci_find_subsys gets called very early by obsolete ide setup parameters.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#76: FILE: drivers/pci/search.c:204:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pci_find_subsys', this function's name, in a string
#76: FILE: drivers/pci/search.c:204:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "pci_find_subsys() called while pci_devices "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#77: FILE: drivers/pci/search.c:205:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "pci_find_subsys() called while pci_devices "
+				"is still empty\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
