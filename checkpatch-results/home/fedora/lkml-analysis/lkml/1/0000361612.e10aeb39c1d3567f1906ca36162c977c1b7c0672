kobjects which create simple attributes need explicitely a ktype
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#97: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:317:
+	struct sysfs_ops *ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#109: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:325:
+	if (kobj->ktype && kobj->ktype->sysfs_ops)
[...]
-	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#120: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:327:
+	else {

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#121: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:328:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "missing sysfs attribute operations for "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#122: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:329:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "missing sysfs attribute operations for "
+		       "kobject: %s\n", kobject_name(kobj));

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
