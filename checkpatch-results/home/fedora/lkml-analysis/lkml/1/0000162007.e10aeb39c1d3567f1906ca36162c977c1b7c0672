WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'suppport' may be misspelled - perhaps 'support'?
#29: 
Add suppport for threaded interrupt handlers. This is a more strict
    ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#125: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:130:
+extern void exit_irq_thread(struct task_struct *tsk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#199: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:378:
+			     "IRQ %d requested to run threaded handler "
+			     "in hard interrupt context\n", irq);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#201: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:380:
+			/* Fall through and wake the thread */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#311: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:421:
+	param.sched_priority = MAX_USER_RT_PRIO/2;
 	                                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#318: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:428:
+		if (irq_thread_should_run(action) && current->irqaction) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#321: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:431:
