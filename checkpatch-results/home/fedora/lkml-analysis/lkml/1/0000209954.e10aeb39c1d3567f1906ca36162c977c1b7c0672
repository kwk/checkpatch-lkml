CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/linux/tracepoint.h:115:
+extern int tracepoint_probe_register_noupdate(const char *name, void *probe);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'call_rcu_sched', prefer 'call_rcu' instead
#128: FILE: kernel/tracepoint.c:86:
+		call_rcu_sched(&tp_probes->u.rcu, rcu_free_old_probes);

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.
