CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#529: FILE: drivers/ata/libata.h:102:
+extern int sata_down_spd_limit(struct ata_link *link, u32 spd_limit);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
