#32: 
Okay.  I've adjusted the desciption of the patch a little (see attached).
                         ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#82: FILE: fs/proc/task_nommu.c:126:
+	len = 25 + sizeof(void*) * 6 - len;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
