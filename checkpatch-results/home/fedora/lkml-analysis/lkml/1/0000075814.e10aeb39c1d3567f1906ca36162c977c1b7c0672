CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vaddr"
#80: FILE: arch/mips/mm/c-r4k.c:503:
+		if (unlikely(vaddr == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/cache.h> instead of <asm/cache.h>
#122: FILE: arch/mips/mm/init.c:34:
+#include <asm/cache.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
