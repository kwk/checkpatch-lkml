ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#50: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb3/iwch_cm.c:1790:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#66: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb3/iwch_cm.c:1806:
+		err = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
