WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#48: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_cs.c:887:
+	PCMCIA_DEVICE_CIS_PROD_ID12("ADVANTECH", "COMpad-32/85B-2", 0x96913a85, 0x27ab5437, "COMpad2.cis"),

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
