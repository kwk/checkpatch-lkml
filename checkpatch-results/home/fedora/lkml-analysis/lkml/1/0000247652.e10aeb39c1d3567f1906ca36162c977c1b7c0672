ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#67: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_console.c:152:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct hv_ops should normally be const
#69: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_console.c:154:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
