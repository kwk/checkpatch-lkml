WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 130 exceeds 100 columns
#66: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:1353:
+				if (page_address(bvec->bv_page) + PAGE_SIZE == page_address(bvprv->bv_page) && printk_ratelimit())

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
