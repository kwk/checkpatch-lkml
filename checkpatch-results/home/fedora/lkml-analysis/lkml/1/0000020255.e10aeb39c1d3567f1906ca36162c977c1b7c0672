#22: 
Subject: [PATCH 5/8] percpu: add __percpu sparse annotations to x86

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

+static struct cstate_entry __percpu *cpu_cstate_entry;	/* per CPU ptr */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
