CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#115: FILE: drivers/regulator/mc13783-regulator.c:85:
+#define MC13783_REG_POWERMISC_PWGT1SPIEN		(1 << 15)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct regulator_ops should normally be const
#127: FILE: drivers/regulator/mc13783-regulator.c:171:
+static struct regulator_ops mc13783_gpo_regulator_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#159: FILE: drivers/regulator/mc13783-regulator.c:458:
+int mc13783_powermisc_rmw(struct mc13783_regulator_priv *priv, u32 mask,
+									u32 val)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#165: FILE: drivers/regulator/mc13783-regulator.c:464:
+	BUG_ON(val & ~mask);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#243: FILE: drivers/regulator/mc13783-regulator.c:542:
+	 * where the meaning of bits is negated */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
