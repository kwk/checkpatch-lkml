[PATCH v4 1/2] Add function to convert between calendar time and broken-down time for universal use

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#83: FILE: include/linux/trace_clock.h:18:
+extern u64 notrace trace_clock_walltime(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
