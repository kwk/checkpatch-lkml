WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#429: FILE: kernel/trace/Kconfig:147:
+config BKL_TRACER
+	bool "Trace Big Kernel Lock latencies"
+	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
+	select TRACING
+	select STACKTRACE
+	help
+	  This tracer records the latencies issued by the Big Kernel Lock.
+	  It traces the time when a task requests the bkl, the time when it
+	  acquires it and the time when it releases it.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.
