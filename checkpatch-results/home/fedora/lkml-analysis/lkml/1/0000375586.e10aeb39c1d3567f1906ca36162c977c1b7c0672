                               ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "journal->j_dev_bd"
#56: FILE: fs/reiserfs/journal.c:2547:
+	if (journal->j_dev_bd != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'journal_init_dev', this function's name, in a string
#120: FILE: fs/reiserfs/journal.c:2615:
+		      "journal_init_dev: journal device: %s\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
