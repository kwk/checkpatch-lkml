WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#137: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:3111:

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#164: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_legacy.c:130:
+					give I/O port if non standard */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#212: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_via.c:104:
+	{ "cx700",	PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_CX700,    0x00, 0x2f, VIA_UDMA_133 | VIA_BAD_AST | VIA_SATA_PATA },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
