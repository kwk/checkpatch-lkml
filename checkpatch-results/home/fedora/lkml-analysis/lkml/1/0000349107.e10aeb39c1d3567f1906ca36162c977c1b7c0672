CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#133: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:204:
+	bu = lu = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#187: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:366:
 				printk(KERN_WARNING "PCI: region %s/%d "
+				       "too large: 0x%016llx-0x%016llx\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
