CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: include/linux/uaccess.h:109:
+extern int copy_strtok_from_user(void *to, const void __user *from,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#66: FILE: lib/uaccess.c:2:
+ * lib/uaccess.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'read'
#123: FILE: lib/uaccess.c:102:
+ *  len -= ret;  - 3 bytes was read
+ *  read = ret;

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'read'
#131: FILE: lib/uaccess.c:110:
+ *  len -= ret; - 5 bytes read
+ *  read += ret;
