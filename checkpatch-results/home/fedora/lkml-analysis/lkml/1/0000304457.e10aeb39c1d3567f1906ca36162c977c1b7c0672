Subject: [PATCH 106/148] include/asm-x86/rwsem.h: checkpatch cleanups - formatting only

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'name' - possible side-effects?
#62: FILE: include/asm-x86/rwsem.h:83:
+#define __RWSEM_INITIALIZER(name)				\
+{								\
+	RWSEM_UNLOCKED_VALUE, __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED((name).wait_lock), \

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#221: FILE: include/asm-x86/rwsem.h:208:
+		     /* tries to transition

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
