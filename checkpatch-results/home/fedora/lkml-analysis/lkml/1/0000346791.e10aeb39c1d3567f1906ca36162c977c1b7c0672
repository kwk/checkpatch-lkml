#29: 
Introduce queue_ accessors to set and clear queue_flags, which include debug

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#313: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:484:
+	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(q->queue_lock));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#313: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:484:
+	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(q->queue_lock));

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
