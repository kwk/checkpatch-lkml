WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#156: FILE: fs/ext4/extents.c:1209:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.

spaces are never used for indentation.

#588: FILE: include/linux/ext4_fs.h:985:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
