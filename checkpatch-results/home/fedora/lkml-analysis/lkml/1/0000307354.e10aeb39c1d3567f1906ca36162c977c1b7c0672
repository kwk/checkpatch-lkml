WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#135: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:1253:
+	BUG_ON(bio_get_endio(pkt->bio) != pkt_end_io_packet_write);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bio_get_endio"
#385: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1390:
+		if (bio_get_endio(wbio) == NULL ||

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#453: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1845:
+						if (bio_get_endio(bio) == NULL)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#590: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:118:
+^I^I^I        ? 0 : -EIO); // use bio_endio!$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Noone' may be misspelled - perhaps 'No one'?
#689: FILE: fs/bio.c:1014:

                                 ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <lbmIODone>
#780: FILE: fs/jfs/jfs_logmgr.c:2018:
+	bio_set_endio(bio, lbmIODone);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
