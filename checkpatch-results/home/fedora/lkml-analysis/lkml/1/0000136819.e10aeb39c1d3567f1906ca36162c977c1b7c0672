ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#86: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:115:
ticks, unsigned long nsec,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:119:
+extern unsigned long long clockevent_delta2ns(unsigned long latch,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#92: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:120:
+extern unsigned long long clockevent_delta2ns(unsigned long latch,
  					 struct clock_event_device *evt);

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#105: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1202:
  	printk(KERN_WARNING "hrtimer: interrupt too slow, "
+		"forcing clock min delta to %llu ns\n", dev->min_delta_ns);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#119: FILE: kernel/time/clockevents.c:39:
+unsigned long long clockevent_delta2ns(unsigned long latch,
  				  struct clock_event_device *evt)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#120: FILE: kernel/time/clockevents.c:40:
+unsigned long long clockevent_delta2ns(unsigned long latch,
  				  struct clock_event_device *evt)

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#123: FILE: kernel/time/clockevents.c:42:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
