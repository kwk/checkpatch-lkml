CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: include/linux/biotrack.h:16:
+extern int register_biocgroup_notifier(struct notifier_block *nb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
