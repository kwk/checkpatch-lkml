Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#174: FILE: drivers/industrialio/triggers/iio-trig-periodic-rtc.c:56:
+	ret = strict_strtoul(buf,10, &val);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'iio_trig_periodic_read_freq' to 'frequency_show' 'iio_trig_periodic_write_freq' to 'frequency_store'
#188: FILE: drivers/industrialio/triggers/iio-trig-periodic-rtc.c:70:
+}

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#190: FILE: drivers/industrialio/triggers/iio-trig-periodic-rtc.c:72:
+DEVICE_ATTR(frequency, S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
