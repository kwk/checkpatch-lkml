CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!desc->ld_s"
#200: FILE: tools/perf/util/probe-finder.c:320:
+			DIE_IF(desc->ld_s == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#418: FILE: tools/perf/util/util.h:145:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
