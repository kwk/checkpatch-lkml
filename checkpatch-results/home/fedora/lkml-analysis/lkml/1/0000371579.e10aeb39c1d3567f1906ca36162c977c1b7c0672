ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#121: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_sil.c:282:
problems, by limiting commands to 15 sectors (0=off, 1=on)");

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#122: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_sil.c:283:
+static int mod15_quirk = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#124: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_sil.c:285:
+MODULE_PARM_DESC(mod15_quirk, "Some disks from Seagate need a mod15 $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#152: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_sil.c:558:
+	 * of list, if we're not already there.
+	*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#213: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:648:
+	void (*fill_sg) (struct ata_queued_cmd *qc);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#221: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:797:
+extern void ata_fill_sg(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
