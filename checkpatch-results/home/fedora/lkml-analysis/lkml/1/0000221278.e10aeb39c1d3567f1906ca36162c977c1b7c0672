CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: include/linux/hugetlb.h:234:
+extern unsigned long vma_kernel_pagesize(struct vm_area_struct *vma);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#96: FILE: mm/hugetlb.c:223:
+ * cases this will be same size as used by the page table entries. $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
