WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#53: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#58: FILE: arch/arm/mach-w90x900/include/mach/nuc900_spi.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#59: FILE: arch/arm/mach-w90x900/include/mach/nuc900_spi.h:2:
+ * arch/arm/mach-w90x900/include/mach/nuc900_spi.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: arch/arm/mach-w90x900/include/mach/nuc900_spi.h:17:
+extern void mfp_set_groupg(struct device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#101: FILE: drivers/spi/Kconfig:247:
+config SPI_NUC900
+	tristate "Nuvoton NUC900 series SPI"

 #
 # Add new SPI master controllers in alphabetical order above this line
 #

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#138: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_nuc900.c:10:
+ *
+*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#244: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_nuc900.c:116:
+static void w90p910_spi_setup_txnum(struct w90p910_spi *hw,

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#257: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_nuc900.c:129:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
