CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#130: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tsc.c:324:
+		t1 = t2 = get_cycles();

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#137: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tsc.c:331:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
