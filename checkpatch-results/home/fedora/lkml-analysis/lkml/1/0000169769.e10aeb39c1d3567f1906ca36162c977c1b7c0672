CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#112: FILE: include/linux/async.h:40:
+extern async_cookie_t async_schedule_prealloc(struct async_entry *entry);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*entry)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct async_entry)...)
#205: FILE: kernel/async.c:203:
+	entry = kzalloc(sizeof(struct async_entry), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
