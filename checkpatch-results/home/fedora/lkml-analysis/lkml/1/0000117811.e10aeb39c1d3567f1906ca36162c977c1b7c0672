Subject: [PATCH] heci: fix spinlock order mess of device_lock and read_io_lock.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'orginal' may be misspelled - perhaps 'original'?
#45: 
In orginal code, the device_lock and read_io_lock is mess order when nested,
   ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#78: FILE: drivers/staging/heci/io_heci.c:640:
+	if (file_ext->state != HECI_FILE_CONNECTED) {
 		return -ENODEV;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
