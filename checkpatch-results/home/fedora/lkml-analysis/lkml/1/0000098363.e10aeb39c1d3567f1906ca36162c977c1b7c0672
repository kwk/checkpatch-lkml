CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#71: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/pl2303.c:997:
+		int i;
+		for (i = 0; i < urb->actual_length; ++i)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
