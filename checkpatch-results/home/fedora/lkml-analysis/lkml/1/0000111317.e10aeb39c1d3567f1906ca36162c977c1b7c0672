The following changes since commit 8ebf975608aaebd7feb33d77f07ba21a6380e086:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/tlbflush.h:175:
+extern void zap_low_mappings(bool early);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#152: FILE: include/linux/page_cgroup.h:26:
+}
+extern void __init page_cgroup_init(void);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#321: FILE: mm/page_cgroup.c:60:
+	base = __alloc_bootmem_node_nopanic(NODE_DATA(nid),
+			table_size, PAGE_SIZE, __pa(MAX_DMA_ADDRESS));

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#353: FILE: mm/page_cgroup.c:118:
+		base = kmalloc_node(table_size,
+				GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NOWARN, nid);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#425: FILE: mm/slab.c:1654:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
