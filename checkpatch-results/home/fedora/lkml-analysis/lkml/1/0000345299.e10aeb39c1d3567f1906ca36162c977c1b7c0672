#30: 
Move the temporary buffer used by some sdio functions from sdio_func struct to

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#77: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/sdio_io.c:404:
+	return le16_to_cpu(*(u16*)tmpbuf);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
