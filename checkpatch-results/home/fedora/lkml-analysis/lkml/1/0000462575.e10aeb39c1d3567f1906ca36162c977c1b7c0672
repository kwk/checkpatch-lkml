CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#81: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:796:
+	if (size <= pos)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#85: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:800:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#110: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:825:
+		data->req = req = fuse_get_req_wp(inode, wbc, &blocked);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
