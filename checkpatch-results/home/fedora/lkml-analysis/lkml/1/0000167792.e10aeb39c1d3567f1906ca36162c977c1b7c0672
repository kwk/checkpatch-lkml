The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#140: FILE: drivers/pci/dmar.c:886:
+		BUG_ON(addr & ((1 << (VTD_PAGE_SHIFT + mask)) - 1));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#166: FILE: include/linux/intel-iommu.h:199:

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#198: FILE: include/linux/intel-iommu.h:342:
+extern int qi_flush_dev_iotlb(struct intel_iommu *iommu, u16 sid, u16 qdep,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
