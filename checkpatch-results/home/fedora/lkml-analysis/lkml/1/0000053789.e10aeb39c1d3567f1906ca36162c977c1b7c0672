CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#150: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:282:
+		if (len < res)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#152: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:284:
+		else {

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#158: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:289:
+						 buffer+res, len, 0);
 						       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
