CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#125: FILE: drivers/ata/ahci.c:1139:
+					udelay(100);

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/timers/timers-howto.html#delays-information-on-the-various-kernel-delay-sleep-mechanisms

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#1279: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_mv.c:3526:
+	port->altstatus_addr = port->ctl_addr = shd_base + SHD_CTL_AST;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
