WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#100: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#105: FILE: kernel/rtmutex_adaptive.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#123: FILE: kernel/rtmutex_adaptive.c:19:
+unsigned long rtlock_loops   __read_mostly = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#130: FILE: kernel/rtmutex_adaptive.c:26:
+	rtlock_loops = ((u64) loops_per_jiffy * rtlock_timeout * HZ) >> 30;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#149: FILE: kernel/rtmutex_adaptive.c:45:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#194: FILE: kernel/rtmutex_adaptive.h:96:
+extern int proc_adaptive_timeout(struct ctl_table *table, int write,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#195: FILE: kernel/rtmutex_adaptive.h:97:
+extern int proc_adaptive_timeout(struct ctl_table *table, int write,
