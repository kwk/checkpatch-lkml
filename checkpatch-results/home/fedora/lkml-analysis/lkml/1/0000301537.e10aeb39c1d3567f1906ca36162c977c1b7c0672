#35: 
another weekend, another patch. This should apply on top of my previous patch

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#304: FILE: arch/x86/mm/kmmio.c:210:
+			pr_debug("kmmio: duplicate probe hit on CPU %d, for "
+						"address 0x%08lx.\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#320: FILE: arch/x86/mm/kmmio.c:224:
+		pr_emerg("kmmio: previous hit was at 0x%08lx.\n",
+					ctx->addr);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#348: FILE: arch/x86/mm/kmmio.c:277:
+		pr_debug("kmmio: spurious debug trap on CPU %d.\n",
+							smp_processor_id());

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#373: FILE: arch/x86/mm/kmmio.c:495:
+	int i;
+	for (i = 0; i < KMMIO_PAGE_TABLE_SIZE; i++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
