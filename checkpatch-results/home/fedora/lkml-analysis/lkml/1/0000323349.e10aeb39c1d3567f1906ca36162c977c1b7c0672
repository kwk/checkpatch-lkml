WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#18: 
Subject: Re: bug in checkpatch (on pointers to typedefs?)

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#62: FILE: f.c:1:
+void foo(int a, my_uint32 *);

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#62: FILE: f.c:1:
+void foo(int a, my_uint32 *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'my_uint32 *' should also have an identifier name
#62: FILE: f.c:1:
+void foo(int a, my_uint32 *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#63: FILE: f.c:2:
+int bar(int a, my_uint32_t *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'my_uint32_t *' should also have an identifier name
#63: FILE: f.c:2:
+int bar(int a, my_uint32_t *);
