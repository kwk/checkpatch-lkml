CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#51: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:630:
+	*ubd_dev = ((struct ubd) DEFAULT_UBD);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#109: FILE: arch/um/drivers/net_kern.c:350:
+	if(lp->remove != NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "lp->remove"
#109: FILE: arch/um/drivers/net_kern.c:350:
+	if(lp->remove != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
