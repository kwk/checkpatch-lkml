commit c2ec175c39f62949438354f603f4aa170846aabb upstream.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#182: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1100:
+extern int ext4_page_mkwrite(struct vm_area_struct *vma, struct vm_fault *vmf);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#350: FILE: include/linux/buffer_head.h:227:
+int block_page_mkwrite(struct vm_area_struct *vma, struct vm_fault *vmf,
 				get_block_t get_block);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#384: FILE: mm/memory.c:1949:
+			vmf.flags = FAULT_FLAG_WRITE|FAULT_FLAG_MKWRITE;
