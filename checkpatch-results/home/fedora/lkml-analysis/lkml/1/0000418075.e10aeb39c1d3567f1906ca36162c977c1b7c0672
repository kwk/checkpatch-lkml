WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#90: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/Kconfig:278:
+config JOYSTICK_XPAD_LEDS
+	bool "LED Support for Xbox360 controller 'BigX' LED"
+	depends on LEDS_CLASS && JOYSTICK_XPAD
+	---help---
+	  This option enables support for the LED which surrounds the Big X on
+	  XBox 360 controller.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: struct mutex definition without comment
#111: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/xpad.c:198:
+	struct mutex odata_mutex;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#219: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/xpad.c:446:
+		__u16 weak = effect->u.rumble.weak_magnitude;
+		xpad->odata[0] = 0x00;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#285: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/xpad.c:512:
+	xpad->led = led = kzalloc(sizeof(struct xpad_led), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*led)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct xpad_led)...)
#285: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/xpad.c:512:
+	xpad->led = led = kzalloc(sizeof(struct xpad_led), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
