Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct request_queue *' should also have an identifier name
#306: FILE: block/blk.h:15:
+	ssize_t (*show)(struct request_queue *, char *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char *' should also have an identifier name
#306: FILE: block/blk.h:15:

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct request_queue *' should also have an identifier name
#307: FILE: block/blk.h:16:

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const char *' should also have an identifier name
#307: FILE: block/blk.h:16:

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'size_t' should also have an identifier name

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#569: FILE: fs/sysfs/symlink.c:120:
+	BUG_ON(!kobj || !target);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_KERN_LEVEL: Possible unnecessary KERN_WARNING
#573: FILE: fs/sysfs/symlink.c:124:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

+		     "kobject '%s'\n", group, kobject_name(target));

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
