#32: 
Found a OOPS on a big SMP box during an overnight reboot test with upstream git.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#182: FILE: kernel/smp.c:231:
+		if (wait) {
 			data->flags = CSD_FLAG_WAIT;
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
