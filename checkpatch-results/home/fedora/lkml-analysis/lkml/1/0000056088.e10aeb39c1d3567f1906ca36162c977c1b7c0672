Subject: [PATCH 6/9] ser_gigaset: checkpatch cleanup

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*cb)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct cmdbuf_t)...)
#89: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/ser-gigaset.c:259:
+	cb = kmalloc(sizeof(struct cmdbuf_t) + len, GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*scs)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ser_cardstate)...)
#109: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/ser-gigaset.c:417:
+	scs = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ser_cardstate), GFP_KERNEL);

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ser' may be misspelled - perhaps 'set'?
#114: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/ser-gigaset.c:422:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
