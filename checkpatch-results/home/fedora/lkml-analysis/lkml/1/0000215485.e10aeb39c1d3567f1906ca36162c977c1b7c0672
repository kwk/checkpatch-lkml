next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#273: FILE: checkpoint/cpt_process.c:41:
+		
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
