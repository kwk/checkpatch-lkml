WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#74: FILE: ipc/syscall.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#110: FILE: ipc/syscall.c:37:
+		union semun fourth;
+		if (!ptr)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#118: FILE: ipc/syscall.c:45:
+		return sys_msgsnd(first, (struct msgbuf __user *) ptr,

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#169: FILE: ipc/syscall.c:96:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
