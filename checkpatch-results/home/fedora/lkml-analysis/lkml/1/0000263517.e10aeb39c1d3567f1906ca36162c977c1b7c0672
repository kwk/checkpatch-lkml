WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#97: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:198:
+extern void native_usergs_sysret(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while loop
#140: FILE: include/asm-x86/irqflags.h:171:
+#define USERGS_SYSRET					\
 			swapgs;				\
 			sysretq;

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#140: FILE: include/asm-x86/irqflags.h:171:
+#define USERGS_SYSRET					\
 			swapgs;				\
 			sysretq;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
