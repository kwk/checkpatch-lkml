Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#130: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c:25:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

+		if (nd->pci_bus) {

+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
