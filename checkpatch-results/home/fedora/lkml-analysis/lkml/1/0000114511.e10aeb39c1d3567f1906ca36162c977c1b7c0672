CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#109: FILE: scripts/unifdef.c:709:
+		if (sym >= 0)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "value[sym]"
#110: FILE: scripts/unifdef.c:710:
+			*valp = (value[sym] != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#111: FILE: scripts/unifdef.c:711:
+		else {

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#113: FILE: scripts/unifdef.c:713:
+			return (LT_IF);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Linetype>
#122: FILE: scripts/unifdef.c:749:
+	Linetype lhs, rhs;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#128: FILE: scripts/unifdef.c:753:
+	lhs = ops->inner(ops+1, valp, &cp);
 	                    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
