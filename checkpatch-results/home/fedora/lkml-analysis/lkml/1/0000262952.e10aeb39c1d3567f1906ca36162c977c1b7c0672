I'm attached updated patch, in order to pass 'checkpatch.pl' tool process smoothly.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
