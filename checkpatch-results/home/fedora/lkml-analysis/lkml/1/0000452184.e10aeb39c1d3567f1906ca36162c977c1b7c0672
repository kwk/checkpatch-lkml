Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#88: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:127:
+	switch (code) {
+		case ABS_X:
[...]
+		case ABS_Y:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }
