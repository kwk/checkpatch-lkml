Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the

as the last construct.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
