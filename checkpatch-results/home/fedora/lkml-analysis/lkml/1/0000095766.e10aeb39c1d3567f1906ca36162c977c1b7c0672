CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#82: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/drm_irq.c:184:
+	if (state)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#145: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_reg.h:33:
+#define INTEL_GMCH_VGA_DISABLE  (1 << 1)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#182: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_drv.h:157:
+extern int intel_modeset_vga_disable(struct drm_device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#194: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/r100.c:1261:
+	uint32_t temp;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#195: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/r100.c:1262:
+	uint32_t temp;
+	temp = RREG32(RADEON_CONFIG_CNTL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#196: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/r100.c:1263:
+	temp &= ~(1<<8);
 	           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
