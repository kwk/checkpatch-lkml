WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#84: FILE: fs/super.c:551:
+		if (retval < 0 && retval != -ENOSYS)

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
