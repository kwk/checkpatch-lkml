Commit bd753921015e7905 ("perf_counter: software counter event

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#158: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/perf_counter.h:87:
+#define set_perf_counter_pending()	\
+		set_tsk_thread_flag(current, TIF_PERF_COUNTERS);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
