CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#303: FILE: fs/bio.c:245:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#329: FILE: fs/bio.c:1057:

+	bio_put(bio);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#406: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:283:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
