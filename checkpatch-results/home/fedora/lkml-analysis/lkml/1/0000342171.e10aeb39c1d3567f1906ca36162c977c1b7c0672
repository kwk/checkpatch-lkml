WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#42: FILE: arch/cris/arch-v10/boot/compressed/Makefile:2:
+# arch/cris/arch-v10/boot/compressed/Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_VARIABLE: Use of EXTRA_CFLAGS is deprecated, please use `ccflags-y instead.
#49: FILE: arch/cris/arch-v10/boot/compressed/Makefile:6:
+EXTRA_CFLAGS = -O2

EXTRA_{A,C,CPP,LD}FLAGS are deprecated and should be replaced by the new
flags added via commit f77bf01425b1 ("kbuild: introduce ccflags-y,
asflags-y and ldflags-y").

The following conversion scheme maybe used::

  EXTRA_AFLAGS    ->  asflags-y
  EXTRA_CFLAGS    ->  ccflags-y
  EXTRA_CPPFLAGS  ->  cppflags-y
  EXTRA_LDFLAGS   ->  ldflags-y
