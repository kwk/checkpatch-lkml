CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#181: FILE: include/linux/input.h:1363:
+extern void input_dbg_clear_keys(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'avaialble' may be misspelled - perhaps 'available'?
#291: FILE: drivers/input/input.c:1735:
+	/* Schedule a tasklet unless all locks are avaialble */
 	                                           ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#293: FILE: drivers/input/input.c:1737:
+		if (spin_is_locked(&dev->event_lock)) {

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
