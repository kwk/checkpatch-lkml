WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#54: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_cmd64x.c:224:
+	if (adev->dma_mode >= XFER_UDMA_0) {
[...]
+			regU |= 4 << adev->devno;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
