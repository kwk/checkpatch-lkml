WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#168: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:744:
+static void change_legacy_io_resource(struct pci_dev * dev, unsigned index,

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#168: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:744:
+static void change_legacy_io_resource(struct pci_dev * dev, unsigned index,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
