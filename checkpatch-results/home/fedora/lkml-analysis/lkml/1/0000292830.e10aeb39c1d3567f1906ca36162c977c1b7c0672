#75: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/locomokbd.c:49:

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#137: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/locomokbd.c:160:
+			 * if it was pressed for more than a second. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#138: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/locomokbd.c:161:
+			if (unlikely(key == KEY_ESC)) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
