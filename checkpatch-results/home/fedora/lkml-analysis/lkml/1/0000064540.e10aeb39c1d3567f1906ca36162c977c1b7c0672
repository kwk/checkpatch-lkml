CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#63: FILE: fs/aio.c:67:
+#define AIO_BATCH_HASH_SIZE	(1 << AIO_BATCH_HASH_BITS)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#68: FILE: fs/aio.c:72:
+};
+mempool_t *abe_pool;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#78: FILE: fs/aio.c:88:
+	BUG_ON(!abe_pool);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
