CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#657: FILE: mm/backing-dev.c:558:
+	bdi->wb_mask = bdi->wb_active = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
