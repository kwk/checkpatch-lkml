#201: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/smp-cmp.c:57:
+		unsigned int i;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#382: FILE: arch/mips/include/asm/smp.h:61:
+extern void arch_send_call_function_ipi_mask(const struct cpumask *mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
