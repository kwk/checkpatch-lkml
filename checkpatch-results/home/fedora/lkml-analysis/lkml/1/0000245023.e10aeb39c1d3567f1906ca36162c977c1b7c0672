#36: 
This is a preparation patch for introducing a generic iommu_num_pages function.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#55: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.c:185:
+	unsigned pages = iommu_nr_pages(address, size);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#155: FILE: include/asm-x86/iommu.h:10:
+extern unsigned long iommu_nr_pages(unsigned long addr, unsigned long len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
