WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#57: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 2
#96: FILE: Documentation/pps/ppsfind:2:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#147: FILE: Documentation/pps/ppstest.c:30:
+		fprintf(stderr, "cannot create a PPS source from device "
+				"\"%s\" (%m)\n", path);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#168: FILE: Documentation/pps/ppstest.c:51:
+	 * propagation delay */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#199: FILE: Documentation/pps/ppstest.c:82:
+		ret = time_pps_fetch(*handle, PPS_TSFMT_TSPEC, &infobuf,
+				   &timeout);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#200: FILE: Documentation/pps/ppstest.c:83:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'usage', this function's name, in a string
#230: FILE: Documentation/pps/ppstest.c:113:
+	fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <ppsdev> [<ppsdev> ...]\n", name);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
