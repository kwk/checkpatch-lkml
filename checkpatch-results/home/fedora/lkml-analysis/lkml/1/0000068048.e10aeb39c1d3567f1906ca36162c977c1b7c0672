Subject: [PATCH] timer: provide microaccounting for iowait in addition to idle time

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/tick.h:124:
+extern u64 get_cpu_iowait_time_us(int cpu, u64 *last_update_time);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
