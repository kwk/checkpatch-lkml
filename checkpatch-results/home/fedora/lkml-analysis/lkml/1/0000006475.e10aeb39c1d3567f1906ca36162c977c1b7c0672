Subject: [PATCH 32/66] arch/parisc/include/asm/parport.h: Checkpatch cleanup

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
