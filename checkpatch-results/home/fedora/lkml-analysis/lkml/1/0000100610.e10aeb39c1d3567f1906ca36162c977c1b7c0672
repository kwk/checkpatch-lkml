CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "inode->i_cdev"
#83: FILE: fs/file_table.c:284:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.
