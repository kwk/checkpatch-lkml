#36: 
A vcpu_down request from the remote admin via Xenbus both hotunplugs the CPU, and disables it by removing it from the cpu_present map, and removing its entry in /sys

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#120: FILE: arch/x86/xen/smp.c:338:
+	unsigned int cpu = smp_processor_id();
+	if (cpu == 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#198: FILE: arch/x86/xen/time.c:456:

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#198: FILE: arch/x86/xen/time.c:456:
+	BUG_ON(cpu == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
