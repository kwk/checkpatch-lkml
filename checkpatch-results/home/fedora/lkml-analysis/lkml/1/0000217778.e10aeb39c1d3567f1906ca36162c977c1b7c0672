#30: 
Copy the simplification from the pty unix98 special case to the generic one.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*tp)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ktermios[2])...)
#64: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1243:
+		tp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ktermios[2]), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tp"
#65: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1244:
+		if (tp == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
