WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#30: 
#ifdef __KERNEL__

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct cpuinfo_x86 *' should also have an identifier name
#84: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpu.h:20:
+	void            (*c_early_init)(struct cpuinfo_x86 *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
