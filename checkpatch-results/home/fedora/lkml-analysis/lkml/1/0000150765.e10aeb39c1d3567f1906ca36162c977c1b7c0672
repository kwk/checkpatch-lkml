CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#140: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:378:
+extern void perf_counter_update_userpage(struct perf_counter *counter);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#166: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:1356:
+	userpg = (struct perf_counter_mmap_page *) counter->user_page;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const

+static struct vm_operations_struct perf_mmap_vmops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
