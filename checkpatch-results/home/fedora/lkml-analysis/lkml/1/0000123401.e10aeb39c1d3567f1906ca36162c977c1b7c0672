ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#211: FILE: lib/ext2fs/ext2_fs.h:642:
#define EXT4_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_MMP		0x0100

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxE)

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#263: FILE: misc/tune2fs.8.in:455:
+++ b/misc/tune2fs.8.in

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#343: FILE: misc/tune2fs.c:364:
+			fputs(_("The whiteout flag may only be "
+				"cleared when the filesystem is\n"

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
