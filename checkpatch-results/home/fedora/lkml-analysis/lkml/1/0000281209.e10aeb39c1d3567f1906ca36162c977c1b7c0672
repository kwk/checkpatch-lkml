WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#76: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#81: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/ftrace.c:1:
+#include <linux/spinlock.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#92: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/ftrace.c:12:
+	u32 insn = *(u32 *) ip;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#110: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/ftrace.c:30:
+	return (unsigned char *) &call;

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('
#122: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/ftrace.c:42:
+	__asm__ __volatile__(

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#174: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/ftrace.c:94:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
