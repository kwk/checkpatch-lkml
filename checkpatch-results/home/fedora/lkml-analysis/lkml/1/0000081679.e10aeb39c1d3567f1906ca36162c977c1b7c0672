WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#46: FILE: arch/x86/Kconfig:1485:
+config KEXEC_AUTO_RESERVE
+	bool "automatically reserve memory for kexec kernel"
+	depends on KEXEC
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  Automatically reserve memory for a kexec kernel, so that you don't
+	  need to specify numbers for the "crashkernel=X@Y" boot option,
+	  instead you can use "crashkernel=auto". To make this work, you need
+	  to have more than 4G memory.
+
+	  On x86_32, 128M is reserved, on x86_64 1/32 of your memory is
+	  reserved, but it will not exceed 1T/32.
+
 config CRASH_DUMP
 	bool "kernel crash dumps"

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
