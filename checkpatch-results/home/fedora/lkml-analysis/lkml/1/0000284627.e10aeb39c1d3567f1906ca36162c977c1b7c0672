CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#231: FILE: fs/utimes.c:173:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!filename"
#256: FILE: fs/utimes.c:198:
+	if (filename == NULL && dfd != AT_FDCWD) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#316: FILE: include/linux/time.h:112:
+extern int do_utimes(int dfd, char __user *filename, struct timespec *times,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
