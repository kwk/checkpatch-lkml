Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

+dump_user_backtrace32(struct frame_head * head)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#75: FILE: arch/x86/oprofile/backtrace.c:80:
+	 * (towards higher addresses) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
