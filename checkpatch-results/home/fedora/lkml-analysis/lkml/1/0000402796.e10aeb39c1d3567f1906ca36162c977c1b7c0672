(commit e3bbb3f05339de438faf54124f25c92e6fe4ac2e) I noticed that the 

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!crp"
#127: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/cr_bllcd.c:213:
+	if (crp == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
