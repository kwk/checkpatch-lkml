Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#103: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drmP.h:859:
+extern int drm_mem_proc_show(struct seq_file *m, void *v);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#138: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drm_memory_debug.h:94:
+static int drm__mem_info (struct seq_file *m) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#236: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drm_proc.c:101:
+					S_IFREG | S_IRUGO, minor->dev_root,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
