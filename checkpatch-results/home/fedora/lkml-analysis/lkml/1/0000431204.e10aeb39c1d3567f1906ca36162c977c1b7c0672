WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#271: FILE: include/linux/exportfs.h:1:
+#ifndef LINUX_EXPORTFS_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#385: FILE: include/linux/exportfs.h:115:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
