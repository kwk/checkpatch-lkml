+extern void pci_acs_init(struct pci_dev *dev);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#119: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:205:
+extern void pci_acs_init(struct pci_dev *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
