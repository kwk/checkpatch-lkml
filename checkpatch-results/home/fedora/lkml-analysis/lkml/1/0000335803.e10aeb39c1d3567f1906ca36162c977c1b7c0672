Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#54: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr_32.c:245:
+			BUG_ON(pte && !pte_none(*pte));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
