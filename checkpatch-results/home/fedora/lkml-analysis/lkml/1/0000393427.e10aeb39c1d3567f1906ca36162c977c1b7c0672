CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#1334: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1193:
+	ska->sk_peercred.pid = skb->sk_peercred.pid = task_tgid_vnr(current);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
