#29: 
when running linux as XEN guest and use boot parameter mem= to set memory lower then is assigned to guest, not used memory should be returned to hypervisor as free. This is working with kernel available on xen.org pages, but is not working with kernel 2.6.29. Comparing both kernels I found code for returning unused memory to hypervisor is missing. Following patch add this functionality to 2.6.29 kernel.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line

Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
