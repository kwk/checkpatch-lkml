Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!first_dso"
#97: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:529:
+		if (first_dso == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#98: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:530:
+			unique_dso = first_dso = syme->map->dso;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#111: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:543:
+	if (unique_dso)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#113: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:545:
+	else {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#115: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:547:
+		int max_dso_width = winsize.ws_col - sym_width - 29;
+		if (dso_width > max_dso_width)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
