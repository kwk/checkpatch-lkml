Subject: [PATCH] NET: tg3: fix brace, switch, and comma spacing coding style in tg3.c This is a patch to the tg3.c file that aligns switch and case statements, else statements following braces, and inserts a space after commas listed in the coding style guidelines and verified by checkpatch.pl tool.

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#157: FILE: drivers/net/tg3.c:4170:
+			} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
