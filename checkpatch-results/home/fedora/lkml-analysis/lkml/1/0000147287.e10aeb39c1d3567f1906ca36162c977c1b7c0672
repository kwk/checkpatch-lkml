 This patch is a simple s/p_s_tb/tb/g to the reiserfs code. This is the fourth

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#306: FILE: fs/reiserfs/fix_node.c:1116:
+		if ((n_ret_value = get_far_parent(tb, n_h + 1, &p_s_curf,

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'tb->rnum[i]'
#605: FILE: fs/reiserfs/fix_node.c:2221:
+			if (!locked && (tb->rnum[i])) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#855: FILE: fs/reiserfs/fix_node.c:2428:
+		 * invalid and needs to be redone. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const void *' should also have an identifier name
#1060: FILE: include/linux/reiserfs_fs.h:2007:
+int fix_nodes(int n_op_mode, struct tree_balance *tb,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
