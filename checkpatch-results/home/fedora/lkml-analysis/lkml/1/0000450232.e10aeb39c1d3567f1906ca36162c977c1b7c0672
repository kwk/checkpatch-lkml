WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#82: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c:1909:
+static struct vm_operations_struct kvm_vcpu_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
