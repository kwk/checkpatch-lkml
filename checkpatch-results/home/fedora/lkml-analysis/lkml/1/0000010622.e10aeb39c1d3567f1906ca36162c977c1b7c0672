CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#56: FILE: include/linux/rtnetlink.h:739:
+extern int lockdep_rtnl_is_held(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#173: FILE: net/decnet/dn_route.c:1621:
+		for(rt = rcu_dereference_bh(dn_rt_hash_table[h].chain), idx = 0;
