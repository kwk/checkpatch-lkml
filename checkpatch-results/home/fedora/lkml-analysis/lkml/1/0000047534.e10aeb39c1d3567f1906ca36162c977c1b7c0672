#26: 
- Change returned handle_invalid_guest_state() to return relevant exit codes

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#123: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c:3608:
+	/* Don't enter VMX if guest state is invalid, let the exit handler
+	   start emulation until we arrive back to a valid state */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
