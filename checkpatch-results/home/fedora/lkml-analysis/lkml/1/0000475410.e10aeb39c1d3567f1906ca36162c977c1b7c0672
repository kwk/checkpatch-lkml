WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#37: FILE: drivers/atm/horizon.c:1848:
+static int __devinit hrz_init (hrz_dev * dev) {

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#37: FILE: drivers/atm/horizon.c:1848:
+static int __devinit hrz_init (hrz_dev * dev) {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#37: FILE: drivers/atm/horizon.c:1848:
+static int __devinit hrz_init (hrz_dev * dev) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#37: FILE: drivers/atm/horizon.c:1848:
+static int __devinit hrz_init (hrz_dev * dev) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
