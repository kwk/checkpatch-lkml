Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Staging: cx25821 fixed C99 comments, white spaces and unnecessary braces This patch fixes some C99 style comments, trailing white spaces and some unnecessary 'if' braces found by checkpatch.pl Signed-off-by: Wouter Van Rooy <wouter.vanrooy@gmail.com>

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros starting with if should be enclosed by a do - while loop to avoid possible if/else logic defects

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

  */
