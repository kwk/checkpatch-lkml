description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/ptrace.h:111:
+extern void user_enable_single_step(struct task_struct *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/ptrace.h:112:
+extern void user_disable_single_step(struct task_struct *child);

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
#83: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/ptrace.h:125:

+	(struct pt_regs *) \

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#92: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#97: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/syscall.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#147: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/syscall.h:51:
+                         int error, long val)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#157: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/syscall.h:61:
+	BUG_ON(i);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#160: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/syscall.h:64:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
