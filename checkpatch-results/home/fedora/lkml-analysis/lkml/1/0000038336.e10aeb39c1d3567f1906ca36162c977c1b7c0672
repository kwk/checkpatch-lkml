CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#53: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_ksym.c:240:
+		ret = trace_seq_printf(s, "%pS:",
+				(void *)(unsigned long)entry->attr.bp_addr);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#89: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_ksym.c:311:
+	ret = op = parse_ksym_trace_str(buf, &ksymname, &ksym_addr);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
