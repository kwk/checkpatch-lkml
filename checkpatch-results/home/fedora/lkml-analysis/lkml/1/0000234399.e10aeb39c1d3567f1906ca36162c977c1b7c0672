CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#107: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:114:
+extern struct resource *check_sticky_resource(struct resource *bar_res);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
