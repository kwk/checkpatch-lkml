Allright, I think I nailed it (finally !)
^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'interrutps' may be misspelled - perhaps 'interrupts'?

which uses our i2c and PMU drivers expecting interrutps to work,

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'vias == NULL'
#148: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:1030:
+	if ((vias == NULL) || (!pmu_fully_inited) || !pmu_has_adb)

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around '!pmu_fully_inited'
#148: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:1030:
+	if ((vias == NULL) || (!pmu_fully_inited) || !pmu_has_adb)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vias"
#148: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:1030:
+	if ((vias == NULL) || (!pmu_fully_inited) || !pmu_has_adb)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
