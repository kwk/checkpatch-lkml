#45: 
add the kernel generic bits - these are present even if !CONFIG_ASYNC_SUPPORT.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "t->async_ready"
#97: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1068:
+	return t->async_ready != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#169: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3443:
+		if (prev->state && !(preempt_count() & PREEMPT_ACTIVE) &&
