BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#77: FILE: lib/bsearch.c:81:
+				int *ret;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
