Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'lock' - possible side-effects?
#132: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2297:
+#define cond_resched_lock(lock) ({				  \
+	__might_sleep(__FILE__, __LINE__, spin_is_locked(lock) ?  \
+					  PREEMPT_OFFSET : 0);	  \
+	__cond_resched_lock(lock);				  \
 })

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#133: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2298:
+	__might_sleep(__FILE__, __LINE__, spin_is_locked(lock) ?  \

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
