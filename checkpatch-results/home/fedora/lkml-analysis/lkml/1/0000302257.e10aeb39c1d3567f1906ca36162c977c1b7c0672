CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#154: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:203:
+		error = get_user(timeout_sec, (long __user *) arg);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#190: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:248:
+		struct super_block *sb
+			= filp->f_path.dentry->d_inode->i_sb;

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#198: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:256:
+		error = get_user(timeout_sec, (long __user *) arg);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#217: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:275:
+				add_freeze_timeout(sb->s_bdev,
+					timeout_msec);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct block_device *' should also have an identifier name
#321: FILE: include/linux/buffer_head.h:173:
+struct super_block *freeze_bdev(struct block_device *, long timeout_msec);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#358: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:2111:
+extern void add_freeze_timeout(struct block_device *bdev, long timeout_msec);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#359: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:2112:
+extern void del_freeze_timeout(struct block_device *bdev);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#360: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:2113:
