WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#98: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#135: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco/orinoco.c:1676:
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: New link status: %s (%04x)\n",

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buf"
#159: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco/orinoco.c:5079:
+		if (buf == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#170: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco/orinoco.c:5083:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#342: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/p54/p54usb.c:324:
+	hdr->device_addr = ((struct p54_hdr *) skb->data)->req_id;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
