#27: 
Provide a schedule_on_each_cpu_wq() function that uses a workqueue to do all

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#45: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:182:
+extern int schedule_on_each_cpu_wq(struct workqueue_struct *wq, work_func_t func);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
