#41: 
Now, reference to swap is counted by swap_map[], an array of unsigned short.

This patch adds a flag SWAP_HAS_CACHE and recored information that a swap entry

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#92: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:304:
+extern void swap_duplicate(swp_entry_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'swp_entry_t' should also have an identifier name
#92: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:304:
+extern void swap_duplicate(swp_entry_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'susupend' may be misspelled - perhaps 'suspend'?
#177: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:443:
+/* The only caller of this function is now susupend routine */
                                            ^^^^^^^^

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#227: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:517:

+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
