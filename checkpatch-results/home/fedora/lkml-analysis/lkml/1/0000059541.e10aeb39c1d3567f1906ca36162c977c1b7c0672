ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#169: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:700:
+static int run_ksoftirqd(void * __bind_cpu)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#289: FILE: kernel/softlockup.c:212:
+		BUG_ON(per_cpu(softlockup_watchdog, hotcpu));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#353: FILE: kernel/time/timer_stats.c:352:
+		spinlock_t *lock = &per_cpu(tstats_lookup_lock, cpu);
+		spin_lock_irqsave(lock, flags);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
