CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#149: FILE: include/linux/slow-work.h:117:
+extern int delayed_slow_work_enqueue(struct delayed_slow_work *dwork,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:MEMORY_BARRIER: memory barrier without comment

+	smp_mb();

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#191: FILE: kernel/slow-work.c:430:
+		 * finish */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#195: FILE: kernel/slow-work.c:434:
+		BUG_ON(timer_pending(&dwork->timer));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
