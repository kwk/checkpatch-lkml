Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'udpate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'update'?

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#177: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:269:
+		inode->i_ctime = inode->i_mtime = curtime;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
