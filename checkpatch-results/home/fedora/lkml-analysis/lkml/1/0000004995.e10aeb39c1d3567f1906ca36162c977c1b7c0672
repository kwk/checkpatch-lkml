WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#44: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#55: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/Kconfig:7:
+choice
+	prompt "ST SPEAr Family"
+	default ARCH_SPEAR3XX
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#98: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/gpt.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#99: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/gpt.c:2:
+ * arch/arm/plat-spear/gpt.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of const init definition must use __initconst
#122: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/gpt.c:25:
+static const char *src_clk_con_id[] __initdata = {

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#142: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/gpt.c:45:
+static inline void spear_timer_write_reg(struct spear_timer *timer, u32 reg,
+						u16 value)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#149: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/gpt.c:52:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "timer"
#231: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/gpt.c:134:
+	if (timer != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#705: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/time.c:65:
+	BUG_ON(timer == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!timer"
#705: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/time.c:65:

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#725: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/time.c:85:
+/*
+* Clock Event

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
