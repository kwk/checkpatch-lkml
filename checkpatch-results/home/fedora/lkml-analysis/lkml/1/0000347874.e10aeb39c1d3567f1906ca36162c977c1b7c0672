WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#95: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c:336:
+		if (batch->index) {
+			__flush_tlb_pending(batch);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#127: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/prom.c:83:
+extern raw_rwlock_t devtree_lock;	/* temporary while merging */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
