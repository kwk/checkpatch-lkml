#40: 
It also includes some uml __init fixups so that we can __initdata also its command_line.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after command_line[COMMAND_LINE_SIZE]
#103: FILE: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c:47:
+static char __initdata command_line[COMMAND_LINE_SIZE] = { 0 };

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
