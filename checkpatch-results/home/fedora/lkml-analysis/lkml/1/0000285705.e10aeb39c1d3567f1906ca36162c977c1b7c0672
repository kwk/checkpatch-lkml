WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#61: FILE: arch/x86/configs/x86_64_defconfig:10:
+CONFIG_DEFCONFIG_LIST="arch/x86/configs/x86_64_defconfig"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
