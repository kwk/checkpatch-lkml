WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#86: FILE: drivers/watchdog/Kconfig:372:
+config SBC_FITPC2_WATCHDOG
+	tristate "Compulab SBC-FITPC2 watchdog"
+	depends on X86
+	---help---
+	  This is the driver for the built-in watchdog timer on the fit-PC2
+	  Single-board computer made by Compulab.
+
+	  It`s possible to enable watchdog timer either from BIOS (F2) or from booted Linux.
+	  When "Watchdog Timer Value" enabled one can set 31-255 s operational range.
+
+	  Entering BIOS setup temporary disables watchdog operation regardless to current state,
+	  so system will not be restarted while user in BIOS setup.
+
+	  Once watchdog was enabled the system will be restarted every
+	  "Watchdog Timer Value" period, so to prevent it user can restart or
+	  disable the watchdog.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called sbc_fitpc2_wdt.
+
+	  Most people will say N.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
