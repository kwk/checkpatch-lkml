Subject: [PATCH 02/13] x86: add save_stack_trace_bp() for tracing from a specific stack frame

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: include/linux/stacktrace.h:12:
+extern void save_stack_trace_bp(struct stack_trace *trace, unsigned long bp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
