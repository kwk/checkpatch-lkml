Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __cpuinitdata should be placed after sync_lock
#276: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tsc_sync.c:36:
+static __cpuinitdata arch_spinlock_t sync_lock = __ARCH_SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
