CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#286: FILE: include/linux/pid.h:122:
+extern struct pid *alloc_pid(struct pid_namespace *ns, pid_t pid_nr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'clone_pid <= 1'
#366: FILE: kernel/fork.c:972:
+	if ((clone_flags & CLONE_WITH_PID) && (clone_pid <= 1))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#389: FILE: kernel/fork.c:1178:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#463: FILE: kernel/pid.c:265:
+	for (i = level-1; i >= 0; i--) {
 	              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
