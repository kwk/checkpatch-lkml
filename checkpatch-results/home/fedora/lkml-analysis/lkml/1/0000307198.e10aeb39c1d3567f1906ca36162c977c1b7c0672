WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead
#137: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:915:
+	synchronize_sched();

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#157: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:932:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

#197: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:1247:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
