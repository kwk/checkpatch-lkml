WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#246: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:101:
+		struct kobject *dup_slot;
+		dup_slot = kset_find_obj(pci_slots_kset, new_name);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#365: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:208:
+	if (slot && hotplug) {
[...]
-	}
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#366: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:209:
+		if ((err = slot->hotplug ? -EBUSY : 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#367: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:210:
+		if ((err = slot->hotplug ? -EBUSY : 0)
+		     || (err = rename_slot(slot,name))) {

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
#367: FILE: drivers/pci/slot.c:210:
+		     || (err = rename_slot(slot,name))) {
 		                               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
