#v9 patch I posted a few days ago in .25 so KVM/GRU will be 100%

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#154: FILE: mm/memory.c:1648:
+		old_page = new_page = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
