Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#107: FILE: include/asm-alpha/thread_info.h:86:
+#define _TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK	(1<<TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
