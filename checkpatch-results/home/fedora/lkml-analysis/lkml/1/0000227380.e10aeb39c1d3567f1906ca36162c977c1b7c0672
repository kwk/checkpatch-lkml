CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#65: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode_amd.c:249:
+	total_size = (unsigned long) (section_hdr[4] + (section_hdr[5] << 8));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#74: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode_amd.c:262:
+		if (get_ucode_data(mc, buf + UCODE_CONTAINER_SECTION_HDR, total_size)) {
[...]
 		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
