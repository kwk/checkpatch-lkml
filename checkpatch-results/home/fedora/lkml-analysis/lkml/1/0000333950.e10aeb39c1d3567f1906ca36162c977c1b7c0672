WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#348: FILE: fs/gfs2/ops_file.c:409:
+static struct vm_operations_struct gfs2_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.
