WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#68: FILE: Makefile:511:
+# Arch Makefiles may override this setting

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'resonable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'reasonable'?
