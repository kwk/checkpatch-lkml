WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#74: FILE: drivers/char/Kconfig:753:
+config JS_RTC
+	tristate "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support"
+	depends on SPARC32 && PCI
+	---help---
+	  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with
+	  major number 10 and minor number 135 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
+	  will get access to the real time clock (or hardware clock) built
+	  into your computer.
+
+	  Every PC has such a clock built in. It can be used to generate
+	  signals from as low as 1Hz up to 8192Hz, and can also be used
+	  as a 24 hour alarm. It reports status information via the file
+	  /proc/driver/rtc and its behaviour is set by various ioctls on
+	  /dev/rtc.
+
+	  If you think you have a use for such a device (such as periodic data
+	  sampling), then say Y here, and read <file:Documentation/rtc.txt>
+	  for details.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called js-rtc.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
