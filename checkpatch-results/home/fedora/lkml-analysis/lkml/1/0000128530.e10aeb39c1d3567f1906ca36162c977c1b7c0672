ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#116: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:119:
+extern unsigned long long clockevent_delta2ns(unsigned long latch,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#117: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:120:
+extern unsigned long long clockevent_delta2ns(unsigned long latch,
  					 struct clock_event_device *evt);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#201: FILE: kernel/time/clockevents.c:39:
+unsigned long long clockevent_delta2ns(unsigned long latch,
  				  struct clock_event_device *evt)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#205: FILE: kernel/time/clockevents.c:42:
+	unsigned long long clc = ((unsigned long long) latch << evt->shift);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#284: FILE: kernel/time/tick-sched.c:280:
+	if (delta_jiffies >= max_jiffies) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
