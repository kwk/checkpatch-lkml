WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#73: FILE: drivers/hwmon/applesmc.c:516:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#78: FILE: drivers/hwmon/applesmc.c:521:
+static struct dev_pm_ops applesmc_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
