WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#22: 
It is based on the previously submitted code by Alessandro Zummo, but is changed to use the new GPIO driver with 2.6.33, and the driver has been moved to drivers/leds where it belongs.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#40: FILE: drivers/leds/Kconfig:61:
+config LEDS_NET5501
+	tristate "LED Support for Soekris net5501 series Error LED"
+	depends on LEDS_CLASS && LEDS_GPIO_PLATFORM && GPIO_CS5535
+	select LEDS_TRIGGER_DEFAULT_ON
+	default n
+	help
+	  Add support for the Soekris net5501 board (detection, error led
+	  and GPIO).
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#65: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#70: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-net5501.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after boards[]
#122: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-net5501.c:53:
+static struct soekris_board __initdata boards[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1377655732.3619.19.camel@joe-AO722/

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#136: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-net5501.c:67:
+	if (!rombase)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
