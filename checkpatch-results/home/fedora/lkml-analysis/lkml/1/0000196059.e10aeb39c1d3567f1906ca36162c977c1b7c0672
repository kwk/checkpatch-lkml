WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'intel_iommu_domain_init', this function's name, in a string
#70: FILE: drivers/pci/intel-iommu.c:2676:
+			"intel_iommu_domain_init: dmar_domain == NULL\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'intel_iommu_domain_init', this function's name, in a string
#79: FILE: drivers/pci/intel-iommu.c:2681:
+			"intel_iommu_domain_init() failed\n");
