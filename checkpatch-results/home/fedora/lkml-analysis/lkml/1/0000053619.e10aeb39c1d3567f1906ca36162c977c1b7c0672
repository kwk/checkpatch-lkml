CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#125: FILE: mm/memory.c:379:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#127: FILE: mm/memory.c:381:
+static inline void add_mm_rss(struct mm_struct *mm,
+	int file_rss, int anon_rss, int swap_usage, int low_rss)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#159: FILE: mm/memory.c:665:
+	rss[3] = rss[2] = rss[1] = rss[0] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
