CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#100: FILE: include/linux/clockchips.h:119:
+extern u64 clockevent_delta2ns(unsigned long latch,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#114: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1243:
 	printk(KERN_WARNING "hrtimer: interrupt too slow, "
+	       "forcing clock min delta to %llu ns\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
