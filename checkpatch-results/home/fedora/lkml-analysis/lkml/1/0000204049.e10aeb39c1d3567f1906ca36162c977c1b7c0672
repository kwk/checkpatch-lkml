CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!iter->ent"
#49: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:1842:
+	if (iter->ent == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#70: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:1863:
+	if (m->count + len < m->size) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#73: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:1866:
+	} else

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#80: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:1873:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
