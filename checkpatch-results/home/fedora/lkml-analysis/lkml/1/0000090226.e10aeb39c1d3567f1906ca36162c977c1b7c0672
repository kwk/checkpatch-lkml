CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "strstr"
#103: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/early_printk.c:200:
+	keep = (strstr(buf, "keep") != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <orig_video_isVGA>
#115: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/early_printk.c:212:
+		    boot_params.screen_info.orig_video_isVGA == 1) {

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#163: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1136:
+	struct console *nextcon;
+	if (!bootconsole)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#168: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1141:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "turn off boot console %s%d\n",

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#171: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1144:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "ERROR unregistering %s%d\n",

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#190: FILE: kernel/printk.c:1167:
 	if (console_drivers) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
