CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#62: FILE: arch/mn10300/kernel/mn10300_ksyms.c:13:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#71: FILE: arch/mn10300/kernel/mn10300_ksyms.c:40:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_thread);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
