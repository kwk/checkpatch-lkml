CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!gfs2_glock_is_locked_by_me"
#120: FILE: fs/gfs2/inode.c:496:
+	if (gfs2_glock_is_locked_by_me(dip->i_gl) == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*gh)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct gfs2_holder)...)
#141: FILE: fs/gfs2/ops_address.c:516:
+		gh = kmalloc(sizeof(struct gfs2_holder), GFP_NOFS);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#171: FILE: fs/gfs2/ops_address.c:832:
+	BUG_ON(gfs2_glock_is_locked_by_me(ip->i_gl) == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
