CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*msrs)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct msr)...)
#99: FILE: drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:2772:
+	msrs = kzalloc(sizeof(struct msr) * (last_cpu - first_cpu + 1),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
