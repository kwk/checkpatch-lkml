conveniently because PCI ID is a unique identifier and platform-independent.

WARNING:PREFER_SEQ_PUTS: Prefer seq_puts to seq_printf
#206: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/proc.c:347:
+	seq_printf(seq, "Device\tS-state\t  Status   Sysfs node\t\tPCI ID\n");

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!found_dev"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
