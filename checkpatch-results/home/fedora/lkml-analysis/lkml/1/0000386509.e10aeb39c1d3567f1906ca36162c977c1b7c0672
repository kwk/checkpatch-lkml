would it not be preferrable to re-pin such tasks and let them proceed?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#61: 
This patch would insert a preference to migrate such a task to some cpu within

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#110: FILE: kernel/sched.c:5096:
+	if (dest_cpu == NR_CPUS) {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#149: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:25:
+extern cpumask_t cpuset_cpus_allowed_locked(struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#157: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:91:
 }
+static inline cpumask_t cpuset_cpus_allowed_locked(struct task_struct *p)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
