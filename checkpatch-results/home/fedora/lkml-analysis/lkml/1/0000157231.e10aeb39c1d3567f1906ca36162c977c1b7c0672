WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#56: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c:1054:
+	BUG_ON(me->mm);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rcba_base"
#80: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c:77:
+	BUG_ON(rcba_base == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
