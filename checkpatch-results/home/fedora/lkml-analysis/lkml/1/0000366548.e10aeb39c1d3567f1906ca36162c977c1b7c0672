WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#90: FILE: drivers/input/misc/apanel.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#457: FILE: drivers/input/misc/apanel.c:368:

+		else if (device_chip[devno] != CHIP_NONE)

+		else if (method != 1 && method != 2 && method != 4) {
[...]
+		} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
