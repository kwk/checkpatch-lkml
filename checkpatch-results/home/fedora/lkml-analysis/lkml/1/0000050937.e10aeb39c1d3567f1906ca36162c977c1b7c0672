WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#121: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:766:
+		int res;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#134: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:779:
+			if (dialog_input_result[0]) {
[...]
+			} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
