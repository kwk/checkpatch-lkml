WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#67: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:210:
+	ide_startstop_t (*callback) (ide_drive_t *);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#67: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:210:
+	ide_startstop_t (*callback) (ide_drive_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#141: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1186:
 		debug_log(DBG_SENSE, "Packet command completed, %d bytes"
+				" transferred\n", pc->xferred);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#237: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1643:
+	pc->rq_xfer = pc->buf_size = size;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#247: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1658:
