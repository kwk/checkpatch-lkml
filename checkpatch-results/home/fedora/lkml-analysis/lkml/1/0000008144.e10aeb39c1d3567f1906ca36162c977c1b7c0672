CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/uaccess.h:268:
+extern void copy_from_user_overflow(void)

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#79: FILE: arch/s390/Kconfig.debug:9:
+config DEBUG_STRICT_USER_COPY_CHECKS
+	bool "Strict user copy size checks"
+	---help---
+	  Enabling this option turns a certain set of sanity checks for user
+	  copy operations into compile time warnings.
+
+	  The copy_from_user() etc checks are there to help test if there
+	  are sufficient security checks on the length argument of
+	  the copy operation, by having gcc prove that the argument is
+	  within bounds.
+
+	  If unsure, or if you run an older (pre 4.4) gcc, say N.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
