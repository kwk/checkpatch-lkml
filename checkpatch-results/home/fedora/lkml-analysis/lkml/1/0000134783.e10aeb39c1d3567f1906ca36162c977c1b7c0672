WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#134: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c:703:
+			BUG_ON(!spte);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rmap_write_protect', this function's name, in a string
#138: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c:707:
+			pgprintk("rmap_write_protect(large): spte "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#139: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c:708:
+			pgprintk("rmap_write_protect(large): spte "
+				 "%p %llx %lld\n", spte, *spte, gfn);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
