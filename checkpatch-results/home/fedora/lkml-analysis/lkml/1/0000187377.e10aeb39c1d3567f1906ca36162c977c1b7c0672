CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#105: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1890:
+			order = sc.order = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
