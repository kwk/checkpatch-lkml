CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#303: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:177:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#350: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:217:
+extern int helper_wait(int pid, int nohang, char *pname);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
