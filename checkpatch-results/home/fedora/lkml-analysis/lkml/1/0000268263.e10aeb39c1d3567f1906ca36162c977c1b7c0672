Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!floppy->failed_pc"
#56: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:472:
+	if (floppy->failed_pc == NULL && rq->cmd[0] != GPCMD_REQUEST_SENSE)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
