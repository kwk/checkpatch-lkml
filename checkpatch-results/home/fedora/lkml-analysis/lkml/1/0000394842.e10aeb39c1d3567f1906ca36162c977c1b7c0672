CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#158: FILE: include/linux/security.h:54:
+extern int cap_inode_killpriv(struct dentry *dentry);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#179: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1245:
+	int (*inode_killpriv) (struct dentry *dentry);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
