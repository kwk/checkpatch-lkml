Subject: [PATCH] ide: fix kmalloc() failure handling in ide_driveid_update()

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#61: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-iops.c:297:
+	int rc;
+	u8 uninitialized_var(s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#61: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-iops.c:297:
+	u8 uninitialized_var(s);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 's' should also have an identifier name
#61: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-iops.c:297:
+	u8 uninitialized_var(s);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!id"
#64: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-iops.c:300:
+	if (id == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#110: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-iops.c:349:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: %s: bad status\n", drive->name, __func__);
