CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drmP.h:836:
+extern long drm_ioctl(struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
