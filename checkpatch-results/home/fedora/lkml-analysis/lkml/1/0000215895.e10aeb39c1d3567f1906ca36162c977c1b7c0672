Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#161: FILE: include/linux/lockdep.h:363:
+extern void lock_acquired(struct lockdep_map *lock, unsigned long ip);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#312: FILE: kernel/lockdep_proc.c:584:
+			seq_line(m, '-', 40-namelen, namelen);
 			                   ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#316: FILE: kernel/lockdep_proc.c:588:
+		snprintf(ip, sizeof(ip), "[<%p>]",
+				(void *)class->contending_point[i]);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#318: FILE: kernel/lockdep_proc.c:590:
+		seq_printf(m, "%40s %14lu %29s %s\n", name,
+				stats->contending_point[i],

WARNING:PREFER_SEQ_PUTS: Prefer seq_puts to seq_printf
#329: FILE: kernel/lockdep_proc.c:602:
+	seq_printf(m, "lock_stat version 0.3\n");
