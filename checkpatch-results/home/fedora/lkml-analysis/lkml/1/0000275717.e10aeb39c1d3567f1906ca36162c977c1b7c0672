WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#62: FILE: drivers/serial/68328serial.c:1416:
+	for (i = 0; i < BAUD_TABLE_SIZE); i++)

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#89: FILE: drivers/serial/mcfserial.c:149:
 };
+#define MCFRS_BAUD_TABLE_SIZE ARRAY_SIZE(mcfrs_baud_table)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
