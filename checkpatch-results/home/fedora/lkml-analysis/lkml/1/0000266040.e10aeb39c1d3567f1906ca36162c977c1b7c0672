WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#135: FILE: kernel/user.c:248:
+	struct user_struct *up;
+	up = container_of(kobj, struct user_struct, kobj);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ns)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct user_namespace)...)
#173: FILE: kernel/user_namespace.c:25:
+	ns = kzalloc(sizeof(struct user_namespace), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
