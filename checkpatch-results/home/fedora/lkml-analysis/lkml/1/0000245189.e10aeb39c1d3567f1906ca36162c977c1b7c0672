WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#41: 
IOW, I think it would be much saner if we did the following: make ..._test()

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#125: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:71:
+		inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = zerotime;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#127: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:73:
+		/* inode->i_nlink is left 1 - arguably wrong for directories,
+		   but it's the best we can do without reading the directory

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#128: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:74:
+^I           contents.  1 yields the right result in GNU find, even$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
