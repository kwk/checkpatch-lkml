ERROR:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Unrecognized email address: 'Joe Perches'
#71: 
Signed-off-by: Joe Perches

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: include/linux/kallsyms.h:45:
+extern int snprint_symbol(char *buffer, size_t size, unsigned long address);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#156: FILE: kernel/kallsyms.c:115:
+			if (skipped_first && size > 1) {
[...]
 			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#292: FILE: kernel/kallsyms.c:410:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#315: FILE: kernel/module.c:2611:
+ * not to lock to avoid deadlock on oopses, simply disable preemption. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#370: FILE: lib/vsprintf.c:580:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
