CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#66: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:40:
+		desc->a = desc->b = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'useable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'usable'?
#140: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:108:
+	info->useable = desc->avl;
 	      ^^^^^^^
