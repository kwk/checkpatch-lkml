CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#95: FILE: fs/namespace.c:1108:
+	res = q = clone_mnt(mnt, dentry, flag, mnt_flags);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#112: FILE: fs/namespace.c:1150:
 }
+struct vfsmount *copy_tree(struct vfsmount *mnt, struct dentry *dentry,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#125: FILE: fs/namespace.c:1329:
+static int do_loopback(struct nameidata *nd, char *old_name, int flags,
                                          ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#168: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:128:
+#define MS_BIND_FLAGS	(1<<24) /* For MS_BIND, take mnt_flags from
                      	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#168: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:128:
+#define MS_BIND_FLAGS	(1<<24) /* For MS_BIND, take mnt_flags from

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#169: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:129:
+				 * args, not from source mountpoint */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
