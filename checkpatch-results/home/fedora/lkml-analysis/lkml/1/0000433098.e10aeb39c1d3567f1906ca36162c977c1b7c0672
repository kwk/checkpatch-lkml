#37: 
- Transfer generic header note "using asm to fix a gcc bug" to where it belongs

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#489: FILE: include/linux/marker.h:50:
+ * "used" attribute to fix a gcc 4.1.x bug. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
