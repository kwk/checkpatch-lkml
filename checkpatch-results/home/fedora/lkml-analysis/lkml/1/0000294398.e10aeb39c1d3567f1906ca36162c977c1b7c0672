WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#38: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#43: FILE: arch/ia64/kvm/vmm.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#60: FILE: arch/ia64/kvm/vmm.c:18:
+ * this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20131006222342.GT19510@leaf/

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#64: FILE: arch/ia64/kvm/vmm.c:22:

+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#73: FILE: arch/ia64/kvm/vmm.c:31:
+extern char kvm_ia64_ivt;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#74: FILE: arch/ia64/kvm/vmm.c:32:
+extern fpswa_interface_t *vmm_fpswa_interface;

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo __init  bar" should be "foo __init bar"
#83: FILE: arch/ia64/kvm/vmm.c:41:
+static int __init  kvm_vmm_init(void)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#85: FILE: arch/ia64/kvm/vmm.c:43:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited before semicolon

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
