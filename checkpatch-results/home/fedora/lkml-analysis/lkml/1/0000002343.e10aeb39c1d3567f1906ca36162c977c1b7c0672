Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct of_device_id should normally be const

+static struct of_device_id tis_of_platform_match[] = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
