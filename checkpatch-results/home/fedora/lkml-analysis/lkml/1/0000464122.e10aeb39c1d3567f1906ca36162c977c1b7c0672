ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#45: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:3431:
+	if (return_code = IO_OK) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#45: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:3431:
+	if (return_code = IO_OK) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
