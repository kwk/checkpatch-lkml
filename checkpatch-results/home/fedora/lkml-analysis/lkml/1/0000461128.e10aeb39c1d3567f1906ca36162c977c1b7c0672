WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#66: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvbdev.c:203:
+	struct file_operations *dvbdevfops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dvbdevfops)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct file_operations)...)
#75: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvbdev.c:224:
+	dvbdevfops = kzalloc(sizeof(struct file_operations), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
