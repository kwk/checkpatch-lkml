WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#106: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-of.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sdhci_ops should normally be const
#133: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-of.c:28:
+	struct sdhci_ops ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#201: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-of.c:96:
+		/* fall through */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.
