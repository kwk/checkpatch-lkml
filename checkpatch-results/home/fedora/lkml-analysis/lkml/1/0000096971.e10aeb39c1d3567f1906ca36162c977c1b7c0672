After some further work, here's an updated patch that works properly on ARM,

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_DECOMP_WDOG' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#201: FILE: arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c:208:
+#define ARCH_HAS_DECOMP_WDOG

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

spaces are never used for indentation.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
