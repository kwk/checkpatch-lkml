ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#92: FILE: mm/bootmem.c:216:
+         */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#96: FILE: mm/bootmem.c:220:
+		if (goal >= bdata->node_boot_start && PFN_DOWN(goal) < end_pfn) {
[...]
 				preferred = bdata->last_success;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
