+/*

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#68: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:452:
+	return (long) (active / (inactive + 1));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:68:
+extern long mem_cgroup_reclaim_imbalance(struct mem_cgroup *mem);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
