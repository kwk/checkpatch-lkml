WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#72: FILE: block/Kconfig.iosched:135:
+config TRACK_ASYNC_CONTEXT
+	bool "Determine async request context from bio"
+	depends on GROUP_IOSCHED
+	select CGROUP_BLKIO
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  Normally async request is attributed to the task submitting the
+	  request. With group ioscheduling, for accurate accounting of
+	  async writes, one needs to map the request to original task/cgroup
+	  which originated the request and not the submitter of the request.
+
+	  Currently there are generic io tracking patches to provide facility
+	  to map bio to original owner. If this option is set, for async
+	  request, original owner of the bio is decided by using io tracking
+	  patches otherwise we continue to attribute the request to the
+	  submitting thread.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#536: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:1822:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
