#152: FILE: kernel/pid.c:395:
+	list_for_each_entry (pcache, &pid_caches_lh, list)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*pcache)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct pid_cache)...)
#156: FILE: kernel/pid.c:399:
+	pcache = kmalloc(sizeof(struct pid_cache), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pcache"
#157: FILE: kernel/pid.c:400:
+	if (pcache == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#162: FILE: kernel/pid.c:405:
+	cachep = kmem_cache_create(pcache->name,
+			/* FIXME add numerical ids here */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cachep"
#164: FILE: kernel/pid.c:407:
+	if (cachep == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!init_pid_ns.pid_cachep"
#190: FILE: kernel/pid.c:472:
+	if (init_pid_ns.pid_cachep == NULL)
