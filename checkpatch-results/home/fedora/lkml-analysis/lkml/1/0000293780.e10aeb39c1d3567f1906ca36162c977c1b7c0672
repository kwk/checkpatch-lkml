The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*memb)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dlm_member)...)
#178: FILE: fs/dlm/member.c:222:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
