WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pipe_buf_operations should normally be const
#96: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2528:
+static struct pipe_buf_operations tracing_pipe_buf_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
