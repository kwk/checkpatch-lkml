WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#57: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:55:
+# define rcu_read_lock_check_upper_limit() \
+		WARN_ON_ONCE(current->rcu_read_lock_nesting > 100);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#73: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:140:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
