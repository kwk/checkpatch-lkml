CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#104: FILE: drivers/lguest/interrupts_and_traps.c:173:
+		trap->raw32.a = trap->raw32.b = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

+	trap->raw32.a = ((__KERNEL_CS|GUEST_PL)<<16) | (lo&0x0000FFFF);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
