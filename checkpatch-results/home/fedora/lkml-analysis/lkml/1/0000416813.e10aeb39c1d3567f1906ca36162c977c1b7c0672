CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#357: FILE: block/blktrace.c:293:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#411: FILE: include/linux/blktrace_api.h:125:
+struct gtsc_trace_setup $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#412: FILE: include/linux/blktrace_api.h:126:
+struct gtsc_trace_setup 
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
