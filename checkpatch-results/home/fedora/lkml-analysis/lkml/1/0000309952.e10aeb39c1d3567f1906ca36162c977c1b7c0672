CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#103: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:3144:
+	struct Scsi_Host *shost = sdev->host;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#162: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:812:
+extern int ata_scsi_lb_request_fn(struct request *req);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
