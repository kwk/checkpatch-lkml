CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#81: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/perf_event.h:22:
+#define ARCH_PERFMON_EVENTSEL_ANY			  (1 << 21)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#111: FILE: arch/x86/mm/kmmio.c:541:
+	unsigned long* dr6_p = (unsigned long *)ERR_PTR(arg->err);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#230: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-kmem.c:787:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
