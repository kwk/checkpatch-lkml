WARNING:JIFFIES_COMPARISON: Comparing get_jiffies_64() is almost always wrong; prefer time_after64, time_before64 and friends

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "refreshed"
#66: FILE: fs/fuse/dir.c:797:
+	if (refreshed != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
