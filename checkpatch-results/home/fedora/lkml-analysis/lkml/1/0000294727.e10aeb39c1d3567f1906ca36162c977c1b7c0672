CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#91: FILE: drivers/net/tg3.c:4143:
+	if (GET_ASIC_REV(tp->pci_chip_rev_id) != ASIC_REV_5701)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses - maybe == should be = ?
#119: FILE: drivers/net/tg3.c:11354:
+	if ((GET_ASIC_REV(tp->pci_chip_rev_id) == ASIC_REV_5701)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
