WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#60: FILE: include/asm-i386/bug.h:12:
+#define BUG() __BUG(__FILE__, __LINE__)

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#65: FILE: include/asm-i386/bug.h:17:
+static void __always_inline __noreturn __BUG(const char *file, int line)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
