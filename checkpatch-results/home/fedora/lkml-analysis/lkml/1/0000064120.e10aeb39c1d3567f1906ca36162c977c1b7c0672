WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '_get_more_prng_bytes', this function's name, in a string
#117: FILE: crypto/ansi_cprng.c:95:
+	dbgprint("Calling _get_more_prng_bytes for context %p\n", ctx);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
