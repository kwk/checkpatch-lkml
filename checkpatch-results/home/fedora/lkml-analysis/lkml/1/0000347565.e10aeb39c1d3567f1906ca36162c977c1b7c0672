CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#97: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:337:
+extern void timer_stats_update_stats(void *timer, struct pid *pid, void *startf,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#163: FILE: kernel/time/timer_list.c:55:
+	pid_t upid = pid_vnr(timer->start_pid);
+	if (!upid)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
