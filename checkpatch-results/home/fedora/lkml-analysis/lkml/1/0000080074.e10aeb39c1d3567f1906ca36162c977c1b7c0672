WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'chip' should also have an identifier name
#49: FILE: sound/pci/via82xx.c:2438:
+	struct via82xx *uninitialized_var(chip);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
