CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!req_root"
#58: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs_kern.c:973:
+	if (req_root == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#72: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs_kern.c:983:
+	if(host_root_path == NULL)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#90: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs_kern.c:998:
+	 * host_root_path through hostfs_destroy_inode! */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
