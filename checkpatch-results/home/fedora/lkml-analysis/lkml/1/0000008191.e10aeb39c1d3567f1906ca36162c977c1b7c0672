CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*lp3971)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct lp3971)...)
#110: FILE: drivers/regulator/lp3971.c:480:
+	lp3971 = kzalloc(sizeof(struct lp3971), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!lp3971"
#111: FILE: drivers/regulator/lp3971.c:481:
+	if (lp3971 == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
