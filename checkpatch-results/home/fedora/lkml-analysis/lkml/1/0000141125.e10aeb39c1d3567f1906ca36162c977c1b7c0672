Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*atmel_wm97xx)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct atmel_wm97xx)...)
#448: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/atmel-wm97xx.c:352:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
