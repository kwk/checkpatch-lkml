 - When I-cache misses, I-cache will access just the lower layer cache(memory).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#152: FILE: include/asm-ia64/pgtable.h:491:
+extern void __sync_icache_dcache(pte_t pte);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#153: FILE: include/asm-ia64/pgtable.h:492:
+static inline void sync_icache_dcache(pte_t pte) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#306: FILE: arch/ia64/mm/init.c:63:
+	BUG_ON(!pte_exec(pte));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
