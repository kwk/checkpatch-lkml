WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#108: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:121:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#139: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:152:
+	if (elem = find_debug_file(mod_name)) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#161: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:174:
+	if (__dev_dbg_enabled(mod_name, level)) {
+		vprintk(fmt, args);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#168: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:181:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#189: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:299:
+		if (elem = find_debug_file(s)) {

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#190: FILE: lib/dynamic_printk.c:300:
+			elem->level = simple_strtol(level, NULL, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
