> I will try to customize kernel to capture call trace for a precise code path.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#85: FILE: kernel/signal.c:41:
+unsigned long global_arch_ptrace_stop_flag =0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:WxV)
#85: FILE: kernel/signal.c:41:
+unsigned long global_arch_ptrace_stop_flag =0;
                                            ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#93: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1505:
+               global_arch_ptrace_stop_flag = 1;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
