ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#108: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/entry.S:610:
+^Ipopq %rdi^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#275: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/thread_info.h:137:
+#define _TIF_MCE_NOTIFY		(1<<TIF_MCE_NOTIFY)
                        		  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#275: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/thread_info.h:137:
+#define _TIF_MCE_NOTIFY		(1<<TIF_MCE_NOTIFY)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
