Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*sb)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct efs_sb_info)...)
#1126: FILE: fs/efs/super.c:254:
+	sb = kzalloc(sizeof(struct efs_sb_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
