#29: 
MIPS get_cycles only returns a 32 bits TSC (see timex.h). The assumption there

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#82: FILE: arch/mips/include/asm/trace-clock.h:11:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: arch/mips/include/asm/trace-clock.h:15:
+extern u64 trace_clock_read_synthetic_tsc(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'whic' may be misspelled - perhaps 'which'?
#92: FILE: arch/mips/include/asm/trace-clock.h:21:
+ * TSC, whic is provided by trace-clock-32-to-64.
         ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#93: FILE: arch/mips/include/asm/trace-clock.h:22:

+*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#143: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/trace-clock.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
