CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#58: FILE: drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:582:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tty->termiox"
#76: FILE: drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:600:
+	if (tty->termiox == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ld"
#82: FILE: drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:606:
+	if (ld != NULL) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!real_tty->termiox"
#111: FILE: drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:985:
+		if (real_tty->termiox == NULL)

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#122: FILE: drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:996:
+#endif^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#152: FILE: include/linux/termios.h:10:
+struct termiox
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
