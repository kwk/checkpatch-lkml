ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#59: FILE: net/ipv4/route.c:3060:
+static struct ctl_table ipv4_skeleton[] =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __net_initdata should be placed after ipv4_path[]
#67: FILE: net/ipv4/route.c:3068:
+static __net_initdata struct ctl_path ipv4_path[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
