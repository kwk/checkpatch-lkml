WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#85: FILE: drivers/acpi/asus_acpi.c:722:
+	BUG_ON(!*hotk->methods->lcd_status);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#100: FILE: drivers/acpi/asus_acpi.c:769:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "You must pass nonzero value to switch LCD "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#101: FILE: drivers/acpi/asus_acpi.c:770:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "You must pass nonzero value to switch LCD "
+				"status for this model\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#106: FILE: drivers/acpi/asus_acpi.c:775:
+	/* pay attention to lazy evaluation, we don't want to reach
+	   get_lcd_state if lcd_status is empty string */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
