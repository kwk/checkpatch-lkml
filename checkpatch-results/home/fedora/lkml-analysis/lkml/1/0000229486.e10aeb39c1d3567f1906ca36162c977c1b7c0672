  ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#199: FILE: fs/omfs/inode.c:24:
+	struct omfs_sb_info *sbi = OMFS_SB(sb);
+	if (block >= sbi->s_num_blocks)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#289: FILE: fs/omfs/omfs.h:61:
+extern struct buffer_head *omfs_bread(struct super_block *sb, sector_t block);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
