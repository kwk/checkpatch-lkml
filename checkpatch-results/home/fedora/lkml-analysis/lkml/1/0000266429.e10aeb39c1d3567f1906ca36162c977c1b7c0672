WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#118: FILE: arch/x86/lib/copy_user_64.S:248:
+.Ls1e: 	addl $8,%eax		/* eax is bytes left uncopied within the loop (Ls1e: 64 .. Ls8e: 8) */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
