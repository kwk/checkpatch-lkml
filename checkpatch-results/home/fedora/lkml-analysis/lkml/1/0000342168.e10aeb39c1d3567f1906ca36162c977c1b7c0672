CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*mtd_ram)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct mtd_info)...)
#285: FILE: arch/cris/arch-v10/drivers/axisflashmap.c:412:
+		mtd_ram = kmalloc(sizeof(struct mtd_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
