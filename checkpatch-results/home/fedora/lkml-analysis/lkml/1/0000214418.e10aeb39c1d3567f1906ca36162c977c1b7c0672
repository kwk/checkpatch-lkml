WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#95: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#100: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#101: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:2:
+ * drivers/pci/iov.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#115: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:16:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'field' may be better as '(field)' to avoid precedence issues

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#155: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:56:
+	if (dev->bus->number == busnr)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#156: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:57:
+		vf->bus = bus = dev->bus;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#163: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:64:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#338: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:239:

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_RO: Use DEVICE_ATTR_RO
#375: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:276:
+}

The DEVICE_ATTR_RO(name) helper macro can be used instead of
DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0444, name_show, NULL);

Note that the macro automatically appends _show to the named
attribute variable of the device for the show method.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#377: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:278:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(totalvfs, S_IRUGO, totalvfs_show, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

#379: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:280:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(numvfs, S_IWUSR | S_IRUGO, numvfs_show, numvfs_store);

The DEVICE_ATTR_RW(name) helper macro can be used instead of
DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0644, name_show, name_store);

Note that the macro automatically appends _show and _store to the
named attribute variable of the device for the show and store methods.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IWUSR | S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#379: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:280:

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'status_show' to 'enable_show' 'status_store' to 'enable_store'
#380: FILE: drivers/pci/iov.c:281:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(enable, S_IWUSR | S_IRUGO, status_show, status_store);

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
