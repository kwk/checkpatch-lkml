WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'offset' may be better as '(offset)' to avoid precedence issues
#91: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/dma-mapping.h:16:
+#define dma_map_page(dev, page, offset, size, dir) \
+	dma_map_single(dev, page_address(page) + offset, size, dir)

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#98: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/dma-mapping.h:19:
+#define dma_unmap_page(dev, dma_addr, size, dir) \
 	dma_unmap_single(dev, dma_addr, size, dir);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#135: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/dma-mapping.h:25:
+                               size_t size, enum dma_data_direction dir)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#135: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/dma-mapping.h:25:
+                               size_t size, enum dma_data_direction dir)$

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#322: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/pci.h:1:
+#include <asm-generic/pci.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.
