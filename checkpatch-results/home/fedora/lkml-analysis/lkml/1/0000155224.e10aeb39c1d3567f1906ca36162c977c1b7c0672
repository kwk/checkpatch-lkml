Subject: [PATCH 10/27] xen: make sure swiotlb allocation is physically contigious
                                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#94: FILE: drivers/pci/xen-iommu.c:48:
+	unsigned order = get_order(size);

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#96: FILE: drivers/pci/xen-iommu.c:50:
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG "xen_swiotlb_fixup: buf=%p size=%zu order=%u\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'xen_swiotlb_fixup', this function's name, in a string
#96: FILE: drivers/pci/xen-iommu.c:50:
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG "xen_swiotlb_fixup: buf=%p size=%zu order=%u\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#97: FILE: drivers/pci/xen-iommu.c:51:
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG "xen_swiotlb_fixup: buf=%p size=%zu order=%u\n",
+		buf, size, order);

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#116: FILE: include/xen/swiotlb.h:1:
+#ifndef _XEN_SWIOTLB_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#120: FILE: include/xen/swiotlb.h:5:
+extern void xen_swiotlb_fixup(void *buf, size_t size, unsigned long nslabs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
