WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+	int i;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#68: FILE: arch/i386/mm/pageattr.c:85:
+	if (0 && cpu_has_clflush) {
[...]
 	} else if (boot_cpu_data.x86_model >= 4)

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#110: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/pageattr.c:78:
+	   the high level code is not ready yet */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#114: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/pageattr.c:81:
+	else list_for_each_entry(pg, l, lru) {

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
