WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'contollers' may be misspelled - perhaps 'controllers'?
#102: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/piix.c:221:
+ *	ICHx contollers set DMA INTR no matter DMA or PIO.
   	     ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#180: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:722:
+	void	(*clear_irq)(ide_drive_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
