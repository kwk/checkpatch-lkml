CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "p"
#73: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-report.c:55:
+	while (*p != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
