but some node with less NODE_MIN_SIZE will be kicked out of node_possible_map.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#148: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/numa_64.h:28:
+/* Too small nodes confuse the VM badly. Usually they result
+   from BIOS bugs. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
