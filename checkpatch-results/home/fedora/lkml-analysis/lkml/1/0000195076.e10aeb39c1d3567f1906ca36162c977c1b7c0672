#35: 
While debugging a suspend-to-RAM related issue it occured to me that
                                                  ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/trampoline.h:21:
+extern void __init reserve_trampoline_memory(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#130: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/trampoline.c:21:
+	reserve_early(TRAMPOLINE_BASE, TRAMPOLINE_BASE + TRAMPOLINE_SIZE,
+			"TRAMPOLINE");
