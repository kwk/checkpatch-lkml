#31: 
This patch converts the tape->merge_stage pipeline stage into tape->bh, a singly

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*tape_bh)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct idetape_bh)...)
#128: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1300:
+	tape_bh = kmalloc(sizeof(struct idetape_bh), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#613: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:2658:
+	BUG_ON(tape->cur_buf_size);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
