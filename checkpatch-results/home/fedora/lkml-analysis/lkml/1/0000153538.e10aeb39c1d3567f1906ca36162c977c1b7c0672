CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/smp.h> instead of <asm/smp.h>
#104: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/i8253.c:16:
+#include <asm/smp.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#302: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/kdebugfs.c:54:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#653: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/tls.c:1:
+#include <linux/uaccess.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.
