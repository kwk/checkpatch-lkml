Subject: [PATCH 5/9] gigaset: checkpatch cleanup

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tty"
#451: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/interface.c:632:
+	if (tty == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#460: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/interface.c:659:
+	drv->tty = tty = alloc_tty_driver(minors);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tty"
#461: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/interface.c:660:
+	if (tty == NULL)
