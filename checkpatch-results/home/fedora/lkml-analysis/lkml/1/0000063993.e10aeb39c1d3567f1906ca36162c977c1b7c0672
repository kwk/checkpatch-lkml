CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#186: FILE: include/linux/kernel_stat.h:55:
+extern void account_user_time(struct task_struct *, cputime_t, cputime_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#187: FILE: include/linux/kernel_stat.h:56:
+extern void account_system_time(struct task_struct *, int, cputime_t, cputime_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
