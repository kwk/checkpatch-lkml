CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#86: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:2556:
+static int pci_set_vga_state_arch(struct pci_dev *dev, bool decode,
+		      unsigned int command_bits, bool change_bridge)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#135: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:948:
+extern void pci_register_set_vga_state(arch_set_vga_state_t func);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
