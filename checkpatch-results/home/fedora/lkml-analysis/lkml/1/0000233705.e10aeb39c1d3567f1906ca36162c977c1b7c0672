WARNING:BAD_STABLE_ADDRESS_STYLE: Invalid email format for stable: '<stable@kernel.org>		[2.6.26.x]', prefer 'stable@kernel.org # 2.6.26.x'

The email format for stable is incorrect.
Some valid options for stable address are::

  1. stable@vger.kernel.org
  2. stable@kernel.org

For adding version info, the following comment style should be used::

  stable@vger.kernel.org # version info

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#166: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:533:
+	if (entropy_count < 0) {
[...]
-	} else if (r->entropy_count > r->poolinfo->POOLBITS)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
