WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#53: FILE: arch/arm/Kconfig:1275:
+config FDT_LINKED_INTO_ZIMAGE
+	bool "Link a flattened device tree blob into the kernel image"
+	select DTC
+	depends on OF_FLATTREE
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'vmlinux'
#85: FILE: arch/arm/boot/compressed/Makefile:75:
+targets       := vmlinux vmlinux.lds piggy.$(suffix_y) \

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#153: FILE: arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c:278:
+extern char dtb_data_end[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#160: FILE: arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c:285:
+	 * already exists, then just bail */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
