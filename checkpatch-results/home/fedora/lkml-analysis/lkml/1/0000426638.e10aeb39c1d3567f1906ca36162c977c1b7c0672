#29: 
During hibernation we call hibernation_ops->prepare() before creating the image,

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#64: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:222:
+		error = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
