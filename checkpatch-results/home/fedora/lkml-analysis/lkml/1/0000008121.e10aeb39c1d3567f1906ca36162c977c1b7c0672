CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#47: FILE: arch/s390/include/asm/setup.h:74:
+#define MACHINE_FLAG_LPAR	(1UL << 12)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#73: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/early.c:223:
+	if (stsi(&vmms, 3, 2, 2) == -ENOSYS || !vmms.count)

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
