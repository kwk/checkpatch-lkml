CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/compat.h> instead of <asm/compat.h>
#50: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:37:
+#include <asm/compat.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#138: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:190:
+		die ("Low-address protection", regs, int_code);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#206: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:220:
+	if (!rc && instruction == 0x0a77) {
[...]
+	} else if (!rc && instruction == 0x0aad) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#259: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:273:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
