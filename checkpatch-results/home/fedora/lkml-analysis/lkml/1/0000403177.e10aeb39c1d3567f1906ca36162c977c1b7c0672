CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:41:
+extern void mem_container_out_of_memory(struct mem_container *mem);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#92: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:52:
+unsigned long badness(struct task_struct *p, unsigned long uptime,
+			struct mem_container *mem)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "mem"
#101: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:66:
+	if (mem != NULL && mm->mem_container != mem) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#116: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:217:
+static struct task_struct *select_bad_process(unsigned long *ppoints,
+						struct mem_container *mem)
