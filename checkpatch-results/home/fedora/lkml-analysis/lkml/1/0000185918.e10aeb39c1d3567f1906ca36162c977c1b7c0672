WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#79: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#84: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pcf50633.c:1:
+/* NXP PCF50633 RTC Driver

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u8' over 'u_int8_t'

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#264: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pcf50633.c:181:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct rtc_class_ops should normally be const
#337: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pcf50633.c:254:
+static struct rtc_class_ops pcf50633_rtc_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
