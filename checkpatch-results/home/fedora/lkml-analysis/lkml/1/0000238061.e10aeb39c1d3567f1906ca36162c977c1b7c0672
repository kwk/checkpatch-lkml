WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#124: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.h:53:
+int ide_floppy_ioctl(struct inode *, struct file *, unsigned, unsigned long);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#124: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.h:53:
+int ide_floppy_ioctl(struct inode *, struct file *, unsigned, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
