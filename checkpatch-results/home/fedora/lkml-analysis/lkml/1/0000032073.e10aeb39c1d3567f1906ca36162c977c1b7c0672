WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct stacktrace_ops should normally be const
#127: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/stacktrace.h:9:
+struct stacktrace_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#321: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:PRINTF_L: %Ld is non-standard C, use %lld

#1061: FILE: tools/perf/util/probe-event.c:99:

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
