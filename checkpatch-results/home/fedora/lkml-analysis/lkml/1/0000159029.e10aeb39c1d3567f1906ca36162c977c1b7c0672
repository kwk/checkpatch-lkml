CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#65: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init_32.c:844:
+	if (use_gbpages) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '>>' (ctx:VxV)
#68: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init_32.c:847:
+		extra = end - ((end>>PUD_SHIFT) << PUD_SHIFT);
 		                   ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: arch/x86/mm/init_32.c:936:
+	use_pse = use_gbpages = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
