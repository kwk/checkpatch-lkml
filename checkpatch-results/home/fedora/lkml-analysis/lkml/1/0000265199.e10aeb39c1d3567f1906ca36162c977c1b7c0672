The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+		err("%s - usb_submit_urb failed with result %d",
 		     __func__, retval);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'keyspan_pda_write', this function's name, in a string
#291: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/keyspan_pda.c:527:
+	dbg("keyspan_pda_write(%d)", count);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
