WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#114: FILE: kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:3407:
+void sdr_save_trace(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TRACE_PRINTK: Do not use trace_printk() in production code (this can be ignored if built only with a debug config option)
#174: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2777:
+	trace_printk("DIED HERE (%s)\n", current_trace->name);

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#181: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2784:
+	printk("buffer entries=%ld\n", ring_buffer_entries(save_buff));

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
