CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "delegation"
#127: FILE: fs/nfs/delegation.c:171:
+	if (delegation != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ctx->state"
#227: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:525:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#281: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs4_fs.h:181:
+extern int nfs4_do_close(struct path *path, struct nfs4_state *state, int wait);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#289: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs4_fs.h:212:
+extern void nfs4_close_sync(struct path *, struct nfs4_state *, mode_t);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct path *' should also have an identifier name
#289: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs4_fs.h:212:
+extern void nfs4_close_sync(struct path *, struct nfs4_state *, mode_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct nfs4_state *' should also have an identifier name

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#436: FILE: fs/nfs/unlink.c:66:
+	struct nfs_inode *nfsi = NFS_I(dir);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#606: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:667:
+	 * then we need to zero any uninitalised data. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
