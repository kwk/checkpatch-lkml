CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sb->s_op->write_super_lockfs"
#213: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:197:
+		if (sb->s_op->write_super_lockfs == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#219: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:203:
+		error = get_user(timeout_sec, (long __user *) arg);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#264: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:248:
+		struct super_block *sb
+			= filp->f_path.dentry->d_inode->i_sb;

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

#272: FILE: fs/ioctl.c:256:

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct block_device *' should also have an identifier name
#441: FILE: include/linux/buffer_head.h:173:
+struct super_block *freeze_bdev(struct block_device *, long timeout_msec);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#483: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1938:
+extern void put_super(struct super_block *sb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
