WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#58: FILE: block/blk-softirq.c:137:
+			if (locked)
[...]
+			else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#60: FILE: block/blk-softirq.c:139:
+			else {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#111: FILE: block/blk.h:46:
+extern void __blk_complete_request(struct request *, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#153: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:868:
+extern void blk_complete_request_nolock(struct request *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct request *' should also have an identifier name
#153: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:868:
+extern void blk_complete_request_nolock(struct request *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
