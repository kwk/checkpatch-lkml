CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*e_info)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct aer_err_info)...)
#273: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv_core.c:724:
+	e_info = kmalloc(sizeof(struct aer_err_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!e_info"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
