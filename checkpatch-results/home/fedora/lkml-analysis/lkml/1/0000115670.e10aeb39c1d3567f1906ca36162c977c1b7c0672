Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#73: FILE: net/iucv/iucv.c:88:
+static struct dev_pm_ops iucv_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
