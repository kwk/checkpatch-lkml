WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#43: FILE: fs/squashfs/Kconfig:29:
+config SQUASHFS_LZMA
+	bool "Include support for LZMA compressed file systems"
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	select DECOMPRESS_LZMA
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#77: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#82: FILE: fs/squashfs/lzma_wrapper.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#99: FILE: fs/squashfs/lzma_wrapper.c:18:
+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'error', this function's name, in a string
#130: FILE: fs/squashfs/lzma_wrapper.c:49:
+	ERROR("unlzma error: %s\n", m);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#134: FILE: fs/squashfs/lzma_wrapper.c:53:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#138: FILE: fs/squashfs/lzma_wrapper.c:57:
+	struct squashfs_lzma *stream = kzalloc(sizeof(*stream), GFP_KERNEL);
+	if (stream == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!stream"
#138: FILE: fs/squashfs/lzma_wrapper.c:57:
+	if (stream == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!stream->input"
#141: FILE: fs/squashfs/lzma_wrapper.c:60:
+	if (stream->input == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!stream->output"
#144: FILE: fs/squashfs/lzma_wrapper.c:63:
+	if (stream->output == NULL)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#171: FILE: fs/squashfs/lzma_wrapper.c:90:
+static int lzma_uncompress(struct squashfs_sb_info *msblk, void **buffer,
+	struct buffer_head **bh, int b, int offset, int length, int srclength,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#195: FILE: fs/squashfs/lzma_wrapper.c:114:
+	res = unlzma(stream->input, length, NULL, NULL, stream->output, NULL,
+							error);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#200: FILE: fs/squashfs/lzma_wrapper.c:119:
+	res = bytes = get_unaligned_le32(stream->input + 5);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
