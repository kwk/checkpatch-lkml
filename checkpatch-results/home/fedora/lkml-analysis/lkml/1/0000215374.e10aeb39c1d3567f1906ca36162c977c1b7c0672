WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#41: FILE: drivers/staging/wlan-ng/hfa384x.h:827:
+#define		HFA384x_CMD_QOS_GET(value)		((UINT16)((((UINT16)(value))&((UINT16)0x3000)) >> 12))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
