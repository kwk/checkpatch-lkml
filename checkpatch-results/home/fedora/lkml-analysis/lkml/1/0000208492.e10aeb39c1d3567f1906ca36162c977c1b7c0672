CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*card->cmdbuffer)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dump_cmd)...)
#74: FILE: drivers/staging/slicoss/slicoss.c:2694:
+		card->cmdbuffer = kzalloc(sizeof(struct dump_cmd), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
