#17: 
Subject: [PATCH 2/3] ncpfs: fix sparse warnings in ioctl.c

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#57: FILE: fs/ncpfs/ioctl.c:391:
+					struct inode* s_inode = dentry->d_inode;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#62: FILE: fs/ncpfs/ioctl.c:393:
+					if (s_inode) {
[...]
 					} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
