CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#225: FILE: include/linux/fsnotify_backend.h:282:
+extern void __fsnotify_parent(struct path *path, struct dentry *dentry, __u32 mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
