CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: include/linux/trace_seq.h:30:
+extern int trace_seq_vprintf(struct trace_seq *s, const char *fmt, va_list args)

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __printf(2, 0) over __attribute__((format(printf, 2, 0)))
#55: FILE: include/linux/trace_seq.h:31:
+	__attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 0)));
