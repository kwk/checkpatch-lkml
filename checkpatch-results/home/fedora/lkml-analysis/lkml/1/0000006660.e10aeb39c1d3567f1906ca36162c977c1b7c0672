#167: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1018:
+extern int ext4_claim_free_blocks(struct ext4_sb_info *sbi,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
