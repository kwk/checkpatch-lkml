#50: 
this saves a ton of extra space since gcc doesn't need to store the function

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#80: FILE: include/asm-generic/bug.h:36:
+extern void warn_on_slowpath(const char *file, const int line);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#107: FILE: kernel/panic.c:300:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
