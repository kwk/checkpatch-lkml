WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#118: FILE: fs/select.c:118:
+static int pollwake(wait_queue_t *wait, unsigned mode, int sync, void *key)

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#162: FILE: fs/select.c:160:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(poll_schedule_timeout);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#220: FILE: include/linux/poll.h:60:
+	struct task_struct * polling_task;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#229: FILE: include/linux/poll.h:69:
+extern long poll_schedule_timeout(struct poll_wqueues *pwq, int state,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
