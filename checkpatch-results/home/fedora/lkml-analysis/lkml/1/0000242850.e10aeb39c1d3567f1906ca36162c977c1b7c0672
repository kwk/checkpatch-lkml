CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:203:
+extern void printk_tick(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#88: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:204:
+extern int printk_needs_cpu(int);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#88: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:204:
+extern int printk_needs_cpu(int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#111: FILE: include/linux/seqlock.h:76:
+	return spin_is_locked(&sl->lock);

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
