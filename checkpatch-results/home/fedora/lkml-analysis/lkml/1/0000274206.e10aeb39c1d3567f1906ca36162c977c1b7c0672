CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#157: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1631:
+extern int do_truncate(struct path *, loff_t start, unsigned int time_attrs,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct path *' should also have an identifier name
#157: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1631:
+extern int do_truncate(struct path *, loff_t start, unsigned int time_attrs,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#343: FILE: mm/filemap.c:1676:
+		struct iattr newattrs = {.ia_valid = ATTR_FORCE | killsuid };
+		error = notify_change(&file->f_path, &newattrs);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
