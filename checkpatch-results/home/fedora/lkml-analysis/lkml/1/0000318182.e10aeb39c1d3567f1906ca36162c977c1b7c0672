#35: 
page_file_index - gives the offset of this page in the file in PAGE_CACHE_SIZE

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:603:
+extern struct address_space *__page_file_mapping(struct page *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+extern pgoff_t __page_file_index(struct page *page);

#129: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:1834:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
