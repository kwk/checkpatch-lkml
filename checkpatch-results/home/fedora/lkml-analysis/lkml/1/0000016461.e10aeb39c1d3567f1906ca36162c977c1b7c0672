CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#76: FILE: drivers/staging/p9auth/p9auth.c:293:
+				new->suid = new->fsuid = new->euid = new->uid;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
