WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config TOUCHSCREEN_USB_IDEALTEK

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 128 exceeds 100 columns
#86: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/usbtouchscreen.c:96:
+#if defined(CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_USB_EGALAX) || defined(CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_USB_ETURBO) || defined(CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_USB_IDEALTEK)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#144: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/usbtouchscreen.c:478:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
