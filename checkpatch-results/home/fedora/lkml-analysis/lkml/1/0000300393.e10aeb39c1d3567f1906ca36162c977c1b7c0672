This patch depends on patch 1/3 "accounting: task counters for disk/network".

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#65: FILE: include/linux/acct.h:101:
+struct acct_v6 {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#110: FILE: include/linux/acct.h:146:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#177: FILE: kernel/acct.c:512:
+	ac.ac_bread  = ac.ac_bwrite = ac.ac_dskrsz = ac.ac_dskwsz = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
