#27: 
Driver will call cmd completion routine from Reset path without waiting for cmd completion from isr context.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#86: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c:925:
+		if (consumer == (instance->max_fw_cmds + 1)) {
+			consumer = 0;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
