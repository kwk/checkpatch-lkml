ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#139: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_events.c:1173:
+static struct ftrace_ops trace_ops __initdata  =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#158: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_events.c:1192:
+{

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
