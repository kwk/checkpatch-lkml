CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#177: FILE: include/linux/cred.h:155:
+extern struct cred *cred_alloc_blank(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*tsec)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct task_security_struct)...)
#688: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:3219:
+	tsec = kzalloc(sizeof(struct task_security_struct), gfp);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
