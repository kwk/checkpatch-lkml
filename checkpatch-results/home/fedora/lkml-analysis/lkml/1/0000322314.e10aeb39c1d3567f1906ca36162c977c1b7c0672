CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#233: FILE: drivers/scsi/ses.c:535:
+	page7_len = len = (hdr_buf[2] << 8) + hdr_buf[3] + 4;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
