Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#100: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:424:
+extern void genhd_media_change_notify(struct gendisk *disk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
