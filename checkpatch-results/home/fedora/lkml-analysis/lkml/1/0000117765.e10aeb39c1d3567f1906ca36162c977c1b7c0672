WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct block_device_operations should normally be const
#90: FILE: fs/partitions/check.c:574:
+			struct block_device_operations *bdops = disk->fops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct gendisk *' should also have an identifier name
#132: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:1224:
+	unsigned long long (*set_capacity) (struct gendisk *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
