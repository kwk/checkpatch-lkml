#16: 
Subject: [PATCH 08/49] ext4:  Fix sparse warnings.

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
