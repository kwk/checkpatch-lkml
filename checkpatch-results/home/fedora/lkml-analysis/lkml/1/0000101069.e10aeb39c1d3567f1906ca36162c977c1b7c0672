Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
