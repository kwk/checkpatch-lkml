ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#51: FILE: drivers/acpi/bus.c:284:
+int event_is_open = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#64: FILE: drivers/acpi/event.c:20:
+extern int event_is_open;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
