CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!skp"
#159: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:1375:
+	if (skp == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*isp)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ipc_smack)...)
#178: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:1498:
+	isp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ipc_smack), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
