ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#72: 
--- a/include/linux/cpu.h~linux-sysdevh-needs-to-include-linux-moduleh-up-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#80: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:46:
+extern int sched_create_sysfs_power_savings_entries(struct sysdev_class *cls);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
