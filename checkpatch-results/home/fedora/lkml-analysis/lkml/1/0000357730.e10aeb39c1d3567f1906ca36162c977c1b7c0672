WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 125 exceeds 100 columns
#56: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1175:
+	int (*mmap_prepare) (struct file *, unsigned long len, unsigned long prot, unsigned long flags, unsigned long pgoff);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#56: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1175:
+	int (*mmap_prepare) (struct file *, unsigned long len, unsigned long prot, unsigned long flags, unsigned long pgoff);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#56: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1175:
+	int (*mmap_prepare) (struct file *, unsigned long len, unsigned long prot, unsigned long flags, unsigned long pgoff);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
