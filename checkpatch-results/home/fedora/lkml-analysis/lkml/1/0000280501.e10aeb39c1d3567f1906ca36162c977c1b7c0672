WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#78: FILE: arch/powerpc/mm/hugetlbpage.c:320:
+		BUG_ON(get_slice_psize(tlb->mm, addr) != mmu_huge_psize);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
