WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#47: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#48: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:2:
+ * FILE NAME fs/pramfs/dir.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#86: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:40:
+	dir->i_mtime = dir->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#107: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:61:
+		pidir->i_type.dir.head = pidir->i_type.dir.tail = inode->i_ino;

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#113: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:67:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#151: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:105:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#182: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:136:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#200: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:154:
+pram_readdir(struct file *filp, void *dirent, filldir_t filldir)
                           ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#230: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:184:

#244: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:198:

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#248: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:202:
+	if (pi) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '>>' (ctx:VxV)
#254: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:208:
+			      dtype_by_mode[(pi->i_mode & S_IFMT)>>S_SHIFT]);
 			                                         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#256: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:210:

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#262: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:216:
+struct file_operations pram_dir_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#263: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:217:
+^I.read ^I^I= generic_read_dir,$

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#265: FILE: fs/pramfs/dir.c:219:
+^I.fsync^I^I= simple_sync_file,^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
