Subject: [PATCH 05/11] ext3: Allocate space for mmaped file on page fault
                                                ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#26: 
So far we've allocated space at ->writepage() time. This has the disadvantage

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#46: FILE: fs/ext3/file.c:113:
+static struct vm_operations_struct ext3_file_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#239: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1496:
+static int ext3_common_writepage(struct page *page,
 				struct writeback_control *wbc)

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'page->mapping != inode->i_mapping'
#320: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1706:
+	if ((page->mapping != inode->i_mapping) ||
+	    (page_offset(page) > size)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#419: FILE: include/linux/ext3_fs.h:895:
+extern int ext3_page_mkwrite(struct vm_area_struct *vma, struct vm_fault *vmf);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
