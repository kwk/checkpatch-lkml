WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#248: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:196:
+	unsigned long flags;
+	unsigned int uninitialized_var(msecs);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#248: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:196:
+	unsigned int uninitialized_var(msecs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'msecs' should also have an identifier name
#248: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:196:
+	unsigned int uninitialized_var(msecs);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_INT: Prefer 'long' over 'long int' as the int is unnecessary
#288: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:236:
+	long int input;

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#292: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:240:
+	rc = strict_strtol(buf, 10, &input);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'ata_scsi_park_show' to 'unload_heads_show' 'ata_scsi_park_store' to 'unload_heads_store'
#333: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:281:
+}

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#334: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:282:
+DEVICE_ATTR(unload_heads, S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
