Subject: [PATCH try #2] Input/Joystick Driver: add support AD7142 joystick driver

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#58: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/Kconfig:285:
+config JOYSTICK_AD7142
+         tristate "Analog Devices AD7142 Joystick support"
+         depends on BFIN && I2C
+         help
+           Say Y here if you want to support an AD7142 joystick

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

#94: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/ad7142.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#119: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/ad7142.c:27:
+ * If not, write to the Free Software Foundation,$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*client)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_client)...)
#257: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/ad7142.c:165:
+	client = kmalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_client), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
