ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#109: FILE: include/linux/rmap.h:138:
+extern void emm_notifier_unregister(struct emm_notifier *e,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#110: FILE: include/linux/rmap.h:139:
+extern void emm_notifier_unregister(struct emm_notifier *e,
+					struct mm_struct *mm);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#147: FILE: mm/rmap.c:317:
+	if (e == p)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
