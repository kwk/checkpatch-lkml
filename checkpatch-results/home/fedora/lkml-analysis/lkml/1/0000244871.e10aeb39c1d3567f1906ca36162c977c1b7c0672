commit d1f114d12bb4db3147e1b1342ae31083c5a79c84 upstream

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#73: FILE: drivers/usb/host/ehci.h:101:
+	unsigned long		port_c_suspend;		/* which ports have
+			the change-suspend feature turned on */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
