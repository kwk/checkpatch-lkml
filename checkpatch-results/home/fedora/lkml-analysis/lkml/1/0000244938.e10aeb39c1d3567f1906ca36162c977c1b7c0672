CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*chip)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_irqchip)...)
#53: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:1631:
+	struct kvm_irqchip *chip = kmalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_irqchip), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SIZEOF_PARENTHESIS: sizeof u.ps should be sizeof(u.ps)
