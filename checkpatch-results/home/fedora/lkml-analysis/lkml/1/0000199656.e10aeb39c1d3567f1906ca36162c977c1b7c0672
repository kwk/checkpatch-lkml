WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#27: 
ifa_local is assumed to be unsigned long which lead to writing the address at dev->dev_addr-2 instead of +2

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 133 exceeds 100 columns
#54: FILE: drivers/isdn/hysdn/hysdn_net.c:91:
+				memcpy(dev->dev_addr + (ETH_ALEN - sizeof(ifa->ifa_local)), &ifa->ifa_local, sizeof(ifa->ifa_local));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
