#29: 
don't want drivers having their own huge arrays for per IRQ data so use a hash

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#56: FILE: drivers/serial/68328serial.c:377:
+	struct m68k_serial * info = dev_id;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!i->head"
#133: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1544:
+	if (i->head == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!n"
#157: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1567:
+	if (n == NULL) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*i)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct irq_info)...)
#158: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1568:
+		i = kzalloc(sizeof(struct irq_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!i"
#159: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1569:

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#192: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1616:
+	BUG_ON(n == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
