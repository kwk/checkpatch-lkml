#29: 
confusing "function calls" corresponding to stack values that look like they

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#50: FILE: arch/microblaze/Kconfig.debug:29:
+config FRAME_POINTER
+	bool "Use frame pointers"
+	default n
+	help
+	  If you say N here, the resulting kernel will be slightly smaller and
+	  faster. However, stack dumps will be much harder to interpret.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#85: FILE: arch/microblaze/kernel/traps.c:62:
+		stack = (unsigned long *) stack[7];

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
