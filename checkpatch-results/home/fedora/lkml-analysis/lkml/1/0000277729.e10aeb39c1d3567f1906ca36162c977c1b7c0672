WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#101: FILE: drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-irq.c:447:
+	memcpy(s->sg_processing, s->sg_pending, sizeof(struct ivtv_sg_host_element) * s->sg_pending_size);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SGsize>
#123: FILE: drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-queue.c:196:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
