WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#132: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/sdio_io.c:171:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(sdio_set_block_size);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#165: FILE: include/linux/mmc/sdio_func.h:115:
+extern int sdio_set_block_size(struct sdio_func *func, unsigned short blksz);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
