Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#126: FILE: fs/ext4/ialloc.c:602:
+	 * table then we need to initialize up to this inode. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#128: FILE: fs/ext4/ialloc.c:604:
+	if (EXT4_HAS_RO_COMPAT_FEATURE(sb, EXT4_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_GDT_CSUM)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
