WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#504: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/include/mach/clockdomain.h:2:
+ * arch/arm/plat-omap/include/mach/clockdomain.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
