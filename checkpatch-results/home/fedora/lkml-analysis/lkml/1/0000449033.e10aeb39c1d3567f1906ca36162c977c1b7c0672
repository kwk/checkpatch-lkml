ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#91: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:299:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
