WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'autofs_hash_insert', this function's name, in a string

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'autofs_hash_enum', this function's name, in a string
#103: FILE: fs/autofs/dirhash.c:182:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
