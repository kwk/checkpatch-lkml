CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#135: FILE: include/linux/ptrace.h:104:
+extern int ptrace_access_check(struct task_struct *task, unsigned int mode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
