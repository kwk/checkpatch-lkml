#47: 
    Previously we used a table of size PCI_BUS_NUM_RESOURCES (16) for resources

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#73: FILE: arch/ia64/pci/pci.c:320:
 static void __devinit

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*bus_res)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pci_bus_resource)...)
#220: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:25:
+	bus_res = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pci_bus_resource), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
