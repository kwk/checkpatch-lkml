#39: 
otg_is_usb_online is probably too simple, I'm just using this with a peripheral

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#96: FILE: drivers/power/pda_power.c:115:
+	static int regulator_enabled = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <ac_max_uA>
#97: FILE: drivers/power/pda_power.c:116:
+	int max_uA = pdata->ac_max_uA;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
