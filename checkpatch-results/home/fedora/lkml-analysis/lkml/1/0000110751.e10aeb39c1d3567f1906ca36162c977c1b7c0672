CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#88: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-annotate.c:89:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#121: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-annotate.c:1096:
+		if (sym_ext) {
[...]
+		} else if (sym->hist_sum)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
