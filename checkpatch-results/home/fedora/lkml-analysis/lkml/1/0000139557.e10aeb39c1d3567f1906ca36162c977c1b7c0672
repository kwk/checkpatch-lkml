CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!current->mm"
#233: FILE: security/security.c:201:
+	WARN_ON(current->mm == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mm"
#239: FILE: security/security.c:207:
+	WARN_ON(mm == NULL);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#246: FILE: security/security.c:214:
+	/* If current->mm is a kernel thread then we will pass NULL,
+	   for this specific case that is fine */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting
