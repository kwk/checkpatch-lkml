CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'val >= 0'

+		if ((val >= 0) && ((val & BMCR_RESET) == 0))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#115: FILE: drivers/net/ibm_emac/ibm_emac_phy.c:59:

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
