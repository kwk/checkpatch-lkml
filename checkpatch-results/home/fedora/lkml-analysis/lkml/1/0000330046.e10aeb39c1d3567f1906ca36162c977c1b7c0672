Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#74: FILE: include/linux/proportions.h:84:
+#define PROP_MAX_SHIFT (3*BITS_PER_LONG/4)
                                        ^

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#77: FILE: include/linux/proportions.h:87:
+#define PROP_FRAC_BASE		(1UL << PROP_FRAC_SHIFT)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#82: FILE: include/linux/proportions.h:92:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#152: FILE: mm/backing-dev.c:72:
+static ssize_t max_ratio_store(struct device *dev,
+		struct device_attribute *attr, const char *buf, size_t count)

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#159: FILE: mm/backing-dev.c:79:
+	ratio = simple_strtoul(buf, &end, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
