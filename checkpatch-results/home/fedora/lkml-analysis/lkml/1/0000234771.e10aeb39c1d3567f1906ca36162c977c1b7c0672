WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#124: FILE: security/commoncap.c:487:
+	if (old_euid == 0 && euid != 0) {
 		cap_clear (current->cap_effective);
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
