#18: 
Subject: [PATCH -tip] v3 Consolidate sparse and lockdep declarations in include/linux/rcupdate.h

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#153: FILE: include/linux/rcupreempt.h:67:
+extern void __rcu_read_lock(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
