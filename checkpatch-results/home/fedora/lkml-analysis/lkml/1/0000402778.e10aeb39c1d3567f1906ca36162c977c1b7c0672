ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#105: 
--- a/drivers/pcmcia/electra_cf.c~pcmcia-compactflash-driver-for-pa-semi-electra-boards-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct of_device_id should normally be const
#124: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/electra_cf.c:341:
+static struct of_device_id electra_cf_match[] = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
