CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: arch/blackfin/include/asm/cacheflush.h:40:
+extern void blackfin_invalidate_entire_icache(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
