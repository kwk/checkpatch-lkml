Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#169: FILE: include/asm-s390/sysinfo.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#244: FILE: include/asm-s390/sysinfo.h:76:
+#define LPAR_CHAR_DEDICATED	(1 << 7)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#245: FILE: include/asm-s390/sysinfo.h:77:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'stsi', this function's name, in a string
#271: FILE: include/asm-s390/sysinfo.h:103:
+		"   stsi 0(%2)\n"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#276: FILE: include/asm-s390/sysinfo.h:108:
+		: "+d" (r0) : "d" (r1), "a" (sysinfo), "K" (-ENOSYS)

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
