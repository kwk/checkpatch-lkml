+}

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#241: FILE: drivers/regulator/core.c:1500:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
