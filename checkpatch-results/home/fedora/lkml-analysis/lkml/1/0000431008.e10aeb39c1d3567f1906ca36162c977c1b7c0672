ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#44: FILE: arch/um/include/sysdep-x86_64/kernel-offsets.h:23:
+#define __SYSCALL(nr, sym) [nr] = 1,

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

                                                ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
