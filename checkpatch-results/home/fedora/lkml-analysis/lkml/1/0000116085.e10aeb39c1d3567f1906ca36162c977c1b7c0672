ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#105: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:760:
+static unsigned long total = 0, total_mmap = 0, total_comm = 0, total_unknown = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#252: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:886:
+	uint32_t size;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!getcwd"
#279: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:913:
+		if (getcwd(__cwd, sizeof(__cwd)) == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#318: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-report.c:952:
+	if (!size || process_event(event, offset, head) < 0) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
