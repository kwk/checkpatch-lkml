#263: FILE: arch/powerpc/mm/pgtable_32.c:68:
+extern phys_addr_t v_mapped_by_tlbcam(unsigned long va);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns

+/*190*/	.word sys32_init_module, sys_sparc64_personality, sys_remap_file_pages, sys32_epoll_create, sys32_epoll_ctl

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#734: FILE: drivers/net/tun.c:161:
+	 * unicast will leave the filter disabled. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#1094: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:1286:
+	if (linear) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

#1404: FILE: net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1135:
+			if (unlikely(np->cork.opt == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:WxV)
#1474: FILE: net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_icmpv6.c:53:

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#1592: FILE: net/sctp/output.c:327:
+		if (SCTP_XMIT_OK != retval)

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.
