Subject: [PATCH]procfs: Fix checkpatch.pl errors in generic.c

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO | S_IXUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0777'.
#331: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:654:
+			  (S_IFLNK | S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO | S_IXUGO), 1);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
