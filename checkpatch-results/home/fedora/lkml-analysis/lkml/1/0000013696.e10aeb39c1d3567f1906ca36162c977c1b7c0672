#215: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/52xx/mpc52xx_gpt.c:406:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#272: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/52xx/mpc52xx_gpt.c:463:
+static void
+mpc52xx_gpt_pwm_setup(struct mpc52xx_gpt_priv *p, struct device_node *np) {}

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
