Some 'extern struct seq_operations' are wrongly defined in fs/proc/proc_misc.c

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#145: FILE: include/linux/seq_file.h:70:
+extern struct seq_operations diskstats_op;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
