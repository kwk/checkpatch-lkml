Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#75: FILE: arch/x86/pci/i386.c:318:
+static struct vm_operations_struct pci_mmap_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
