WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#77: FILE: drivers/ata/Kconfig:275:
+config PATA_CS5536
+	tristate "CS5536 PATA support (Experimental)"
+	depends on PCI && X86 && !X86_64 && EXPERIMENTAL
+	help
+	  This option enables support for the AMD CS5536
+	  companion chip used with the Geode LX processor family.

+	  If unsure, say N.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#171: FILE: drivers/ata/ata_piix.c:589:
+	[ich9_2port_sata] =
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#200: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:4017:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#260: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_cs5536.c:15:

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
