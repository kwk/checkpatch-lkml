Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv.h:121:
+extern irqreturn_t aer_irq(int irq, void *context);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
