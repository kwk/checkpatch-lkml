vread()/vwrite() is only called from kcore/kmem to access one page at a time.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#226: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:1680:
+	BUG_ON(count > PAGE_SIZE - offset);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#407: FILE: include/linux/vmalloc.h:108:
+extern int vread_page(char *buf, char *addr, unsigned int count);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
