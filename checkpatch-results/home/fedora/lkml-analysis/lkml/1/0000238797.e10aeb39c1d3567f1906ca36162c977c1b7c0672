CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#60: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/apic_32.c:1780:
+	if (strcmp("debug", arg) == 0)
[...]
-	else if (strcmp(arg, "verbose") == 0)
[...]
 		apic_verbosity = APIC_VERBOSE;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
