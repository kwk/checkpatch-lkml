WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#78: FILE: drivers/leds/Kconfig:99:

+	  This option enables support for LEDs on keyboards handled by

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#101: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#106: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-input.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#115: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-input.c:10:
+ * ^I^I     $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

#147: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-input.c:42:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#158: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-input.c:53:
+^I^I        unsigned int code, int down)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*blinker)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct blinker)...)
#174: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-input.c:69:
+	blinker = kzalloc(sizeof(struct blinker), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#175: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-input.c:70:
+	if (!blinker) {
+		return -ENOMEM;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
