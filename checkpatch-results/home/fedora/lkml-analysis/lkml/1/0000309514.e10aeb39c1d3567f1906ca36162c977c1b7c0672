CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:2065:
+extern struct task_group *sched_create_group(struct task_group *parent);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#66: FILE: kernel/sched.c:7277:
+static void init_tg_cfs_entry(struct task_group *tg, struct cfs_rq *cfs_rq,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
