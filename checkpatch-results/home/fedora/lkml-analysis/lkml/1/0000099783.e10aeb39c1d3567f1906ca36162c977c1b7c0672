Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#86: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-report.c:377:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct hist_entry *' should also have an identifier name
#101: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-report.c:554:
+	size_t	(*print)(FILE *fp, struct hist_entry *, unsigned int width);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#225: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-report.c:1019:

+		if (slen > dsos__longest_name)
