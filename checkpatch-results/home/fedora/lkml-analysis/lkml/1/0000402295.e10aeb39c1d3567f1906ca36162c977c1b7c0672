CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#131: FILE: Documentation/lguest/lguest.c:646:
+				descs[i].pfn = top/getpagesize();
 				                  ^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#132: FILE: Documentation/lguest/lguest.c:647:
+				top += num_pages*getpagesize();
 				                ^

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#199: FILE: Documentation/lguest/lguest.c:930:
+			mem = top = atoi(argv[i]) * 1024 * 1024;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
