WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 120 exceeds 100 columns
#98: FILE: lib/vsprintf.c:584:
+static char *resource_size_string(char *buf, char *end, resource_size_t *val, int field_width, int precision, int flags)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
