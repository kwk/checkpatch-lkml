WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pipe_buf_operations should normally be const
#226: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:3128:
+static struct pipe_buf_operations buffer_pipe_buf_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#278: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:3180:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#364: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:3718:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#376: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:3730:
+				pr_warning("Could not create debugfs buffers "
+					   "'%s' entry\n", buf);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
