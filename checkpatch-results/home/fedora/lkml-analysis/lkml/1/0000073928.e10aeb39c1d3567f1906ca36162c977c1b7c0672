Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#198: FILE: arch/sparc/mm/init_64.c:1926:
+	extern unsigned int valid_addr_bitmap_insn[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#241: FILE: arch/sparc/mm/init_64.c:1955:
+		int i;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#257: FILE: arch/sparc/mm/init_64.h:8:
+#define MAX_PHYS_ADDRESS	(1UL << 41UL)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
