CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#90: FILE: drivers/md/dm-snap.c:339:
+		if (active) {
[...]
+		} else if (snap_dest)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#112: FILE: drivers/md/dm-snap.c:361:
+		snap->ti->error = "Snapshot cow pairing for exception "
+				  "table handover failed";

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 's == snap_src'
#340: FILE: drivers/md/dm-snap.c:931:
+	if (snap_src && snap_dest && (s == snap_src)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
