#32: 
- convert UDF_SB_ALLOC_PARTMAPS macro to udf_sb_alloc_partition_maps function

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#64: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:233:
+	struct udf_sb_info *sbi = UDF_SB(sb);
+	sbi->s_partmaps = kzalloc(sizeof(struct udf_part_map) * count, GFP_KERNEL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*sbi->s_partmaps)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct udf_part_map)...)
#64: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:233:
+	sbi->s_partmaps = kzalloc(sizeof(struct udf_part_map) * count, GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#64: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:233:
+	sbi->s_partmaps = kzalloc(sizeof(struct udf_part_map) * count, GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#65: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:234:
+	if (sbi->s_partmaps != NULL)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "sbi->s_partmaps"
#65: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:234:
+	if (sbi->s_partmaps != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#67: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:236:
+	else {

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#69: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:238:
+		udf_error(sb, __FUNCTION__, "Unable to allocate space for %d partition maps", count);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#69: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:238:
+		udf_error(sb, __FUNCTION__, "Unable to allocate space for %d partition maps", count);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "sbi->s_partmaps"
#71: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:240:
+	return sbi->s_partmaps != NULL ? 0 : -ENOMEM;

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <numPartitionMaps>
#82: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:1054:
+	i = udf_sb_alloc_partition_maps(sb, le32_to_cpu(lvd->numPartitionMaps));

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
