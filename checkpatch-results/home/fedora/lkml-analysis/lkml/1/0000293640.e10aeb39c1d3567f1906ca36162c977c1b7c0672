Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'serial8250_interrupt', this function's name, in a string
#128: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1461:
+	DEBUG_INTR("serial8250_interrupt...");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#137: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1500:
 			printk(KERN_ERR "serial8250: too much work for "
+				"irq%d\n", up->port.irq);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
