#73: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:227:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#73: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:227:
+	const u8 *d = (u8*) dm + 5;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#82: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:236:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "dmi_save_extended_devices: out of memory.\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dmi_save_extended_devices', this function's name, in a string
#82: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:236:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "dmi_save_extended_devices: out of memory.\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
