CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/biotrack.h:52:
+extern int blkio_cgroup_register_ioband(const struct ioband_cgroup_ops *ops);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+static DEFINE_MUTEX(ioband_ops_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#391: FILE: drivers/md/dm-ioband-ctl.c:278:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#632: FILE: drivers/md/dm-ioband.h:63:

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
