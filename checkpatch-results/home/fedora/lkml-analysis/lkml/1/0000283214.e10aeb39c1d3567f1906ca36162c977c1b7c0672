commit 21a75d7788f4e29b6c6d28e08f9f0310c4de828d upstream.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#66: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43/b43.h:633:
+	 * might sync with TX by write_lock_irqsave()'ing. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
