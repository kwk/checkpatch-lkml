ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#221: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_hpt366.c:384:
 	switch((reg1 & 0x700) >> 8) {
+		case 9:
[...]
+		case 5:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
