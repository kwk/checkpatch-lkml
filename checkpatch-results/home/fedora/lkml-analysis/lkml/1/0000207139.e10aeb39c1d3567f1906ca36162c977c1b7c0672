The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#77: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_pci.c:741:
+ * Check that device is part of the Tornado range of devices, then $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#81: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_pci.c:745:
+static int pci_oxsemi_tornado_init(struct pci_dev *dev) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <deviceID>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p"
#92: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_pci.c:756:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#103: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_pci.c:766:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
