WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'lmc_ioctl', this function's name, in a string
#153: FILE: drivers/net/wan/lmc/lmc_main.c:635:
+	lmc_trace(dev, "lmc_ioctl out");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
