WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#48: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#53: FILE: extensions/libxt_ipvs.c:1:
+/* Shared library add-on to iptables to add ipvs matching.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#72: FILE: extensions/libxt_ipvs.c:20:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u8' over 'u_int8_t'
#134: FILE: extensions/libxt_ipvs.c:82:

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#136: FILE: extensions/libxt_ipvs.c:84:
+	if ('0' <= c && c <= '5') {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#146: FILE: extensions/libxt_ipvs.c:94:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#210: FILE: extensions/libxt_ipvs.c:158:
+				      "! --ipvs can not be together with"
+				      " other options");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
