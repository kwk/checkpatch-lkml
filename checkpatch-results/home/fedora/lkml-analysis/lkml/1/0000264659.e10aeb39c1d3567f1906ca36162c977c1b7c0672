WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#115: FILE: fs/proc/inode.c:319:
+	int (*release)(struct inode *, struct file *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*pdeo)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct pde_opener)...)
#128: FILE: fs/proc/inode.c:332:
+	pdeo = kmalloc(sizeof(struct pde_opener), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#148: FILE: fs/proc/inode.c:351:
+	if (rv == 0) {
[...]
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
