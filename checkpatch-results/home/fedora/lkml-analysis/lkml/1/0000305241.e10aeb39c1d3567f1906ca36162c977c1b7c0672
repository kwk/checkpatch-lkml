                         ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#48: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/e820_64.c:241:
+	struct resource *res;
+	res = alloc_bootmem_low(sizeof(struct resource) * e820.nr_map);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
