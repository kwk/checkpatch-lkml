ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#72: FILE: workqueue.c:577:
+struct xxx

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
