#31: 
Move reset_lazy_tlbstate into tlb_32.c, and define noop versions of play_dead in process_{32,64}.c when !CONFIG_SMP

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#71: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/process_32.c:80:
+	BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
