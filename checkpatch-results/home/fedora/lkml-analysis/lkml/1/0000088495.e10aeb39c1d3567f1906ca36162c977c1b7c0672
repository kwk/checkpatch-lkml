CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#105: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c:224:
+	shadow_accessed_shift
+		= find_first_bit((void *)&shadow_accessed_mask, 64);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#115: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c:823:
+		BUG_ON(!(_spte & shadow_accessed_mask));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#143: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c:4033:
+		kvm_mmu_set_mask_ptes(0ull, 1ull << 63, 0ull, 0ull,
 				VMX_EPT_EXECUTABLE_MASK);
