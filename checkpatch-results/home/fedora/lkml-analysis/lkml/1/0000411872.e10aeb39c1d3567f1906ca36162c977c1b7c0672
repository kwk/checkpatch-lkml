#29: 
The HPT36x chips finally turned out to have the channel enable bits -- however,

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#49: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c		Version 1.06	Jun 27, 2007

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#66: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1523:
+	d->enablebits[0].mask = d->enablebits[0].val = 0x10;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#70: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1526:
+^I  ^Iu8  mcr1 = 0, pin1 = 0, pin2 = 0;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#70: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1526:
