Andrew, I like this patch but know that there are many types of memory layout. 

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#71: 
Signed-Off-By: KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'idx == target'
#139: FILE: include/linux/mmzone.h:546:
+	if (is_configured_zone(target) && (idx == target))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
