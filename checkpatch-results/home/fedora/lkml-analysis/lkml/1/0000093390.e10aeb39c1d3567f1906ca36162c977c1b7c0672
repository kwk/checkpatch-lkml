ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#116: FILE: drivers/staging/otus/80211core/cmm.c:1101:
             if ((wd->sta.capability[1] & ZM_BIT_0) == 1)
+            {   //spectrum management flag enable

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#118: FILE: drivers/staging/otus/80211core/cmm.c:1102:
+            {   //spectrum management flag enable$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
