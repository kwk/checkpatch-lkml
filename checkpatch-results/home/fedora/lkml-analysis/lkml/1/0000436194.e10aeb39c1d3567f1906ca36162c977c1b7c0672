The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#89: FILE: arch/m68knommu/kernel/irq.c:2:
+ * arch/m68knommu/kernel/irq.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#121: FILE: arch/m68knommu/kernel/irq.c:34:

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#148: FILE: arch/m68knommu/kernel/irq.c:61:
+	int irq = *((loff_t *) v);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
