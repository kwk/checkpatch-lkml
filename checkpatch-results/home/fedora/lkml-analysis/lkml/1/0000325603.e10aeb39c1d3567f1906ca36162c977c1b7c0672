Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#75: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c:405:
+		struct sched_param schedparm;
+		schedparm.sched_priority = 99;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
