ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#118: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/kprobes.c:595:
notifier_block *self,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#127: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/kprobes.c:601:
+		 * be non-preemptible. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
