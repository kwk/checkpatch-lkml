#47: 
I tried out several main-stream sd-cards and with the Atmel (AP7) controller

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#89: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:1040:
+	unsigned freqs[] = { 400000, 300000, 200000, 100000 };

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#111: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:1080:
+		printk ("mmc_rescan: trying %u Hz\n", host->f_init);

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#111: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:1080:
+		printk ("mmc_rescan: trying %u Hz\n", host->f_init);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'mmc_rescan', this function's name, in a string
#111: FILE: drivers/mmc/core/core.c:1080:
+		printk ("mmc_rescan: trying %u Hz\n", host->f_init);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
