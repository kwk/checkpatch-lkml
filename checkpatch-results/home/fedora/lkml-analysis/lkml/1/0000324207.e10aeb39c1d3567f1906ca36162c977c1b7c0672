CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'device_type == 5'
#102: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:1261:
+	if ((device_type == 5) &&
+		trstr(id->model, "CD-ROM") &&
+		strstr(id->model, "ZIP"))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#103: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:1262:

+		trstr(id->model, "CD-ROM") &&

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#109: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:1267:
+	if (protocol != 2)
[...]
-	else if (gcw.device_type != 0)
[...]
 		printk(KERN_ERR "ide-floppy: Device type (0x%02x) is not set "
[...]
-		printk(KERN_ERR "ide-floppy: The removable flag is not set\n");
[...]
+	else if (!removable)
[...]
+	else if (drq_type == 3) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
