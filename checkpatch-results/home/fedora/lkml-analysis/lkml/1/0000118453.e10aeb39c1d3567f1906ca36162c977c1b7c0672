CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#95: FILE: Documentation/perf_counter/builtin-stat.c:135:
+	count[0] = count[1] = count[2] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited before that '++' (ctx:WxB)
