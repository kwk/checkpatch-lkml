WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#148: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#153: FILE: security/selinux/include/audit.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#156: FILE: security/selinux/include/audit.h:4:
+ * Most of below header was moved from include/linux/selinux.h which $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'operater' may be misspelled - perhaps 'operator'?
#176: FILE: security/selinux/include/audit.h:24:
+ *	@op: the operater the rule uses
   	         ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#207: FILE: security/selinux/include/audit.h:55:
+                             struct audit_context *actx);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#207: FILE: security/selinux/include/audit.h:55:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#296: FILE: security/selinux/ss/services.c:2385:
+		struct audit_field *f = &rule->fields[i];
+		switch (f->type) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#425: FILE: include/linux/audit.h:566:
+extern int		    audit_update_lsm_rules(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
