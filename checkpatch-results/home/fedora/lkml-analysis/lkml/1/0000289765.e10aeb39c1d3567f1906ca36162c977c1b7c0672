Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!d"
#1483: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1517:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*merge_bh)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct idetape_bh)...)
#2108: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1305:
+	merge_bh = kmalloc(sizeof(struct idetape_bh), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
