#31: 
This patch converts SLUB early-boot code to use GFP_PANIC instead of explicit

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#63: FILE: mm/slub.c:4371:
+	p = name = kmalloc(ID_STR_LENGTH, GFP_KERNEL | GFP_PANIC);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
