CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#101: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1677:
+	bh = head = page_buffers(page);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#107: FILE: fs/ext4/inode.c:1683:
+	disksize = ((loff_t) block) << inode->i_blkbits;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
