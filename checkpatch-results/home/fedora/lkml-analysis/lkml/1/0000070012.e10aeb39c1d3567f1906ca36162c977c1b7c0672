WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#74: FILE: drivers/char/vt_ioctl.c:1506:
+		 * we don't want to mess the screen for now. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/linux/vt_kern.h:120:
+extern int vt_move_to_console(unsigned int vt, int alloc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
