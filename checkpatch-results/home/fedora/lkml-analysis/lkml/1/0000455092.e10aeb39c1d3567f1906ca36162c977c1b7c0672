WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#37: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/io_edgeport.c:114:

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+	if (!edge_port->open || edge_port->closePending) {
 		return;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#371: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/io_edgeport.c:2342:
+	wait_event (&edge_port->wait_command, !edge_port->commandPending);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#407: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/io_edgeport.c:2939:
+		interrupt_in_found = bulk_in_found = bulk_out_found = false;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
