+	 * immediately after soft reset causes bus error. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
