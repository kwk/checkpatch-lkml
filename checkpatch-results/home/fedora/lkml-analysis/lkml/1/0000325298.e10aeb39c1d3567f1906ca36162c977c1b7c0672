WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#60: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#65: FILE: Documentation/controllers/example.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#66: FILE: Documentation/controllers/example.c:2:
+ * Documentation/controllers/example.c - A simple controller

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#117: FILE: Documentation/controllers/example.c:53:
+static ssize_t foo_bar_read(struct cgroup *cg, struct cftype *cft,
+		struct file *file, char __user *userbuf,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#132: FILE: Documentation/controllers/example.c:68:
+static ssize_t foo_bar_write(struct cgroup *cg, struct cftype *cft,
+		struct file *file, const char __user *userbuf,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#159: FILE: Documentation/controllers/example.c:95:
+static struct cgroup_subsys_state *foo_create(struct cgroup_subsys *cs,
+		struct cgroup *cg)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*foo)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct foo_cgroup)...)
#163: FILE: Documentation/controllers/example.c:99:
+	foo = kmalloc(sizeof(struct foo_cgroup), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!foo"
#164: FILE: Documentation/controllers/example.c:100:
+	if (foo == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
