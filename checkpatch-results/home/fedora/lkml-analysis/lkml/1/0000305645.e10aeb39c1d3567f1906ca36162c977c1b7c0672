WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <cFYI>
#130: FILE: fs/cifs/cifssmb.c:1159:
+		cFYI(1, ("unknown disposition %d", disposition));

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#167: FILE: fs/cifs/ioctl.c:68:
+		if (cifs_sb->mnt_uid == current->uid)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#169: FILE: fs/cifs/ioctl.c:70:
+		else {

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <pSMBFile>
#189: FILE: fs/cifs/ioctl.c:78:
+			if (pSMBFile == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pSMBFile"
#189: FILE: fs/cifs/ioctl.c:78:
+			if (pSMBFile == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <CIFSGetExtAttr>
#191: FILE: fs/cifs/ioctl.c:80:
+			rc = CIFSGetExtAttr(xid, tcon, pSMBFile->netfid,

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <ExtAttrBits>
#192: FILE: fs/cifs/ioctl.c:81:
+					    &ExtAttrBits, &ExtAttrMask);

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <ExtAttrMask>
#192: FILE: fs/cifs/ioctl.c:81:
+					    &ExtAttrBits, &ExtAttrMask);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pSMBFile"
#218: FILE: fs/cifs/ioctl.c:95:
+			if (pSMBFile == NULL)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#221: FILE: fs/cifs/ioctl.c:98:
+			/* rc= CIFSGetExtAttr(xid,tcon,pSMBFile->netfid,
+					      extAttrBits, &ExtAttrMask);*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
