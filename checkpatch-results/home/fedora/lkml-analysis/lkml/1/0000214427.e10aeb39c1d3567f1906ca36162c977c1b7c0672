Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#87: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:1927:
 static void __devinit pci_no_domains(void)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#98: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:169:
+extern int pci_resource_alignment(struct pci_dev *dev, int resno);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#152: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-res.c:240:
+				align = pci_resource_alignment(ln->dev,
+						ln->res - ln->dev->resource);
