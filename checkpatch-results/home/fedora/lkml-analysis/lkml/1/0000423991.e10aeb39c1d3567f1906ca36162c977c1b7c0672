ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#70: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mcheck/therm_throt.c:133:
thermal_throttle_cpu_callback(struct notifier_block *nfb,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#239: FILE: include/linux/notifier.h:200:
+^I^I^I^I        * not handling interrupts, soon dead */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#239: FILE: include/linux/notifier.h:200:
+				        * not handling interrupts, soon dead */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#377: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:673:
+	if (this_cpu == cpu) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
