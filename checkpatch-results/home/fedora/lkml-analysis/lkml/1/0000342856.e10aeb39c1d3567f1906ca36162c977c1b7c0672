WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#85: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:395:
+	BUG_ON(!valid && dentry->d_inode);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LIKELY_MISUSE: nested (un)?likely() calls, IS_ERR already uses unlikely() internally
#130: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:418:
+		if (unlikely(IS_ERR(name))) {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#203: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:456:
+				struct inode *inode = lower_dir_dentry->d_inode;
+				err = inode->i_op->unlink(inode, wh_dentry);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#206: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:459:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "unionfs: symlink: could not "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#207: FILE: fs/unionfs/inode.c:460:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "unionfs: symlink: could not "
+				       "unlink whiteout, err = %d\n", err);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
