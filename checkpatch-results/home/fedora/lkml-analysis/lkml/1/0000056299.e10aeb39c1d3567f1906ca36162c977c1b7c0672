Since this is always __ratelimit, this wont help much.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#83: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:243:
+extern int __printk_ratelimit(const char *func);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTK_RATELIMITED: Prefer printk_ratelimited or pr_<level>_ratelimited to printk_ratelimit
#84: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:244:
+#define printk_ratelimit() __printk_ratelimit(__func__)
