Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

+               if (f == NULL &&

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

#54: FILE: fs/utimes.c:109:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
