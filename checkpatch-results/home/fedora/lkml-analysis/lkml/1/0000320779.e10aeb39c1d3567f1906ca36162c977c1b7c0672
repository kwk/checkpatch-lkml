CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#73: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:441:
+extern __u32 cookie_init_timestamp(struct request_sock *req);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#121: FILE: net/ipv4/syncookies.c:166:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
