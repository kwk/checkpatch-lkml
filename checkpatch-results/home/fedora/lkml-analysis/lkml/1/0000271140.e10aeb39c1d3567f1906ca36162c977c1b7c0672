WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#115: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:116:
+	VM_BUG_ON(!in_atomic());

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#244: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:618:
+				if (put_page_testzero(page))
[...]
+				else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
