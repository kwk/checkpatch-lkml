patch that adds a "swapon" funciton to struct block_device_operations
                           ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#63: 
Currently, we have "swap discard" mechanism which sends a discard bio request

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct block_device *' should also have an identifier name
#109: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:1243:
+	int (*swapon)(struct block_device *, struct swap_info_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct swap_info_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#109: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:1243:
+	int (*swapon)(struct block_device *, struct swap_info_struct *);
