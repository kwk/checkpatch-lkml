ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#79: 
--- a/include/linux/uaccess.h~uaccess-fix-parameters-inversion-for-__copy_from_user_inatomic

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 129 exceeds 100 columns
#86: FILE: include/linux/uaccess.h:81:
+		ret = __copy_from_user_inatomic(&(retval), (__force typeof(retval) __user *)(addr), sizeof(retval));		\

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
