ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#380: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:678:
+^I^I^I        val, (int)saved_val);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#492: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:1468:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(pcim_activate_device);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#503: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.h:3:
+extern int pcim_activation_used(struct pci_dev *pdev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
