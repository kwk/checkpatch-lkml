Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#192: FILE: kernel/power/main.c:237:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#327: FILE: drivers/base/power/runtime.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#328: FILE: drivers/base/power/runtime.c:2:
+ * drivers/base/power/runtime.c - Helper functions for device run-time PM

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#513: FILE: drivers/base/power/runtime.c:187:
+	} else if (dev->power.runtime_status != RPM_SUSPENDING

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#540: FILE: drivers/base/power/runtime.c:214:
+	if (dev->power.runtime_status == RPM_ACTIVE) {
+		goto out;
+	} if (dev->power.runtime_status == RPM_IDLE) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line (or did you mean 'else if'?)
#542: FILE: drivers/base/power/runtime.c:216:
+	} if (dev->power.runtime_status == RPM_IDLE) {

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#694: FILE: include/linux/pm_runtime.h:45:

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
