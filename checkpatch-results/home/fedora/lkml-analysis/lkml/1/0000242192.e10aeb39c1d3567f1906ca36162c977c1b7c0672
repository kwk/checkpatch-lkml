CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!i->head"
#125: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1557:
+	if (i->head == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!n"
#149: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1580:
+	if (n == NULL) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*i)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct irq_info)...)
#150: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1581:
+		i = kzalloc(sizeof(struct irq_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!i"
#151: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1582:
+		if (i == NULL) {

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#183: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1629:
+	BUG_ON(n == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
