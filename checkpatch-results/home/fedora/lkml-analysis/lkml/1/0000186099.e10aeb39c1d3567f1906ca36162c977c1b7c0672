#93: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/bug.h:36:
+extern void early_bug(char *file, int line) __attribute__((noreturn));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#135: FILE: include/linux/bug.h:52:
+#define EARLY_BUG_ON(x) BUG_ON(x)

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
