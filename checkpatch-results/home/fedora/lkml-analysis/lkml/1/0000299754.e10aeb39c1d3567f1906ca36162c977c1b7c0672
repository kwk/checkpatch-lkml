WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#99: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:198:
+ * find an existing css_set */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#101: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:200:
+#define CSS_SET_TABLE_SIZE	(1 << CSS_SET_HASH_BITS)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
