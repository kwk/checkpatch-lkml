WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct xpc_rsvd_page *' should also have an identifier name
#136: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc.h:641:
+extern enum xp_retval (*xpc_rsvd_page_init) (struct xpc_rsvd_page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#139: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc.h:644:
+extern void xpc_init_sn2(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#214: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc_partition.c:171:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
