loop forver under certain conditions. Does one of the checks hit ?
     ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#82: FILE: kernel/time/tick-broadcast.c:376:
+	static int once = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#86: FILE: kernel/time/tick-broadcast.c:379:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'tick_broadcast_set_event', this function's name, in a string
#95: FILE: kernel/time/tick-broadcast.c:388:
+				       "tick_broadcast_set_event is "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#96: FILE: kernel/time/tick-broadcast.c:389:
+				       "tick_broadcast_set_event is "
+				       "stuck %llx %llx\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
