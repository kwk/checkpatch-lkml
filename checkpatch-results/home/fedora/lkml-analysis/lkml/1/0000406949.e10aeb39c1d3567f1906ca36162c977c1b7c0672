Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#90: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:471:
+			unsigned int temp = kstat_cpu(i).irqs[j];
+			sum += temp;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
