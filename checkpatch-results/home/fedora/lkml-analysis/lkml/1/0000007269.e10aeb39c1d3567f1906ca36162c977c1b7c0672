CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/highmem.h:58:
+extern void *kmap_pfn_prot(unsigned long pfn, pgprot_t prot);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#79: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/highmem.h:91:
+# define kmap_atomic_prot(page, type, prot)	({ pagefault_disable(); kmap_pfn_prot(page_to_pfn(page), prot); })

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
