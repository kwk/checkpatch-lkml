#28: 
The current hierarchical RQ group scheduler suffers from a number of problems:

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#162: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:417:
+		delta = calc_delta_mine(delta,
+				cfs_rq_of(se)->load.weight, &se->load);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#189: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:439:
+		.inv_weight = 1UL << (WMULT_SHIFT-NICE_0_SHIFT)
 		                                 ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#199: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:449:
+		delta = calc_delta_mine(delta,
+				cfs_rq_of(se)->load.weight, se_lw);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#326: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:821:
+	if (rq_of(cfs_rq)->load.weight != curr->load.weight ||
+			!sched_feat(WAKEUP_PREEMPT))

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#394: FILE: kernel/sched_fair.c:1167:
+	next = se = __pick_next_entity(cfs_rq);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
