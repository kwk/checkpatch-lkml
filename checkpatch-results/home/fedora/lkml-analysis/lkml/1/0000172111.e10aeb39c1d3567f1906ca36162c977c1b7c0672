CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#168: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:185:
+		p = sd->alloc_skb_page[i] = alloc_pages(gfp_mask, 0);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
