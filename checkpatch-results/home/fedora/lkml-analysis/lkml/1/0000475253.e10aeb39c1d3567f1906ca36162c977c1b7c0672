WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#144: FILE: include/linux/acpi_pmtmr.h:1:
+#ifndef _ACPI_PMTMR_H_

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#156: FILE: include/linux/acpi_pmtmr.h:13:
+#define ACPI_PM_OVRRUN	(1<<24)
                       	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#156: FILE: include/linux/acpi_pmtmr.h:13:
+#define ACPI_PM_OVRRUN	(1<<24)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#160: FILE: include/linux/acpi_pmtmr.h:17:
+extern u32 acpi_pm_read_verified(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
