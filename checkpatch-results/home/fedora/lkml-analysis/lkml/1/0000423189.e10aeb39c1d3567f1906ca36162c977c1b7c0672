WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#46: 
#!/bin/nash

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#93: FILE: init:31:
+umount /initrd/dev

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
