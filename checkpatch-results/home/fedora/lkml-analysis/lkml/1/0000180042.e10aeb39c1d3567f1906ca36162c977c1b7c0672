#38: 
2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

WARNING:UNKNOWN_COMMIT_ID: Unknown commit id 'f3f80a9205da74fa56d613f4c14b88b6e4e6caa8', maybe rebased or not pulled?
#44: 
commit f3f80a9205da74fa56d613f4c14b88b6e4e6caa8 upstream.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#75: FILE: sound/usb/caiaq/caiaq-midi.c:63:
+	struct snd_usb_caiaqdev *dev = substream->rmidi->private_data;
+	if (dev->midi_out_active) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'snd_usb_caiaq_midi_send', this function's name, in a string
#98: FILE: sound/usb/caiaq/caiaq-midi.c:88:
+		log("snd_usb_caiaq_midi_send(%p): usb_submit_urb() failed,"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#99: FILE: sound/usb/caiaq/caiaq-midi.c:89:
+		log("snd_usb_caiaq_midi_send(%p): usb_submit_urb() failed,"
+		    "ret=%d, len=%d\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
