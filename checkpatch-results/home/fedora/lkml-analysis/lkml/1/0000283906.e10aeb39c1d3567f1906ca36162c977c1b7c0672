WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#112: FILE: include/linux/hardirq.h:90:
+#define in_atomic()	((preempt_count() & ~PREEMPT_ACTIVE) != PREEMPT_INATOMIC_BASE)

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#269: FILE: lib/kernel_lock.c:57:
+ * These are the BKL spinlocks - we try to be polite about preemption. $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#300: FILE: lib/kernel_lock.c:82:
+			while (spin_is_locked(&kernel_flag))

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/locking/lockdep-design.html#annotations

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#340: FILE: lib/kernel_lock.c:118:
+	int depth = current->lock_depth+1;
 	                               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#341: FILE: lib/kernel_lock.c:119:
+	int depth = current->lock_depth+1;
+	if (likely(!depth))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#350: FILE: lib/kernel_lock.c:126:
+	BUG_ON(current->lock_depth < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
