CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#60: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_host.h:771:
+#define HF_NMI_MASK		(1 << 3)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
