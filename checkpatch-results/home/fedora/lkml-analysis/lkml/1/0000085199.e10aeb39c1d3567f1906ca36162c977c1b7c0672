#64: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/pci-dma.c:23:
+extern int swiotlb_late_init_with_default_size (size_t size);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#73: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/pci-dma.c:49:
+extern struct dma_map_ops swiotlb_dma_ops;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dma_map_ops should normally be const
#73: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/pci-dma.c:49:
+extern struct dma_map_ops swiotlb_dma_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
