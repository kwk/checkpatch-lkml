WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#90: FILE: kernel/irq/chip.c:66:
+	printk("XXX dynamic_irq_cleanup() called on %u\n", irq);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dynamic_irq_cleanup', this function's name, in a string
#90: FILE: kernel/irq/chip.c:66:
+	printk("XXX dynamic_irq_cleanup() called on %u\n", irq);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
