CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#164: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs4_fs.h:223:
+extern int nfs4_init_session(struct nfs_server *server);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "state"
#208: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c:4097:
+		if (state != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
