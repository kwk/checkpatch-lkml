CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#121: FILE: checkpoint/ckpt.h:51:
+extern int cr_write_fname(struct cr_ctx *ctx, struct path *path, struct path *root);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
