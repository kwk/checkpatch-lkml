WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#74: FILE: drivers/staging/wlan-ng/p80211netdev.c:831:
+		/* block ioctls until fully initialised. Don't forget to call
+		   allow_ioctls at some point!*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#87: FILE: drivers/staging/wlan-ng/p80211netdev.c:1221:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
