WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#203: FILE: kernel/resource.c:386:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
