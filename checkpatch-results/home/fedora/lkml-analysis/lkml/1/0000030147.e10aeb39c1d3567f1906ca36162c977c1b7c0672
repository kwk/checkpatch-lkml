#106: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.c:543:
+		pr_err("acpi_evalf() called with empty format\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

#371: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.c:2770:
+		pr_notice("hotkey_source_mask: some important events were disabled: 0x%04x\n", r_ev);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
