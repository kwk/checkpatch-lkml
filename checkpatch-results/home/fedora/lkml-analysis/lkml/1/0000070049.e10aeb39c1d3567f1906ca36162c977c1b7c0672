CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*ld)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct tty_ldisc)...)
#111: FILE: drivers/char/tty_ldisc.c:210:
+	ld = kmalloc(sizeof(struct tty_ldisc), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ld"
#112: FILE: drivers/char/tty_ldisc.c:211:
+	if (ld == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
