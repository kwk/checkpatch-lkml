Subject: [PATCH 2/7] KVM: SVM: Move msrpm offset calculation to seperate function
                                                                ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#113: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:452:
+	BUG_ON(offset == MSR_INVALID);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
