WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .44
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#71: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/align.c:660:
+	lptr = (unsigned long *) ptr;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#74: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/align.c:663:
+		sw = elsize-1;
 		           ^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '^' (ctx:VxV)
#79: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/align.c:668:
+				ret |= __put_user(ptr[i^sw], addr + i);
 				                       ^

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '^' (ctx:VxV)
#81: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/align.c:670:
+				ret |= __get_user(ptr[i^sw], addr + i);
 				                       ^

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#91: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/align.c:676:
+	if (!ret) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#99: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/align.c:684:
+		else if (!(flags & ST) && (8 == length))

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#101: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/align.c:686:
+	} else

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'FPR' may be misspelled - perhaps 'FOR'?
#114: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/align.c:789:
+		/* Additional register addressing bit (64 VSX vs 32 FPR/GPR) */
 		                                                    ^^^

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#127: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/align.c:798:
+		/* Vector stores in little-endian mode swap individual
+		   elements, so process them separately */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#127: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/align.c:798:
+		   elements, so process them separately */
