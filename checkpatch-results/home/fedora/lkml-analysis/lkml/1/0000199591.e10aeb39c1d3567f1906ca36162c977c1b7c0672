Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

#98: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_sysfs.c:45:
+	ssize_t (*show)(void *, struct pfm_attribute *attr, char *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

+#define to_attr(n) container_of(n, struct pfm_attribute, attr);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#101: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_sysfs.c:48:
+#define to_attr(n) container_of(n, struct pfm_attribute, attr);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#129: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_sysfs.c:76:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#139: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_sysfs.c:86:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
