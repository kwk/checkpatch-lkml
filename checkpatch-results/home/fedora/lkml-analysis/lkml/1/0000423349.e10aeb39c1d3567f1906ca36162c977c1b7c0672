CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/acpi.h> instead of <asm/acpi.h>
#123: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:48:
+#include <asm/acpi.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after ioapic_blacklist_dmi_table[]
#141: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:113:
+static struct dmi_system_id __initdata ioapic_blacklist_dmi_table[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#153: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:125:
+void __init check_ioapic_blacklist(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
