WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#84: FILE: include/trace/fs.h:1:
+#ifndef _TRACE_FS_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

+	  This tracer records fsync() and fdatasync() calls. These calls

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo __read_mostly	bar" should be "foo __read_mostly bar"
#164: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_fsync.c:20:
+static int __read_mostly	tracer_enabled;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
