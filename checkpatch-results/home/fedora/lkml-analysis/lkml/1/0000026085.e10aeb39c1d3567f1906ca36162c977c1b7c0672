Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+            else if (i == rcCell->currentRateIndex)
             {
                 return 1;
             }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
