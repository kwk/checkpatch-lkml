The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:335:
+extern void set_swap_free_notify(int, swap_free_notify_fn *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#71: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:335:
+extern void set_swap_free_notify(int, swap_free_notify_fn *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'swap_free_notify_fn *' should also have an identifier name
#71: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:335:
+extern void set_swap_free_notify(int, swap_free_notify_fn *);

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
#97: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:553:
+	return;
