CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!i"
#90: FILE: fs/squashfs/export.c:91:
+	if (i == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dentry"
#96: FILE: fs/squashfs/export.c:97:
+	if (dentry == NULL) {

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#97: FILE: fs/squashfs/export.c:98:
+		iput(i);
 		^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#128: FILE: fs/Kconfig:1351:
+source "fs/squashfs/Kconfig"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#153: FILE: init/do_mounts_rd.c:68:
+	squashfsb = (struct squashfs_super_block *) buf;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
