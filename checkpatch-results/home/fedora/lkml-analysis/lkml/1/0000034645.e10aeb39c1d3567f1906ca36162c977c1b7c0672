Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#61: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:427:
+				pr_err("Error, output file %s exists, use -A "
+				       "to append or -f to overwrite.\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#67: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-record.c:433:
+			char oldname[PATH_MAX];
+			snprintf(oldname, sizeof(oldname), "%s.old",

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
