WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#57: FILE: arch/arm/mach-orion5x/Kconfig:60:
+config MACH_LINKSTATION_LS_HGL
+	bool "Buffalo Linkstation LS-HGL"
+	select I2C_BOARDINFO
+	help
+	  Say 'Y' here if you want your kernel to support the

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#80: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#85: FILE: arch/arm/mach-orion5x/ls_hgl-setup.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#86: FILE: arch/arm/mach-orion5x/ls_hgl-setup.c:2:
+ * arch/arm/mach-orion5x/ls_hgl-setup.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after ls_hgl_i2c_rtc
#160: FILE: arch/arm/mach-orion5x/ls_hgl-setup.c:76:
+static struct i2c_board_info __initdata ls_hgl_i2c_rtc = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
