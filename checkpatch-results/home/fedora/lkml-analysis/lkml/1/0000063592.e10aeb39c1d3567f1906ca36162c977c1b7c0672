ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#52: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-trace.c:23:
+static unsigned long	total_sample = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#159: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-trace.c:263:
+	if (!size || count_event(event) < 0) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
