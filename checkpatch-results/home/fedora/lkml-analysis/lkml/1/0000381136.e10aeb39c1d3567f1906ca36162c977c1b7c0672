 	  Paravirtualization is a way of running multiple instances of
 	  Linux on the same machine, under a hypervisor.  This option
 	  changes the kernel so it can modify itself when it is run
 	  under a hypervisor, improving performance significantly.
 	  However, when run without a hypervisor the kernel is
 	  theoretically slower.  If in doubt, say N.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
