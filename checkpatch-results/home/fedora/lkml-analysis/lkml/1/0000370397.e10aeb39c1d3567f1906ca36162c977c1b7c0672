WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 128 exceeds 100 columns
#37: FILE: drivers/net/tulip/de4x5.h:1020:
+#define MOTO_SROM_BUG    ((lp->active == 8) && (((le32_to_cpu(get_unaligned(((__le32 *)dev->dev_addr))))&0x00ffffff)==0x3e0008))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '&' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
