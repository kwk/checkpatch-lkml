Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#411: FILE: kernel/irq/numa_migrate.c:112:
 {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!desc->chip->copy_chip_data"
#417: FILE: kernel/irq/numa_migrate.c:118:
+	    (desc->chip->copy_chip_data == NULL ||

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!desc->chip->free_chip_data"
#418: FILE: kernel/irq/numa_migrate.c:119:
+	     desc->chip->free_chip_data == NULL))

 }
+int __weak arch_init_irq_desc(struct irq_desc *desc, int node)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
