This patch only fixes the sub_remove() and ridr_remove() portions of ridr.c,

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#109: FILE: lib/ridr.c:360:
+		to_free->bitmap = to_free->count = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const char *' should also have an identifier name
#129: FILE: include/linux/idr.h:120:
+void idr_remove_warning(const char *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
