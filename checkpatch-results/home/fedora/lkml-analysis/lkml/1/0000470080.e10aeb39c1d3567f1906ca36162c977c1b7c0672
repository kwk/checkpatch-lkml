ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#46: FILE: arch/um/kernel/irq.c:82:
+static struct irq_fd *active_fds = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*new_fd)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct irq_fd)...)
#56: FILE: arch/um/kernel/irq.c:128:
+	new_fd = kmalloc(sizeof(struct irq_fd), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
