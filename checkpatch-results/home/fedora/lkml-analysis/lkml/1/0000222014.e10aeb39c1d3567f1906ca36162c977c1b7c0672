CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#62: FILE: drivers/net/e1000e/e1000.h:308:
+#define FLAG_READ_ONLY_NVM                (1 << 8)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: drivers/net/e1000e/e1000.h:389:
+extern void e1000e_write_protect_nvm_ich8lan(struct e1000_hw *hw);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
