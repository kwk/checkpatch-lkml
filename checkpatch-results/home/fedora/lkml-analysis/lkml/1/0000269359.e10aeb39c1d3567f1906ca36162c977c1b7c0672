WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#67: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_attach.c:70:
+		PFM_DBG("load_pid=%d has a context "
+			"old=%p new=%p cur=%p",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#111: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_attach.c:114:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#113: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_attach.c:116:
+	if (ctx->task != current) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
