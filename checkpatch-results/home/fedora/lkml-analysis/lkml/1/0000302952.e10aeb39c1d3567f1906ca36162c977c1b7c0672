CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#129: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:523:
+	BUG_ON(!host->cmd);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#141: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:531:
+	if (host->data == NULL) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!host->data"
#141: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:531:
+	if (host->data == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#153: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:543:
+	} else

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "host->cmd"
#172: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:557:
+	if (host->cmd != NULL && !host->abort) {

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#206: FILE: drivers/mmc/host/omap.c:1336:
