Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#206: FILE: tools/perf/util/string.c:175:
+	char **p;
+	for (p = argv; *p; p++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#227: FILE: tools/perf/util/string.c:196:
+	char **argv = zalloc(sizeof(*argv) * (argc+1));
 	                                          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!argv"
#230: FILE: tools/perf/util/string.c:199:
+	if (argv == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
