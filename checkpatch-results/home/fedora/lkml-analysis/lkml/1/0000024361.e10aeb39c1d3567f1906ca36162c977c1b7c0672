ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#73: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-stat.c:83:
+static volatile int done = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#100: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-stat.c:267:
+		if ((pid = fork()) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#190: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-stat.c:323:
+		while(!done);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
