CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#54: FILE: drivers/scsi/libsrp.c:430:
+	sc->sdb.sgt.sgl = (void *) (unsigned long) addr;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#248: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1020:
+	ret = __sg_alloc_table(&sdb->sgt, req->nr_phys_segments, gfp_mask,
+								 scsi_sg_alloc);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#262: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1037:
+	BUG_ON(count > sdb->sgt.nents);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
