WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#155: FILE: arch/um/include/chan_kern.h:43:
+extern int enable_chan(struct line *line);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
