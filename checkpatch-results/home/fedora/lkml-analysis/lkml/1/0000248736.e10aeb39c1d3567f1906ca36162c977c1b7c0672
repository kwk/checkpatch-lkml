#40: 
This also fixes the following warning on x86 when CONFIG_X86_PAE is not set:

ERROR:WEAK_DECLARATION: Using weak declarations can have unintended link defects
#94: FILE: include/asm-generic/pgtable-nopmd.h:58:
+extern void __weak pmd_free(struct mm_struct *mm, pmd_t *pmd);

Using weak declarations like __attribute__((weak)) or __weak
can have unintended link defects.  Avoid using them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#94: FILE: include/asm-generic/pgtable-nopmd.h:58:
+extern void __weak pmd_free(struct mm_struct *mm, pmd_t *pmd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
