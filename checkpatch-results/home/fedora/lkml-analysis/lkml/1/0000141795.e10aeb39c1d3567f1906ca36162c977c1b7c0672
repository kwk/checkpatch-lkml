WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#95: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/smp_64.c:1406:
+		pr_debug("per cpu data for cpu%d %lu bytes on node%d at "
+			 "%016lx\n", cpu, size, node, __pa(ptr));

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#124: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/smp_64.c:1435:
+	BUG_ON((pfn<<PAGE_SHIFT)&(PCPU_CHUNK_SIZE - 1UL));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#124: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/smp_64.c:1435:
+	BUG_ON((pfn<<PAGE_SHIFT)&(PCPU_CHUNK_SIZE - 1UL));
 	           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '&' (ctx:VxV)
#124: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/smp_64.c:1435:
+	BUG_ON((pfn<<PAGE_SHIFT)&(PCPU_CHUNK_SIZE - 1UL));
 	                        ^

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#188: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/smp_64.c:1497:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#208: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/smp_64.c:1517:
+		unsigned long start = (unsigned long) vm.addr;
