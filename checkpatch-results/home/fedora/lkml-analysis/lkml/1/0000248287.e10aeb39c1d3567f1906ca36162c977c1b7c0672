The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#81: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/ds2490.c:324:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "ds_reset_device: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

+			"Error allowing strong pullup\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
