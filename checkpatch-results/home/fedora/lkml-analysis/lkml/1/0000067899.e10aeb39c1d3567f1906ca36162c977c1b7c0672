#39: 
GCC < 4, on x86_64, does not accept symbol+offset operands for "i" constraints

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#137: FILE: Makefile:553:
+# arch Makefile detects if the compiler permits use of immediate values

useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
