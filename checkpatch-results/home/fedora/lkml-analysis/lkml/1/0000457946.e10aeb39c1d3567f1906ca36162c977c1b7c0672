Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#248: FILE: scripts/mod/sumversion.c:420:
+	fname = endname = sources;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#251: FILE: scripts/mod/sumversion.c:423:
+		char *endname = fname;
+		while (*endname && !isspace(*endname))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
