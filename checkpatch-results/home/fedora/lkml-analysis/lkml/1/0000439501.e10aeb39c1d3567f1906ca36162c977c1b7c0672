#30: 
Until 2.6.19, __vmalloc with GFP_ATOMIC was possible, but __get_vm_area_node

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#153: FILE: ./mm/vmalloc.c:171:
+	BUG_ON(in_irq());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
