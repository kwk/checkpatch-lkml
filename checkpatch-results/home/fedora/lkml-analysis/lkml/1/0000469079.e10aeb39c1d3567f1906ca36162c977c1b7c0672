spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#91: FILE: include/asm-i386/paravirt.h:155:
+	void (fastcall *startup_ipi_hook)(int phys_apicid, unsigned long start_eip, unsigned long start_esp);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
