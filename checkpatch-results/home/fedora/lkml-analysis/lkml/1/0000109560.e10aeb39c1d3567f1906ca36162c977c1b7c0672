WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'the'
#27: 
Add support for the the ds2782 standalone I2C gas-gauge.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#41: FILE: drivers/power/Kconfig:46:
+config BATTERY_DS2782
+	tristate "DS2782 standalone gas-gauge"
+	depends on I2C
+	help
+	  Say Y here to enable support for the DS2782 standalone battery

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#64: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#69: FILE: drivers/power/ds2782_battery.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#70: FILE: drivers/power/ds2782_battery.c:2:
+ * drivers/power/ds2782_battery.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'celcius' may be misspelled - perhaps ''?
#132: FILE: drivers/power/ds2782_battery.c:64:
+	/* Temperature is measured in units of 0.125 degrees celcius */
 	                                                     ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*info)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ds2782_info)...)
#271: FILE: drivers/power/ds2782_battery.c:203:
+	info = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ds2782_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Gauage' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Gauge'?
