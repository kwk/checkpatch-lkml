This makes 32 bit cpa similar to x86_64 and makes it easier for following PAT

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
