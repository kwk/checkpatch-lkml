#25: 
This patch converts the alpha architecture to use the generic read_persistent_clock and update_persistent_clock interfaces, reducing the amount of arch specific code we have to maintain, and allowing for further cleanups in the future.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#105: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/time.c:128:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "Using epoch = %d\n", epoch);

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#107: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/time.c:130:
+	if ((year += epoch) < 1970)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
