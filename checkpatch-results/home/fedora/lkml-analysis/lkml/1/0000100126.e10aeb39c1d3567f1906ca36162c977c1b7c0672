Subject: [PATCH 4/4] staging: android: binder: partial checkpatch cleanup

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'binder_alloc_buf', this function's name, in a string
#47: FILE: drivers/staging/android/binder.c:788:
+			     "binder: %d: binder_alloc_buf size %zd "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#48: FILE: drivers/staging/android/binder.c:789:
+			     "binder: %d: binder_alloc_buf size %zd "
+			     "async free %zd\n", proc->pid, size,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
