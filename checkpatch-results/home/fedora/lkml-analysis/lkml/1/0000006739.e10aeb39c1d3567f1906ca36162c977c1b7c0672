CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#79: FILE: drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:232:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:ENOTSUPP: ENOTSUPP is not a SUSV4 error code, prefer EOPNOTSUPP
#169: FILE: drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:1363:
+		status = -ENOTSUPP;

ENOTSUPP is not a standard error code and should be avoided in new patches.
EOPNOTSUPP should be used instead.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#266: FILE: include/asm-generic/gpio.h:126:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#280: FILE: include/linux/gpio.h:46:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
