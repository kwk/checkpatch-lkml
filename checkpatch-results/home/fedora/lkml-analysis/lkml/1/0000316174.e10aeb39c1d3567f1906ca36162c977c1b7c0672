CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#256: FILE: drivers/base/power/main.c:161:
+	struct device *dev = (struct device *) _dev;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#262: FILE: drivers/base/power/main.c:167:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#330: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:14:
+extern bool in_suspend_context(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
