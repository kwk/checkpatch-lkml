#27: 
It appears I inadvertly introduced rq->lock recursion to the hrtimer_start()

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#62: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:658:
+		if (wakeup) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#204: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:277:
+extern void wakeup_softirqd(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
