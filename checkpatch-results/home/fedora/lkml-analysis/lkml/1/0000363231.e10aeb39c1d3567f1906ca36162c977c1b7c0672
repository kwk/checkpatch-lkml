     ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#108: FILE: fs/locks.c:689:
+ * Deadlock detection: $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!current->files"
#151: FILE: fs/locks.c:731:
+	if (current->files == NULL || atomic_read(&current->files->count) > 1)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#162: FILE: fs/locks.c:742:
+static struct file_lock * what_owner_is_waiting_for(struct file_lock *block_fl)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
