WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#91: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c:145:
+			fh->fh_fsid[0] = new_encode_dev(MKDEV(ntohl(fh->fh_fsid[0]), ntohl(fh->fh_fsid[1])));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#131: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c:185:
+	if (fh->fh_version != 1) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
