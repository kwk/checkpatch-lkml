Subject: [PATCH 5/5] staging: et131x: et1310_rx: Fix coding style issues from checkpatch.pl

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#68: FILE: drivers/staging/et131x/et1310_rx.c:1079:
+	u32 v = *fbr;
+	v++;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

+	v &= (ET_DMA10_MASK|ET_DMA10_WRAP);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
