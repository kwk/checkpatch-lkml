WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#60: FILE: fs/unionfs/rename.c:37:
+	BUG_ON(!S_ISDIR(lower_parent->d_inode->i_mode));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#70: FILE: fs/unionfs/rename.c:47:
+	iput(unionfs_lower_inode_idx(dentry->d_inode, bindex));
