The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph

FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
