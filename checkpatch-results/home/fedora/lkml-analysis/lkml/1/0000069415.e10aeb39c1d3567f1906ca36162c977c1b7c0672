The following changes since commit 79b520e87e1214cfa107bdc8528b5d6c055a8b82:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/pgtable_types.h:280:
+extern void set_nx(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#171: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#176: FILE: arch/x86/mm/setup_nx.c:1:
+#include <linux/spinlock.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#180: FILE: arch/x86/mm/setup_nx.c:5:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#208: FILE: arch/x86/mm/setup_nx.c:33:
+}
+early_param("noexec", noexec_setup);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
