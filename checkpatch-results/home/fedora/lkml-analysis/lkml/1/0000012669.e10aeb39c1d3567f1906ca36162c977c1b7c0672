the only architecutre that implements the PCI DMA API in the own

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dma_map_ops should normally be const
#70: FILE: arch/alpha/include/asm/dma-mapping.h:6:
+extern struct dma_map_ops *dma_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pci_dac_dma_supported', this function's name, in a string
#474: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/pci_iommu.c:238:
+	DBGA("pci_dac_dma_supported %s from %p\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#498: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/pci_iommu.c:331:
+	/* Assume that non-PCI devices asking for DMA are either ISA or EISA,
+	   BUG() otherwise. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#499: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/pci_iommu.c:332:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
