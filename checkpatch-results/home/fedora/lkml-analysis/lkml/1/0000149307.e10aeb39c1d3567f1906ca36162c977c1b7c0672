ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#53: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_dma.c:359:
+static int i915_emit_cmds(struct drm_device * dev, int *buffer, int dwords)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
