WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct xpc_partition *' should also have an identifier name
#49: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc.h:635:
+extern enum xp_retval (*xpc_get_remote_heartbeat) (struct xpc_partition *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#81: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc_main.c:284:
+	for (partid = 0; partid < xp_max_npartitions; partid++) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
