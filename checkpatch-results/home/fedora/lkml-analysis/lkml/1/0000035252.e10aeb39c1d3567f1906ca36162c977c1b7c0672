Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#141: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-kmem.c:397:
+				sym = map_groups__find_function(&session->kmaps, session, addr, NULL);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!session"
#168: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-kmem.c:514:
+	if (session == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#580: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:480:
+				curr_map = map_groups__find_by_name(&session->kmaps, map->type, module);

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#817: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.c:1772:
+		pr_debug("Failed to load list of modules for session %s, "
+			 "continuing...\n", self->filename);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
