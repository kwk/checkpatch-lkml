WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#80: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/una_asm.S:1:
+/* una_asm.S: Kernel unaligned trap assembler helpers.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#375: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/unaligned.c:179:
+extern int do_int_load(unsigned long *dest_reg, int size,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#386: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/unaligned.c:190:
+	if (reg_num)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
