CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#55: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/siimage.c:335:
+	void __iomem *sata_error_addr
+		= (void __iomem *)hwif->sata_scr[SATA_ERROR_OFFSET];

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#80: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/siimage.c:425:
+	ide_hwif_t *hwif = drive->hwif;
+	void __iomem *sata_status_addr

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
