Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*slots)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_memslots)...)
#79: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:2454:
+		slots = kzalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_memslots), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
