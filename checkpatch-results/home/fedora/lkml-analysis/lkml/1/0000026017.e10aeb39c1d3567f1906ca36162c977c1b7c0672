ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#72: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:97:
+struct sym_entry		*sym_filter_entry_sched		=   NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '?:' (ctx:VxW)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!symbol_conf.vmlinux_name"
#154: FILE: tools/perf/builtin-top.c:1293:
+	symbol_conf.try_vmlinux_path = (symbol_conf.vmlinux_name == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
