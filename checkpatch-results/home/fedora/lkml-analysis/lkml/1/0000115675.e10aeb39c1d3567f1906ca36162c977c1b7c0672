WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#135: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_iucv.c:596:
+			if (priv->is_console) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#243: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_iucv.c:932:
+static struct dev_pm_ops hvc_iucv_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
