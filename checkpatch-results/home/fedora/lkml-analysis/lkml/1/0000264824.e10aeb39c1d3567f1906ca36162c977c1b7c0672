+		lower_start = lower_end = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#136: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/e820.c:640:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#251: FILE: include/asm-x86/e820.h:87:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
