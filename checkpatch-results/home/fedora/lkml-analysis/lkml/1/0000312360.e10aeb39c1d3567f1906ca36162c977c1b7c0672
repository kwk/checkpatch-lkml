WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#82: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse_64.c:35:
+unsigned int __cpuinitdata maxcpus = NR_CPUS;

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#91: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse_64.c:120:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "WARNING: maxcpus limit of %i reached."

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#92: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/mpparse_64.c:121:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "WARNING: maxcpus limit of %i reached."
+			" Processor ignored.\n", maxcpus);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#113: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:277:
+	extern unsigned int maxcpus;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#115: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:279:
+	maxcpus = simple_strtoul(arg, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+early_param("maxcpus", parse_maxcpus);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
