Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'poitner' may be misspelled - perhaps 'pointer'?
#587: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:2510:
+	 * update DMA poitner and transfer of 4n+2 bytes make those
 	              ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#608: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c:2902:
+			int len = COMMAND_SIZE(scsi_op);
+			if (unlikely(len > scmd->cmd_len || len > dev->cdb_len))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#883: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_sil24.c:1302:
+	extern int __MARKER__sil24_cmd_block_is_sized_wrongly;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
