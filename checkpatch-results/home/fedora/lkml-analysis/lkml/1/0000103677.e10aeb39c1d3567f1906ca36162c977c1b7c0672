WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#113: FILE: lib/kobject.c:220:
+	BUG_ON(kobj->name);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#311: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:1578:
+	if ((err = kobject_set_name(&rdev->kobj, "dev-%s", b)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
