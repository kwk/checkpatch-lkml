ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#83: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1288:
+	switch (timeout)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#104: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1309:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "schedule_timeout: wrong timeout "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'schedule_timeout', this function's name, in a string
#104: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1309:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "schedule_timeout: wrong timeout "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#105: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1310:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "schedule_timeout: wrong timeout "
+				"value %lx\n", timeout);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#113: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:1318:
+	 *        and ktime_to_jiffies */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
