WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'md_autodetect_dev', this function's name, in a string
#132: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:5774:
+		printk(KERN_CRIT "md: md_autodetect_dev: kzAlloc node failed"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
