CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#59: FILE: include/linux/kvm_xinterface.h:22:
+#define KVM_XIOEVENT_FLAG_PIO       (1 << kvm_xioevent_flag_nr_pio)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#107: FILE: include/linux/kvm_xinterface.h:153:
+	struct kvm_xinterface *intf = ioevent->intf;
+	rmb();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
