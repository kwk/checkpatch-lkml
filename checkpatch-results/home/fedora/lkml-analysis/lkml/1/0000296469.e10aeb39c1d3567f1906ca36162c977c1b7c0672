This reverts commit 5a982cbc7b3fe6cf72266f319286f29963c71b9e.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#90: FILE: mm/bootmem.c:163:
+	BUG_ON(!size);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
