WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'call_rcu_sched', prefer 'call_rcu' instead
#102: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:492:
+	call_rcu_sched(&p->rtort_rcu, rcu_torture_cb);

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cur_ops->cb_barrier"
#143: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:874:
+	if (cur_ops->cb_barrier != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
