+extern int os_arch_prctl(int pid, int code, unsigned long *addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

#212: FILE: arch/um/sys-x86_64/syscalls.c:144:
+	if((to->thread.arch.fs == 0) || (to->mm == NULL))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

#212: FILE: arch/um/sys-x86_64/syscalls.c:144:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
