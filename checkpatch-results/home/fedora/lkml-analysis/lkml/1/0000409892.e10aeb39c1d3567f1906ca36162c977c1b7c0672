Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#356: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_nv.c:1748:
+	dq->head = dq->tail = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#381: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_nv.c:1773:

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
