Subject: [PATCH] PM: add config option that allows disabling of VT switch during suspend

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#68: FILE: drivers/char/Kconfig:65:
+config DISABLE_SUSPEND_VT_SWITCH
+	bool "Disable the console switch prior to suspend (EXPERIMENTAL)"
+	depends on VT_CONSOLE && PM && EXPERIMENTAL && FBDEV_SUPPORTS_NOSWITCH
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  This option disables the automatic switch to VT console that happens
+	  prior to Linux going into a suspend/sleep.  Your
+	  video card/framebuffer must be able to properly restore the
+	  display (even if X is doing something crazy!) in this scenario.
+	  This is useful for saving precious milliseconds during suspend and
+	  resume; however, if your framebuffer lacks support, it could leave
+	  your display in a weird state.  If you're even seeing this option,
+	  it means at least one of your selected framebuffer drivers supports
+	  restoring the display.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
 config HW_CONSOLE
 	bool
 	depends on VT && !S390 && !UML

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 126 exceeds 100 columns
#109: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:14:
+#if defined(CONFIG_PM_SLEEP) && defined(CONFIG_VT) && defined(CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE) && !defined(CONFIG_DISABLE_SUSPEND_VT_SWITCH)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
