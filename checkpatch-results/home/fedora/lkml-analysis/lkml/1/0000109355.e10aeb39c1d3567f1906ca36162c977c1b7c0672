ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#64: FILE: drivers/connector/cn_proc.c:152:
+	msg = (struct cn_msg*)buffer;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
