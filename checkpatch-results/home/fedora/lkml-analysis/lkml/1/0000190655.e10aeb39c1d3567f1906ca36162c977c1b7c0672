WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#100: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#105: FILE: fs/quotaio_v1.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_QUOTAIO_V1_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#135: FILE: fs/quotaio_v1.h:31:
+#define v1_dqoff(UID)      ((loff_t)((UID) * sizeof (struct v1_disk_dqblk)))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#144: FILE: fs/quotaio_v2.h:1:

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#217: FILE: fs/quotaio_v2.h:74:
+#define V2_DQBLKSIZE	(1 << V2_DQBLKSIZE_BITS)	/* Size of block with quota structures */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 149 exceeds 100 columns
#220: FILE: fs/quotaio_v2.h:77:
+#define V2_DQSTRINBLK	((V2_DQBLKSIZE - sizeof(struct v2_disk_dqdbheader)) / sizeof(struct v2_disk_dqblk))	/* Number of entries in one blocks */

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
