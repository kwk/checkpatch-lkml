+config PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS
+	bool "Enable paravirtualized spinlocks"
+	depends on PARAVIRT && SMP
+	default XEN
+	---help---
+	  Paravirtualized spinlocks allow a pvops backend to replace the
+	  spinlock implementation with something virtualization-friendly
+	  (for example, block the virtual CPU rather than spinning).
+	  Unfortunately the downside is an as-yet unexplained performance
+	  when running native.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
