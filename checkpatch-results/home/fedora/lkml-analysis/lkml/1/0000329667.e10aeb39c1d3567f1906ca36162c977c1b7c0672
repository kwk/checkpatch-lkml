CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#301: FILE: lib/tracing/trace_wakeup.c:121:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#384: FILE: lib/tracing/trace_wakeup.c:204:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#662: FILE: lib/tracing/tracer.c:1245:
+	val = simple_strtoul(buf, NULL, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#669: FILE: lib/tracing/tracer.c:1252:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
