WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#35: FILE: sound/oss/pss.c:235:
+static void set_io_base(pss_confdata * devc, int dev, int base)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#52: FILE: sound/oss/pss.c:678:
+	else if(check_region(pss_cdrom_port, 2)) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#52: FILE: sound/oss/pss.c:678:
 	}
+	else if(check_region(pss_cdrom_port, 2)) {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#61: FILE: sound/oss/pss.c:681:
 	}
+	else {

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#61: FILE: sound/oss/pss.c:681:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
