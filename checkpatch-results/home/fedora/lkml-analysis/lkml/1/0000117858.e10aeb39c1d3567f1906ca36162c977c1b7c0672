ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#81: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c:387:
+void capi_ctr_down(struct capi_ctr * card)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#90: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c:416:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(capi_ctr_down);
