Subject: Re: [PATCH] Fix errors detected by checkpatch.pl on nmi_int.c

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:STATIC_CONST: Move const after static - use 'static const struct op_x86_model_spec'
#109: FILE: arch/x86/oprofile/nmi_int.c:25:
+static struct op_x86_model_spec const *model;

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
