#114: 
Commit b5b82df6, from May 2007, breaks no_console_suspend on the OLPC

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#139: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_core.c:2067:
struct uart_port *uport)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#157: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_core.c:2085:
+		if (termios.c_cflag == 0)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#159: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_core.c:2087:
+		else {

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#160: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_core.c:2088:
+			termios.c_ispeed = termios.c_ospeed =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#162: FILE: drivers/serial/serial_core.c:2090:
