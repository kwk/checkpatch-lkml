#36: 
This patch should allow UDMA > 2 modes on HP Pavilion N5430 and Fujitsu P2000.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#50: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/alim15x3.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/pci/alim15x3.c		Version 0.25	Jun 9 2007

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#107: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/alim15x3.c:628:
 static u8 __devinit ata66_ali15x3(ide_hwif_t *hwif)

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#149: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/alim15x3.c:648:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
