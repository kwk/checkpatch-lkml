WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#99: FILE: drivers/block/drbd/drbd_req.c:1023:
+	if (unlikely(bio_rw_flagged(bio, BIO_RW_BARRIER) && test_bit(NO_BARRIER_SUPP, &mdev->flags))) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
