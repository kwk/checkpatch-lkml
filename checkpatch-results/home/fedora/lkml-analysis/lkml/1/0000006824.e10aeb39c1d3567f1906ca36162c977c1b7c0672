WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct kset_uevent_ops should normally be const
#48: FILE: fs/dlm/lockspace.c:203:
+static struct kset_uevent_ops dlm_uevent_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
