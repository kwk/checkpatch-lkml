WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#91: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#96: FILE: arch/sh/kernel/reboot.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#97: FILE: arch/sh/kernel/reboot.c:2:
+ *  linux/arch/sh/kernel/reboot.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#116: FILE: arch/sh/kernel/reboot.c:21:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#123: FILE: arch/sh/kernel/reboot.c:28:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(pm_power_off);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#132: FILE: arch/sh/kernel/reboot.c:37:
+	if (mach_is_dreamcast()) {
+		writel(0x00007611, 0xA05F6890);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#149: FILE: arch/sh/kernel/reboot.c:54:
+static void native_machine_restart(char * __unused)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#211: FILE: include/asm-sh/emergency-restart.h:1:
+#ifndef _ASM_SH_EMERGENCY_RESTART_H

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#215: FILE: include/asm-sh/emergency-restart.h:4:
+extern void machine_emergency_restart(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
