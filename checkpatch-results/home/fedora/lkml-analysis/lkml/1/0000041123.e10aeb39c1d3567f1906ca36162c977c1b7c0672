Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#91: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:405:
+			pci_write_config_dword(bridge, PCI_PREF_BASE_UPPER32,
+						 0);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#93: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:407:
+			pci_write_config_dword(bridge, PCI_PREF_LIMIT_UPPER32,
+						 0);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#94: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:408:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
