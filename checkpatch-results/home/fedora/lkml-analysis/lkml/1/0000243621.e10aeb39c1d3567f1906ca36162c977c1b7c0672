#26: 
This patch adds support for DTR/DSR hardware flow control on 8250 driver on x86

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#72: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1751:
+ ^I^I^I^Ibreak;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
