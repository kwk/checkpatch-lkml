WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#84: FILE: drivers/base/platform.c:507:
+		pr_warning("oops-warning: probe function of platform driver %s"
+			       " lives in .init.text\n", drv->driver.name);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#94: FILE: drivers/base/platform.c:517:
+		pr_info("probably the probe function of platform driver %s can"
+				" be moved to .init.text\n", drv->driver.name);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#106: FILE: drivers/base/platform.c:560:
+	retval = code = __platform_driver_register(drv);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:206:
+extern int core_kernel_init_text(unsigned long addr)

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#121: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:209:
+extern int kernel_init_text_address(unsigned long addr);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "__module_init_text_address"
#212: FILE: kernel/module.c:2934:
+	ret = __module_init_text_address(addr) != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#237: FILE: kernel/module.c:2971:
+	struct module *mod = __module_address(addr);
+	if (mod) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
