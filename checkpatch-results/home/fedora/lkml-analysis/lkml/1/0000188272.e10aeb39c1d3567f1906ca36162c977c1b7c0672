CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#43: FILE: include/linux/audit.h:447:
+extern void audit_socketcall(int nargs, unsigned long *args);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
#52: FILE: include/linux/audit.h:528:
+#define audit_socketcall(n,a) ((void)0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#104: FILE: kernel/auditsc.c:1184:
+		int nargs = context->socketcall.nargs;
+		audit_log_format(ab, "nargs=%d", nargs);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
