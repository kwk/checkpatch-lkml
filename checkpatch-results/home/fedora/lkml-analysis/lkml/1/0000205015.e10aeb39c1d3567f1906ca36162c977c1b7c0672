WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'withing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'within'?

fanotify clients that fail to respond to access requests withing their

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'catagories' may be misspelled - perhaps 'categories'?
#34: 
This patch tracks the number of times we hit one of these catagories.  If
                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#72: FILE: fs/notify/access.c:46:
+	int evict = 0;
+	spin_lock(&group->misbehave_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#95: FILE: fs/notify/access.c:116:
+		if (!ret) {
+			userspace_error(group);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: fs/notify/fanotify.h:85:
+extern void fanotify_evict_group(struct fanotify_group *group);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#183: FILE: include/linux/fanotify.h:128:
+	unsigned int misbehave_count;	/* net misbehaviours.  increment on failure, dec on success */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
