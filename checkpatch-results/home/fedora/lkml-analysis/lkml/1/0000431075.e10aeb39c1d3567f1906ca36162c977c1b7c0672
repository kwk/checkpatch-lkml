WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const

+static struct vm_operations_struct afs_file_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#117: FILE: fs/afs/internal.h:713:
+extern int afs_page_mkwrite(struct vm_area_struct *, struct page *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct vm_area_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#117: FILE: fs/afs/internal.h:713:
+extern int afs_page_mkwrite(struct vm_area_struct *, struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
