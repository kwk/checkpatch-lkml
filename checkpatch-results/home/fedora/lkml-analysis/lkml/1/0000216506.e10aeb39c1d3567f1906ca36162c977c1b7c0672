WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#55: FILE: include/linux/relay.h:34:
+struct relay_page
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#99: FILE: kernel/relay.c:45:
+	while(n--)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*rpage)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct relay_page)...)
#177: FILE: kernel/relay.c:125:
+		rpage = kmalloc(sizeof(struct relay_page), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
