file to configure weight and ioprio_class for each device in a given cgroup.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!s[1]"
#299: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:1671:
+	if (s[1] == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#302: FILE: block/elevator-fq.c:1674:
+	ret = strict_strtoul(s[1], 10, &newpn->weight);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
