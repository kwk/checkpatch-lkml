WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#275: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc_partition.c:413:
+	discovered_nasids = kzalloc(sizeof(u64) * xpc_nasid_mask_words,
 				    GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!xpc_remote_copy_buffer_sn2"
#504: FILE: drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc_sn2.c:2424:
+	if (xpc_remote_copy_buffer_sn2 == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
