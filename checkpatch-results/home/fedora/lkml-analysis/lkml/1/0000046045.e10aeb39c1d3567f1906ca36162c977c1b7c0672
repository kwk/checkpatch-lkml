Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#150: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6574:
+static inline void do_sched_yield(void) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#150: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6574:
+static inline void do_sched_yield(void) 

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
