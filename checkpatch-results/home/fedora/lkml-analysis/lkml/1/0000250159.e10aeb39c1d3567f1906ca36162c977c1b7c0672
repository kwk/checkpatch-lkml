^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#168: FILE: net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_extend.c:72:
+	struct nf_ct_ext *ext = container_of(head, struct nf_ct_ext, rcu);
+	kfree(ext);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
