CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#173: FILE: tools/perf/util/probe-event.c:447:
+		if (include_group) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#269: FILE: tools/perf/util/probe-event.h:13:
+extern void del_trace_kprobe_events(struct strlist *dellist);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
