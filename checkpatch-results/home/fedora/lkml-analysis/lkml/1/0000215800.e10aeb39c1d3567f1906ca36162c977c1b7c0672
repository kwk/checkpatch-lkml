WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#213: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#218: FILE: fs/proc/stat.c:1:
+#include <linux/cpumask.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#248: FILE: fs/proc/stat.c:31:

 	                                          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#252: FILE: fs/proc/stat.c:35:
+	user = nice = system = idle = iowait =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#253: FILE: fs/proc/stat.c:36:
+		irq = softirq = steal = cputime64_zero;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#272: FILE: fs/proc/stat.c:55:
+			unsigned int temp = kstat_cpu(i).irqs[j];
+			sum += temp;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#280: FILE: fs/proc/stat.c:63:
+	seq_printf(p, "cpu  %llu %llu %llu %llu %llu %llu %llu %llu %llu\n",
+		(unsigned long long)cputime64_to_clock_t(user),

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#290: FILE: fs/proc/stat.c:73:
+	for_each_online_cpu(i) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
