CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#139: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:242:
+extern int run_helper(void (*pre_exec)(void *), void *pre_data, char **argv);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
