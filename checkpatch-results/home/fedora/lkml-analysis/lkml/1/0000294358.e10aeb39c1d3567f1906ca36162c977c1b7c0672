CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#89: FILE: fs/gfs2/glops.c:129:
+	if (gl->gl_object == GFS2_I(gl->gl_sbd->sd_rindex))
[...]
+	else if (gl->gl_ops == &gfs2_rgrp_glops && gl->gl_object) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
