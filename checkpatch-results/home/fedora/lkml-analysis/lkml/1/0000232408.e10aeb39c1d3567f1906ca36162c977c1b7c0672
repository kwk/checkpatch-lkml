I've been chasing Jeff about this for months so am now giving up and sending

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#104: FILE: drivers/ata/ahci.c:587:
+	/* The AHCI driver can only drive the SATA ports, the PATA driver
+	   can drive them all so if both drivers are selected make sure

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
