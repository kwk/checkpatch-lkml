WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#56: 
Now mainline doesn't have this line in iput (like sles9 has):
                                       ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#108: FILE: fs/jbd/transaction.c:230:
+		char * start = &_stack, * end, * stack;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
