The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#673: FILE: arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c:383:
+	if (in_atomic() || irqs_disabled() || debug_pagealloc)

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20080320201723.b87b3732.akpm@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#791: FILE: include/asm-x86/futex.h:105:
 {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#795: FILE: include/asm-x86/futex.h:109:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
