#80: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpu.h:1:
+#ifdef CONFIG_X86_32

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpu.h:43:
+extern void __cpuinit amd_enable_pci_ext_cfg(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
