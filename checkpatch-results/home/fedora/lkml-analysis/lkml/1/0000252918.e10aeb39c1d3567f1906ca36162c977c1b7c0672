#33: 
> I got this on latest -git with an intentionally corrupted filesystem image:

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#67: FILE: fs/jfs/namei.c:514:
+	if (ip->i_nlink == 0)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'jfs_unlink', this function's name, in a string
#68: FILE: fs/jfs/namei.c:515:
+		jfs_error(dip->i_sb, "jfs_unlink: i_nlink already zero");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
