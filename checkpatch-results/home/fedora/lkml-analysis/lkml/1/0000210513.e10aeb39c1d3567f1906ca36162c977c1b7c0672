WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#116: FILE: drivers/input/gameport/gameport.c:533:
+	dev_set_name(&gameport->dev, "gameport%lu", (unsigned long)atomic_inc_return(&gameport_no) - 1);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
