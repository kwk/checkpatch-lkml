WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#265: FILE: drivers/acpi/battery.c:191:
+	union acpi_object *element;
+	if (package->type != ACPI_TYPE_PACKAGE)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#400: FILE: drivers/acpi/battery.c:324:
+		if (!alarm) {
+			alarm = battery->design_capacity_warning;
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
