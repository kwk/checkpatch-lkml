#35: 
This patch tires to use CSS ID for records in swap_cgroup instead of pointer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/page_cgroup.h:94:
+extern unsigned short swap_cgroup_record(swp_entry_t ent, unsigned short id);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+extern unsigned short lookup_swap_cgroup(swp_entry_t ent);
