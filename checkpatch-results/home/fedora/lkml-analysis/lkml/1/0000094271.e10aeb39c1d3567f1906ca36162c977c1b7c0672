CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "consumer_dev_name"
#56: FILE: drivers/regulator/core.c:886:
+	if (consumer_dev_name != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*node)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct regulator_map)...)
#69: FILE: drivers/regulator/core.c:905:
+	node = kzalloc(sizeof(struct regulator_map), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!node->dev_name"
