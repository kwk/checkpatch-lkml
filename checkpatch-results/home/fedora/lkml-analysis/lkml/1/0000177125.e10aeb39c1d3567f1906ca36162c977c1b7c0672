ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while loop

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#50: FILE: kernel/lockdep.c:2085:
+#define MARK_HELD_CASE(__STATE)						\
+	case __STATE:							\
+		if (hlock->read)					\
+			usage_bit = LOCK_ENABLED_##__STATE##_READ;	\
+		else							\
+			usage_bit = LOCK_ENABLED_##__STATE;		\
+		break;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
