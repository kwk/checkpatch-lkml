Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#2139: FILE: include/linux/hardirq.h:82:
+#define in_atomic()		((preempt_count() & ~PREEMPT_ACTIVE) != 0)

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.

error condition as gracefully as possible.
