#43: 
>> Pierre, thoughts?  All my cards were borderline spec but Hein's got a mainstream, common card which seems to completely ignore the spec.  Can we just take the few-hundred-uS hit and allow initialization down at the bottom end, say 100kHz?

  ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
