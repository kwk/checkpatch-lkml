WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#41: FILE: arch/h8300/kernel/setup.c:60:
+extern void *initrd_start, *initrd_end;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#52: FILE: arch/h8300/kernel/setup.c:104:
+		initrd_end = (void *)(memory_start += be32_to_cpu(((unsigned long *) (memory_start))[2]));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
