CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'bio' may be better as '(bio)' to avoid precedence issues
#56: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:461:
+#define bio_integrity(bio) (bio->bi_integrity != NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "bio->bi_integrity"
#56: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:461:
+#define bio_integrity(bio) (bio->bi_integrity != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
