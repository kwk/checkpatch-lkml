#39: 
I have a plan to post a patch for removing reference count from page_cgroup.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#205: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:754:
+		ret = mem_cgroup_charge_common(newpage, NULL, GFP_KERNEL,
+			ctype, mem);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#265: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:797:
+		if (PageLRU(page)) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#272: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:804:
+		} else

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#291: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:56:
+extern int mem_cgroup_getref(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#348: FILE: mm/migrate.c:652:
+	BUG_ON(charge);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
