#28: 
We can use a fallback dev for cases of a NULL device being passed (mostly ISA)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#45: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma_32.c:18:
+/* Dummy device used for NULL arguments (normally ISA). Better would
+   be probably a smaller DMA mask, but this is bug-to-bug compatible

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
