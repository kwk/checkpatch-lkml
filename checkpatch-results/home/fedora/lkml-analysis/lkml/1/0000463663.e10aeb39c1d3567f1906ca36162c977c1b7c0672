ERROR:DATE_TIME: Use of the '__TIME__' macro makes the build non-deterministic
#53: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/ftdi-elan.c:2908:
+	       __TIME__, __DATE__);

It is generally desirable that building the same source code with
the same set of tools is reproducible, i.e. the output is always
exactly the same.

The kernel does *not* use the ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros,
and enables warnings if they are used as they can lead to
non-deterministic builds.
