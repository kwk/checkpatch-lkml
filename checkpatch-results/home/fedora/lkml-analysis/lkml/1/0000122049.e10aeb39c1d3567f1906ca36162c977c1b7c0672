#30: 
How about following changes because all TLB entries are flushed repeatedly if processes overflow at the table mapping the context. I think that the table should be initialized again because _tlbil_pid() flushes all TLB entries and tlbilx instruction isn't supported on E500(MPC8548).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#52: FILE: powerpc/mm/mmu_context_nohash.c:124:
+	for (n = first_context; n <= last_context; n++) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mm"
#54: FILE: powerpc/mm/mmu_context_nohash.c:126:
+		if (mm == NULL || mm->context.id == MMU_NO_CONTEXT)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
