CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#111: FILE: drivers/char/n_tty.c:316:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
