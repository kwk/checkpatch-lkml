#31: 
"size" field and everything after in banner isn't aligned properly on 64-bit archs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 144 exceeds 100 columns
#59: FILE: ipc/shm.c:113:
+		banner = "       key      shmid perms       size  cpid  lpid nattch   uid   gid  cuid  cgid      atime      dtime      ctime\n";

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
