#34: 
* Remove unused ->{writing,reserved} fields from struct ide_cd_config_flags.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#92: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:896:
+		if (info->cd_flags & IDE_CD_FLAG_LIMIT_NFRAMES)
[...]
 		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#265: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:2422:
+	cd->current_speed = (curspeed + (176/2)) / 176;
 	                                    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#266: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:2423:
+	cd->max_speed = (maxspeed + (176/2)) / 176;
 	                                ^

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!info->toc"
#284: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:2501:
+	if ((info->cd_flags & IDE_CD_FLAG_TOC_VALID) == 0 || info->toc == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
