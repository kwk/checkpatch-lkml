#109: FILE: kernel/pid.c:400:
+	list_for_each_entry (pc, &pid_caches, lh)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pid_cache)...)
#115: FILE: kernel/pid.c:406:
+	pc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pid_cache), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pc"
#116: FILE: kernel/pid.c:407:
+	if (pc == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#121: FILE: kernel/pid.c:412:
+	cachep = kmem_cache_create(pc->name,
+			sizeof(struct pid) + level * sizeof(struct pid_number),

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cachep"
#123: FILE: kernel/pid.c:414:
+	if (cachep == NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pc"
#132: FILE: kernel/pid.c:423:
+	if (pc != NULL)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!init_pid_ns.pid_cachep"
#148: FILE: kernel/pid.c:478:
+	if (init_pid_ns.pid_cachep == NULL)
