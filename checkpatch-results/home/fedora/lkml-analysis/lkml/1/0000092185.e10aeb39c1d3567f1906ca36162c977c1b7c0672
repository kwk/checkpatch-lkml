Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct regulator_ops should normally be const
#352: FILE: drivers/regulator/wm831x-ldo.c:286:
+static struct regulator_ops wm831x_gp_ldo_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

#378: FILE: drivers/regulator/wm831x-ldo.c:312:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ldo)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct wm831x_ldo)...)
#381: FILE: drivers/regulator/wm831x-ldo.c:315:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
