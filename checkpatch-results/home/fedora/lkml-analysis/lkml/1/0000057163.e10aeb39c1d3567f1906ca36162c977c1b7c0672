WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#116: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#121: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/ftrace.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/cacheflush.h> instead of <asm/cacheflush.h>
#135: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/ftrace.c:15:
+#include <asm/cacheflush.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0x00000000
#145: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/ftrace.c:25:
+static unsigned int ftrace_nop = 0x00000000;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'retured' may be misspelled - perhaps 'returned'?
