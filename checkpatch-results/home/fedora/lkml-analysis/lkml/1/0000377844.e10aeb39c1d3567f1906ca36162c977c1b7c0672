Moved the defintion of trap_init_f00f_bug to the sole user in init.c
          ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#55: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/intel.c:11:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
