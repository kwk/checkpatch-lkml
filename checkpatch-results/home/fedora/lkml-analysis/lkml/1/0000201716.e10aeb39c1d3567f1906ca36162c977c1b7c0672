Plese read the comment on top of fs/fuse/file.c::fuse_file_do_ioctl()
^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#60: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:1474:
+static int fuse_ioctl_copy_user(struct page **pages, struct iovec *iov,
+			unsigned int nr_segs, size_t bytes, bool to_user)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#75: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:1489:
+		kaddr = map = kmap(page);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#200: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:1614:
+	inarg.in_size = in_size = iov_length(in_iov, in_iovs);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#201: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:1615:
+	inarg.out_size = out_size = iov_length(out_iov, out_iovs);

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#366: FILE: include/linux/fuse.h:160:
+#define FUSE_IOCTL_COMPAT	(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#367: FILE: include/linux/fuse.h:161:
+#define FUSE_IOCTL_UNRESTRICTED	(1 << 1)

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#368: FILE: include/linux/fuse.h:162:
+#define FUSE_IOCTL_RETRY	(1 << 2)
