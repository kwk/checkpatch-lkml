* disable 66MHz clock in pdc202xx_tune_chipset() so it is correctly disabled

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
