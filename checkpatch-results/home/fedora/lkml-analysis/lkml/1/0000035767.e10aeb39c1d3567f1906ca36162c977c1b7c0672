WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#227: FILE: block/genhd.c:900:
+	res = strict_strtoul(buf, 10, &timeout);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'disk_range_show' to 'range_show'
#238: FILE: block/genhd.c:911:
+}

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'disk_idle_hysteresis_show' to 'idle_hysteresis_show' 'disk_idle_hysteresis_store' to 'idle_hysteresis_store'
