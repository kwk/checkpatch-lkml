CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#73: FILE: include/linux/kprobes.h:289:
+extern int proc_kprobes_optimization_handler(struct ctl_table *table,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead
#175: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:626:

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#184: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:635:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:DUPLICATED_SYSCTL_CONST: duplicated sysctl range checking value 'zero', consider using the shared one in include/linux/sysctl.h
#240: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:1563:
+		.extra1		= &zero,

Commit d91bff3011cf ("proc/sysctl: add shared variables for range
check") added some shared const variables to be used instead of a local
copy in each source file.

Consider replacing the sysctl range checking value with the shared
one in include/linux/sysctl.h.  The following conversion scheme may
be used::

  &zero     ->  SYSCTL_ZERO
  &one      ->  SYSCTL_ONE
  &int_max  ->  SYSCTL_INT_MAX
