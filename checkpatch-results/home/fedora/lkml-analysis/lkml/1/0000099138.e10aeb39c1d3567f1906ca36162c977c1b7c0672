CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#132: FILE: include/linux/kvm.h:317:
+#define KVM_IOEVENTFD_FLAG_DATAMATCH (1 << kvm_ioeventfd_flag_nr_datamatch)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#200: FILE: include/linux/kvm_host.h:552:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#293: FILE: virt/kvm/eventfd.c:384:
+	BUG_ON(!IS_ALIGNED((unsigned long)val, len));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
