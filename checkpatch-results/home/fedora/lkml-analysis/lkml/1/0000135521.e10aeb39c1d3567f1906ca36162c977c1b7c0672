#44: 
a NULL derefence of dev->primary->master.  Adding a NULL check is
       ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#71: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_dma.c:61:
+			struct drm_i915_master_private *master_priv = dev->primary->master->driver_priv;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#72: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_dma.c:62:
+			struct drm_i915_master_private *master_priv = dev->primary->master->driver_priv;
+			if (master_priv->sarea_priv)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
