WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#758: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#763: FILE: tools/perf/util/data_map.c:1:
+#include "data_map.h"

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#768: FILE: tools/perf/util/data_map.c:6:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'input_stat.st_uid != geteuid()'
#874: FILE: tools/perf/util/data_map.c:112:
+	if (!force && input_stat.st_uid && (input_stat.st_uid != geteuid())) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!getcwd"
#901: FILE: tools/perf/util/data_map.c:139:
+		if (getcwd(__cwd, sizeof(__cwd)) == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#947: FILE: tools/perf/util/data_map.c:185:
+	dump_printf("\n%p [%p]: event: %d\n",
+			(void *)(offset + head),

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#952: FILE: tools/perf/util/data_map.c:190:
+	if (!size || process_event(event, offset, head) < 0) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
