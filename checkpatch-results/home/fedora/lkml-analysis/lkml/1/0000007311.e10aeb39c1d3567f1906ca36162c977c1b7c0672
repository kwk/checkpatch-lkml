WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'formate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'format'?

                                                 ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'from'

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#927: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:215:
+extern void kgdb_arch_set_pc(struct pt_regs *regs, unsigned long pc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#929: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:217:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
