CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#73: FILE: net/ipv4/ipvs/ip_vs_sync.c:758:
+	if (ip_vs_sync_state & IP_VS_STATE_MASTER && !sync_master_pid)

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
