Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#68: 
4. Deleted comment above sys_fallocate definition, as suggested by Christoph.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#176: FILE: fs/open.c:406:
+		ret = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
