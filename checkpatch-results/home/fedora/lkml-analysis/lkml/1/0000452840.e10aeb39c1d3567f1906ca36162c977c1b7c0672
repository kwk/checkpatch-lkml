WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0666'.
#102: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:988:
+	{13, "hugetlb",S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO,	    &hugetlb_fops},

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'size_t' should also have an identifier name
#179: FILE: include/linux/hugetlb.h:166:
+struct file *hugetlb_file_setup(size_t, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#193: FILE: include/linux/hugetlb.h:191:
+#define hugetlb_file_setup(size, resv)	ERR_PTR(-ENOSYS)

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
