#41: 
more symetric I have factord sysctl_data out of do_sysctl_strategy
     ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#153: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:2554:
+int sysctl_data(struct ctl_table *table, int __user *name, int nlen,
+		  void __user *oldval, size_t __user *oldlenp,

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#156: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:2557:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
