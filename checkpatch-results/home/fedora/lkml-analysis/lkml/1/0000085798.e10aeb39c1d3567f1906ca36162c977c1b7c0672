CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#132: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.h:11:
+extern char *cplus_demangle(const char *, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#151: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.h:30:
+#define DMGL_PARAMS      (1 << 0)       /* Include function args */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#152: FILE: tools/perf/util/symbol.h:31:
+#define DMGL_ANSI        (1 << 1)       /* Include const, volatile, etc */
