The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#88: FILE: include/linux/tmem.h:28:
+extern void tmem_set_ops(struct tmem_ops *ops);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#96: FILE: include/linux/tmem.h:36:
+	int ret = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/
