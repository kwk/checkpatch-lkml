Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#190: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap1/time.c:145:
+static unsigned long omap_mpu_timer_last = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#617: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/timer32k.c:258:
+extern struct timer_update_handler timer_update;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
