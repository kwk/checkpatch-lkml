CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#105: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:1108:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#107: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:1110:

+				svm->vcpu.arch.exception.pending)

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#125: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:2248:

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#293: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:2395:
+		/* In case of software exception do not reinject an exception
+		   vector, but re-execute and instruction instead */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#296: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:2398:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#298: FILE: arch/x86/kvm/svm.c:2400:
+			u32 err = svm->vmcb->control.exit_int_info_err;
+			kvm_queue_exception_e(&svm->vcpu, vector, err);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
