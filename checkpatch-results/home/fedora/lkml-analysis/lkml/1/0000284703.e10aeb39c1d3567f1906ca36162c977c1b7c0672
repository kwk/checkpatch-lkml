WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#43: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#48: FILE: fs/ubifs/scan.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#63: FILE: fs/ubifs/scan.c:16:
+ * this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u8' over 'uint8_t'
#90: FILE: fs/ubifs/scan.c:43:
+	uint8_t *p = buf;

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#120: FILE: fs/ubifs/scan.c:73:
+	uint32_t magic;

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*sleb)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ubifs_scan_leb)...)
#191: FILE: fs/ubifs/scan.c:144:
+	sleb = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ubifs_scan_leb), GFP_NOFS);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#202: FILE: fs/ubifs/scan.c:155:
+		ubifs_err("cannot read %d bytes from LEB %d:%d,"
+			  " error %d", c->leb_size - offs, lnum, offs, err);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:SELF_ASSIGNMENT: Do not use self-assignments to avoid compiler warnings
#225: FILE: fs/ubifs/scan.c:178:
