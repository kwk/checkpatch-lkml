Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#191: FILE: arch/i386/lguest/lguest.c:454:
+extern struct Xgt_desc_struct early_gdt_descr;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
