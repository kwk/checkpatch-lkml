CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#51: FILE: arch/arm/mm/fault.c:31:
+#define FSR_LNX_PF		(1 << 31)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

#52: FILE: arch/arm/mm/fault.c:32:

#53: FILE: arch/arm/mm/fault.c:33:
+#define FSR_FS4			(1 << 10)

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#136: FILE: arch/arm/mm/fault.c:243:
+	fault = handle_mm_fault(mm, vma, addr & PAGE_MASK, (fsr & FSR_WRITE) ? FAULT_FLAG_WRITE : 0);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
