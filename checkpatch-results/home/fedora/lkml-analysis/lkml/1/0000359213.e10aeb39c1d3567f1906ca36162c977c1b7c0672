#34: 
IMHO linux should not drop unclassified vlan packets to pass these to sniffers. isn't it?

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#64: FILE: include/linux/if_vlan.h:181:
+	if (vlan_dev == NULL) {
[...]
+			 * due to congestion.
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vlan_dev"
#64: FILE: include/linux/if_vlan.h:181:
+	if (vlan_dev == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!skb->dev"
#65: FILE: include/linux/if_vlan.h:182:
+		if (skb->dev == NULL) {

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#79: FILE: include/linux/if_vlan.h:191:
+	} else

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#123: FILE: include/linux/if_vlan.h:216:
+			if (!compare_ether_addr(eth_hdr(skb)->h_dest,
+							skb->dev->dev_addr))
