CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ip->i_alloc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct gfs2_alloc)...)
#40: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:914:
+	ip->i_alloc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct gfs2_alloc), GFP_NOFS);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
