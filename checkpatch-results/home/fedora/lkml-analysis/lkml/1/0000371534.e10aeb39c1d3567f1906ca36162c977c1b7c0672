WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#100: FILE: oprofile/buffer_sync.c:534:
+				/* Ugly, let says task pointer can't be
+				   in the last page nor in the first page */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#108: FILE: oprofile/buffer_sync.c:542:
+					static int show_it = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#109: FILE: oprofile/buffer_sync.c:543:
+					static int show_it = 0;
+					if (show_it++ < 5) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
