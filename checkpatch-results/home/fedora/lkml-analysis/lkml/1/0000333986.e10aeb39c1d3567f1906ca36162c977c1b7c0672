#38: 
when mtrr is not covering all e820 table, need to trim the ram, need to update e820

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#113: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/setup_32.c:769:
+	if (mtrr_trim_uncached_memory(max_pfn)) {
+		max_low_pfn = setup_memory();
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#161: FILE: include/asm-x86/processor.h:134:
+extern void early_identify_cpu(struct cpuinfo_x86 *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct cpuinfo_x86 *' should also have an identifier name
#161: FILE: include/asm-x86/processor.h:134:
+extern void early_identify_cpu(struct cpuinfo_x86 *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
