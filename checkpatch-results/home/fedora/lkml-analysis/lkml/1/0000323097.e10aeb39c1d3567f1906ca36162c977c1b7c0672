WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kcalloc over kzalloc with multiply
#84: FILE: arch/x86/pci/mmconfig_64.c:130:
+	pci_mmcfg_virt = kzalloc(sizeof(*pci_mmcfg_virt) *
 				 pci_mmcfg_config_num, GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pci_mmcfg_virt"
#104: FILE: arch/x86/pci/mmconfig_64.c:156:
+	if (pci_mmcfg_virt == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#126: FILE: arch/x86/pci/pci.h:108:
+extern void __init pci_mmcfg_arch_free(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
