WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#178: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlmglue.c:673:
+	BUG_ON((!(lockres->l_flags & OCFS2_LOCK_BUSY)));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
