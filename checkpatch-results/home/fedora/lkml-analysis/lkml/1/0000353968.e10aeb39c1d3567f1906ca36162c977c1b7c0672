WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#37: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .9
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#171: FILE: arch/x86_64/lib/delay.c:39:
+	while ((now-bclock) < loops);
 	           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#171: FILE: arch/x86_64/lib/delay.c:39:
+	while ((now-bclock) < loops);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:WHILE_AFTER_BRACE: while should follow close brace '}'
#171: FILE: arch/x86_64/lib/delay.c:39:
 	}
+	while ((now-bclock) < loops);

while should follow the closing bracket on the same line::

  do {
          ...
  } while(something);

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Ajust' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Adjust'?
#209: FILE: drivers/acpi/video.c:1648:
+	/* Ajust level_current to closest available level */
 	   ^^^^^

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#374: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/eeprom.c:132:
+	/* Hide Vaio private settings to regular users:
+	   - BIOS passwords: bytes 0x00 to 0x0f

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#411: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/eeprom.c:218:
 			dev_info(&new_client->dev, "Vaio EEPROM detected, "
+				 "enabling privacy protection\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#527: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ipw2200.c:4365:
+			queue_delayed_work(priv->workqueue, &priv->scan_event,
+					 round_jiffies(msecs_to_jiffies(4000)));

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#584: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/ipw2200.c:10720:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
