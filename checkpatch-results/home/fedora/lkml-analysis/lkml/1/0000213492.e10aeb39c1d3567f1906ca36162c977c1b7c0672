The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <LastNameOffset>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <cifsFileInfo>

#330: FILE: fs/cifs/readdir.c:644:
+	if ((cifsFile == NULL) || (current_entry == NULL))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

#330: FILE: fs/cifs/readdir.c:644:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cifsFile"
#330: FILE: fs/cifs/readdir.c:644:
+	if ((cifsFile == NULL) || (current_entry == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!current_entry"
#330: FILE: fs/cifs/readdir.c:644:
+	if ((cifsFile == NULL) || (current_entry == NULL))
