WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#36: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#41: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/include/plat/gpt.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#42: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/include/plat/gpt.h:2:
+ * arch/arm/plat-spear/include/plat/gpt.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'withing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'within'?
#99: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/include/plat/gpt.h:59:
+ * this that the fclk is common for each channels withing a timer unit.
                                                   ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct spear_timer *' should also have an identifier name
#117: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/include/plat/gpt.h:77:
+int spear_timer_init(struct spear_timer *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#117: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/include/plat/gpt.h:77:
+int spear_timer_init(struct spear_timer *, int);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#135: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/include/plat/gpt.h:95:
+int spear_timer_set_load(struct spear_timer *timer, int autoreload,
+		u16 value);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#137: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/include/plat/gpt.h:97:
+int spear_timer_set_load_start(struct spear_timer *timer, int autoreload,

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct spear_timer *' should also have an identifier name
#146: FILE: arch/arm/plat-spear/include/plat/gpt.h:106:
