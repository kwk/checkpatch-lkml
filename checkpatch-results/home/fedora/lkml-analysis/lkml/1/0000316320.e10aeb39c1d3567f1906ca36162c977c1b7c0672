CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '>>' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#198: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/hd.c:567:
+		printk("%s: cannot handle device with more than 16 heads - giving up\n", req->rq_disk->disk_name);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
