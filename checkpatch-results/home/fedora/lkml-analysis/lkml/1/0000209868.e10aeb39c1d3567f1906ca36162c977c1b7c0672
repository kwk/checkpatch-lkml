CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#177: FILE: include/linux/ftrace.h:78:
+extern int ftrace_arch_read_dyn_info(char *buf, int size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
