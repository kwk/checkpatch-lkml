ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#103: FILE: drivers/char/cyclades.c:2591:
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG "cyc:cy_flush_buffer ttyC%d\n", info->line);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'cy_flush_buffer', this function's name, in a string
#103: FILE: drivers/char/cyclades.c:2591:
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG "cyc:cy_flush_buffer ttyC%d\n", info->line);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#113: FILE: drivers/char/cyclades.c:2601:
+	info->xmit_cnt = info->xmit_head = info->xmit_tail = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#117: FILE: drivers/char/cyclades.c:2605:
+	if (IS_CYC_Z(*card)) {	/* If it is a Z card, flush the on-board
+					   buffers as well */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
