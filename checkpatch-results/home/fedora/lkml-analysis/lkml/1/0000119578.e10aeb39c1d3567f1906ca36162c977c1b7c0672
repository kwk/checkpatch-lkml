#25: 
So far we've allocated space at ->writepage() time. This has the disadvantage

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#58: FILE: fs/ext2/file.c:48:
+static struct vm_operations_struct ext2_file_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
