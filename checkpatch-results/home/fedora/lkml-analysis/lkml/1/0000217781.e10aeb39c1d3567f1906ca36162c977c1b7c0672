Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#86: FILE: drivers/char/pty.c:43:
+	BUG_ON(!tty);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#87: FILE: drivers/char/pty.c:44:
+	if (tty->driver->subtype == PTY_TYPE_MASTER)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#124: FILE: drivers/char/pty.c:105:

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)

+	return (count < N_TTY_BUF_SIZE/2) ? 0 : count;
 	                              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
