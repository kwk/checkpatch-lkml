CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#240: FILE: drivers/mtd/maps/integrator-flash.c:196:
+	if (info->nr_subdev == 1)
[...]
+	else if (info->nr_subdev > 1) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!info->mtd"
#254: FILE: drivers/mtd/maps/integrator-flash.c:210:
+		if (info->mtd == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#257: FILE: drivers/mtd/maps/integrator-flash.c:213:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "armflash: multiple devices found but "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#258: FILE: drivers/mtd/maps/integrator-flash.c:214:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "armflash: multiple devices found but "
+		       "MTD concat support disabled.\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
