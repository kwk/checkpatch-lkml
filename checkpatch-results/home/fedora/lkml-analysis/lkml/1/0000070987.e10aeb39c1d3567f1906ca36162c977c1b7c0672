WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#49: FILE: fs/ext2/file.c:43:
+static struct vm_operations_struct ext2_file_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#110: FILE: fs/ext2/inode.c:833:
+				     (1 << BH_Dirty)|(1 << BH_Uptodate));
 				                    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#112: FILE: fs/ext2/inode.c:835:
+	head = bh = page_buffers(page);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
