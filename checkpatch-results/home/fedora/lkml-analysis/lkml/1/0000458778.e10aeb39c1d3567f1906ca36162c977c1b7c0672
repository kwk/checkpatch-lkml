WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'maxumum' may be misspelled - perhaps 'maximum'?
#58: 
after PM event.  This includes maxumum split transaction
                               ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pci_save_pcix_state', this function's name, in a string
#75: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:602:
+		dev_err(&dev->dev, "Out of memory in pci_save_pcix_state\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:OOM_MESSAGE: Possible unnecessary 'out of memory' message
#75: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:602:
 	if (!save_state) {
+		dev_err(&dev->dev, "Out of memory in pci_save_pcix_state\n");

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#81: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:607:
+	if (dev->hdr_type == PCI_HEADER_TYPE_BRIDGE) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
