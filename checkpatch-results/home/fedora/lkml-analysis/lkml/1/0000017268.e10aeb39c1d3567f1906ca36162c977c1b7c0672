Commit 62edab9056a6cf0c9207339c8892c923a5217e45 (from June 2009 but merged

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#54: FILE: arch/x86/mm/kmmio.c:541:
+	unsigned long* dr6_p = (unsigned long *)ERR_PTR(arg->err);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
