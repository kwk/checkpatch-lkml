There are two ways to use this driver extension with a kernel boot argument.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'the'
#47: 
1) Allow variable retries for the the hardware via dbgp_bulk_read().

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct kgdb_io should normally be const
#124: FILE: drivers/usb/early/ehci-dbgp.c:99:
+static struct kgdb_io kgdbdbgp_io_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#138: FILE: drivers/usb/early/ehci-dbgp.c:196:
+static int dbgp_wait_until_done(unsigned ctrl, int loop)

#190: FILE: drivers/usb/early/ehci-dbgp.c:572:
+	dbgp_endpoint_in = dbgp_desc.bDebugInEndpoint;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#261: FILE: drivers/usb/early/ehci-dbgp.c:1048:
+		kgdbdbgp_wait_time = simple_strtoul(ptr, &ptr, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
