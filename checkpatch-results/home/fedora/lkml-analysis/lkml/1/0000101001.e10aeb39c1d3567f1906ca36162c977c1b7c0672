WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#62: 
#include <stdio.h>

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'test'

$ gcc -O2 -o test test.c ; ./test
