+extern void fat_time_fat2unix(struct msdos_sb_info *sbi, struct timespec *ts,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#321: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:1118:
+		de[0].ctime_cs = de[1].ctime_cs = time_cs;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
