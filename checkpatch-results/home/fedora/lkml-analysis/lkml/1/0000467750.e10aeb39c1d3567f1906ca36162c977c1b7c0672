WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#40: FILE: include/linux/rtnetlink.h:1045:
+#define rtnl_lock() __rtnl_lock(__FILE__, __LINE__);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#41: FILE: include/linux/rtnetlink.h:1046:
+extern void __rtnl_lock(const char* fname, int fline);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#41: FILE: include/linux/rtnetlink.h:1046:
+extern void __rtnl_lock(const char* fname, int fline);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
