WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#132: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c:614:
+	unsigned after_mxcsr_mask;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#161: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c:2346:
+	BUG_ON((unsigned long)&vcpu->host_fx_image & 0xF);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
