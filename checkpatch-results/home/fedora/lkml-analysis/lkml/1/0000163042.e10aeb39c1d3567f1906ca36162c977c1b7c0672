CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ehotk->hotplug_slot)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct hotplug_slot)...)

+	ehotk->hotplug_slot = kzalloc(sizeof(struct hotplug_slot), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
