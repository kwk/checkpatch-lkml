WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!s->s_fs_info"

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'squashfs_fill_super', this function's name, in a string
#279: FILE: fs/squashfs/super.c:244:
+	TRACE("Leaving squashfs_fill_super\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'squashfs_statfs', this function's name, in a string

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#314: FILE: fs/squashfs/super.c:279:
+	buf->f_bfree = buf->f_bavail = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
