ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#113: FILE: drivers/char/generic_serial.c:52:
+int gs_put_char(struct tty_struct * tty, unsigned char ch)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#120: FILE: drivers/char/generic_serial.c:58:
+	if (!tty) return 0;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
