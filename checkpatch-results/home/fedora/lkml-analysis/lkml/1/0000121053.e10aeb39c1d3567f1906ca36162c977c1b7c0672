WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#60: FILE: block/blk-ipoll.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:JIFFIES_COMPARISON: Comparing jiffies is almost always wrong; prefer time_after, time_before and friends

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#169: FILE: block/blk-ipoll.c:110:
+	BUG_ON(!test_bit(IPOLL_F_SCHED, &ipoll->state));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#170: FILE: block/blk-ipoll.c:111:
+        smp_mb__before_clear_bit();$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __cpuinitdata should be placed after blk_ipoll_cpu_notifier
#204: FILE: block/blk-ipoll.c:145:
+static struct notifier_block __cpuinitdata blk_ipoll_cpu_notifier = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#356: FILE: include/linux/blk-ipoll.h:31:
+extern void blk_ipoll_sched(struct blk_ipoll *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#357: FILE: include/linux/blk-ipoll.h:32:

#357: FILE: include/linux/blk-ipoll.h:32:
+extern void blk_ipoll_init(struct blk_ipoll *, int, blk_ipoll_fn *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
