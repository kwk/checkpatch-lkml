CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#57: FILE: drivers/serial/sunzilog.c:1005:
+	struct uart_sunzilog_port *up = (struct uart_sunzilog_port *) port;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#59: FILE: drivers/serial/sunzilog.c:1007:
+	struct zilog_channel __iomem *channel
+		= ZILOG_CHANNEL_FROM_PORT(&up->port);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#61: FILE: drivers/serial/sunzilog.c:1009:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
