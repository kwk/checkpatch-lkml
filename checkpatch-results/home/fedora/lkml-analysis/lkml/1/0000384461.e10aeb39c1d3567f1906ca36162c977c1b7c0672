WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pwc_isoc_cleanup', this function's name, in a string
#98: FILE: drivers/media/video/pwc/pwc-if.c:946:
+	PWC_DEBUG_OPEN(">> pwc_isoc_cleanup()\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pdev"
#99: FILE: drivers/media/video/pwc/pwc-if.c:947:
+	if (pdev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited before semicolon
#154: FILE: drivers/media/video/pwc/pwc-if.c:1324:
+				rv = -pdev->error_status ;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#215: FILE: drivers/media/video/pwc/pwc-if.c:1404:
+^Istruct pwc_device *pdev; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
