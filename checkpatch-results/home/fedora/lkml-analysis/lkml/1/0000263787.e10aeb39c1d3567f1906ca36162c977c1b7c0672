WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#161: 
#define cpuid_to_nasid(cpuid)           (sn_nodepda->phys_cpuid[cpuid].nasid)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 142 exceeds 100 columns
#187: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/setup.c:630:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "nodepdaindr[%d]->phys_cpuid[%d] - nasid %d slice %d subnode %d\n", i, cpuid, nasid, slice, subnode);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
