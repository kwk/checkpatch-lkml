CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#92: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c:329:
+void scsi_wait_for_targets_gone(struct Scsi_Host *shost)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#116: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_host.h:750:
+extern void scsi_wait_for_targets_gone(struct Scsi_Host *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct Scsi_Host *' should also have an identifier name
#116: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_host.h:750:
+extern void scsi_wait_for_targets_gone(struct Scsi_Host *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
