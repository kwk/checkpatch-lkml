CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#182: FILE: drivers/net/bnx2.h:382:
+#define BNX2_PCICFG_MSI_CONTROL_ENABLE			 (1L<<16)
                                       			    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#182: FILE: drivers/net/bnx2.h:382:
+#define BNX2_PCICFG_MSI_CONTROL_ENABLE			 (1L<<16)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
