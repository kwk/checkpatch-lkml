Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*tlist)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct timer_list)...)
#234: FILE: kernel/time/timer_list.c:133:
+	tlist = kmalloc(sizeof(struct timer_list) * MAX_TIMERS_PER_SLOT,

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#289: FILE: include/linux/timer-internals.h:9:

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
