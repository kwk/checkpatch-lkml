CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "port->info"
#208: FILE: drivers/serial/sc26xx.c:135:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#222: FILE: drivers/serial/sc26xx.c:149:
+			if (status & SR_BREAK) {
[...]
+			} else if (status & SR_PARITY)
[...]
+			else if (status & SR_FRAME)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
