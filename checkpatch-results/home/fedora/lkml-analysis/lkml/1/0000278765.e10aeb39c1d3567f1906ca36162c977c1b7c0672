WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#56: FILE: drivers/char/epca.c:445:
+		BUG_ON(ch->port.count < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#201: FILE: drivers/char/epca.c:849:
+		if (!(ch->port.flags & ASYNC_CLOSING) &&
 			  (do_clocal || (ch->imodem & ch->dcd)))
