CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#45: FILE: include/linux/audit.h:454:
+extern void __audit_mq_notify(mqd_t mqdes, const struct sigevent *notification);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#54: FILE: include/linux/audit.h:491:
 }
+static inline void audit_mq_notify(mqd_t mqdes, const struct sigevent *notification)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "u_notification"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
