CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!gfs2_alloc_get"
#174: FILE: fs/gfs2/inode.c:714:
+	if (gfs2_alloc_get(dip) == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!al"
#245: FILE: fs/gfs2/ops_file.c:369:
+	if (al == NULL)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#362: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:822:
+	BUG_ON(ip->i_alloc != NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ip->i_alloc"
#362: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:822:
+	BUG_ON(ip->i_alloc != NULL);

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ip->i_alloc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct gfs2_alloc)...)
#363: FILE: fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:823:
+	ip->i_alloc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct gfs2_alloc), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
