Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#181: FILE: include/asm-x86/e820_64.h:31:
+extern int is_memory_all_reserved(unsigned long start, unsigned long end);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
