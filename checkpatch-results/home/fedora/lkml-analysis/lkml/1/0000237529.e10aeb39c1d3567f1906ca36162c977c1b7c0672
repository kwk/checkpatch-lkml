We still need the signal_struct->posix_timers which contains all useable
                                                                 ^^^^^^^

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#106: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:399:
+static struct pid *good_sigevent(sigevent_t * event)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
