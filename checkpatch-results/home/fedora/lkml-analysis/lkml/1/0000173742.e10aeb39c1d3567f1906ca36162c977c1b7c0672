WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dev_pm_ops should normally be const
#96: FILE: drivers/pci/pcie/portdrv_pci.c:52:
+static struct dev_pm_ops pcie_portdrv_pm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
