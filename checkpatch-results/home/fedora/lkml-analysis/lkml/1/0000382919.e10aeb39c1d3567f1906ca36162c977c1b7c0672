#35: 
Replace the shutting down of devices done by kernel_shutdown_prepare(), before

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#76: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:226:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
