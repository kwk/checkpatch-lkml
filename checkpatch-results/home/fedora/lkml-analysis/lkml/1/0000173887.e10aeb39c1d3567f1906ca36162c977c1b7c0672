ERROR:DATE_TIME: Use of the '__DATE__' macro makes the build non-deterministic
#222: FILE: drivers/edac/ppc4xx_edac.c:116:
+#define PPC4XX_EDAC_MODULE_REVISION	"v1.0.0 " __DATE__

It is generally desirable that building the same source code with
the same set of tools is reproducible, i.e. the output is always
exactly the same.

The kernel does *not* use the ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros,
and enables warnings if they are used as they can lead to
non-deterministic builds.

#303: FILE: drivers/edac/ppc4xx_edac.c:197:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
