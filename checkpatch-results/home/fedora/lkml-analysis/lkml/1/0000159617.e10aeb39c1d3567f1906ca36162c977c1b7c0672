Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around '&snp->smk_host.sin_addr'
#108: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:1519:
+		if ((&snp->smk_host.sin_addr)->s_addr  ==
+			(siap->s_addr & (&snp->smk_mask)->s_addr)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around '&snp->smk_mask'
#108: FILE: security/smack/smack_lsm.c:1519:
+		if ((&snp->smk_host.sin_addr)->s_addr  ==
+			(siap->s_addr & (&snp->smk_mask)->s_addr)) {

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#157: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:665:
+	for (maskn = 0; temp_mask; temp_mask <<= 1, maskn++);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!smack_netlbladdrs"
#175: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:709:
+	if (smack_netlbladdrs == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "m"
#186: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:720:
+	for (m = smack_netlbladdrs; m != NULL; m = m->smk_next) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!m->smk_next"
#187: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:721:
+		if (m->smk_next == NULL) {

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#199: FILE: security/smack/smackfs.c:733:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
