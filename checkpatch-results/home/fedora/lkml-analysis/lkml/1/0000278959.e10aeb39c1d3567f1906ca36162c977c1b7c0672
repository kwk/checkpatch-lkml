Subject: [PATCH] Alchemy: register mmc platform device for db1200/pb1200 boards

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#87: FILE: arch/mips/au1000/common/platform.c:235:
+extern struct au1xmmc_platform_data au1xmmc_platdata[2];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
