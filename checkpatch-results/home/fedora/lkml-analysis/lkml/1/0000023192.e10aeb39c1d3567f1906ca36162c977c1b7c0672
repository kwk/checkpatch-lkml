EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "system_wq"
#157: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:2304:
+	return system_wq != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#171: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:3102:
+	BUG_ON(!system_wq || !system_long_wq || !system_single_wq);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
