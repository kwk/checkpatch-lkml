CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#139: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43/dma.c:825:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#231: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c:1179:
+	 * calculation round soon. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:NETWORKING_BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: networking block comments don't use an empty /* line, use /* Comment...
#366: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2x00usb.c:366:
+	/*
+	 * Kill guardian urb (if required by driver).

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#438: FILE: net/mac80211/wme.c:676:
 				printk(KERN_DEBUG "allocated aggregation queue"
+					" %d tid %d addr %s pool=0x%lX\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
