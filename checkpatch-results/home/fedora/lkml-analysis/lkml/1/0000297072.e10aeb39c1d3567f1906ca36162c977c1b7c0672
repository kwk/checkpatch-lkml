I need to have many processes all reading from userspace the counter register

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hpets"
#71: FILE: drivers/char/hpet.c:228:
+	if (hpets == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#73: FILE: drivers/char/hpet.c:230:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
