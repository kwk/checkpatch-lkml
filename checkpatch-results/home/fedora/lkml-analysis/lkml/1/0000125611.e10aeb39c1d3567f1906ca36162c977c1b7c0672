Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Introduce "struct wait_info" to simplify wait_task*() pathes
                                                                           ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo*	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#54: FILE: kernel/exit.c:1092:
+	struct task_struct*	p;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
