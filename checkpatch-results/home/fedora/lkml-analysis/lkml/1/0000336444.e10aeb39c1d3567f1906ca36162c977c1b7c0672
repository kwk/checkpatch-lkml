WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#97: FILE: block/io-throttle.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#112: FILE: block/io-throttle.c:16:
+ * Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330,$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#159: FILE: block/io-throttle.c:63:
+	.ca_mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#226: FILE: block/io-throttle.c:130:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#228: FILE: block/io-throttle.c:132:
+	tmp = simple_strtoul(p, &p, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
