#28: 
This is a cleaned up verison of my original patch.
                     ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#106: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1493:
+static int find_lowest_cpu(cpumask_t *cpu_mask, struct task_struct *task,
+				 struct rq *this_rq)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#158: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1545:

+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#198: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1585:
+^Idst_cpu = find_lowest_cpu(&cpu_mask, next_task, this_rq); $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#277: FILE: kernel/sched_rt.c:107:
+	if (likely (rq->rt_nr_running < 2))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'rq->rt_nr_running < 2'
#277: FILE: kernel/sched_rt.c:107:
+	if (likely (rq->rt_nr_running < 2))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
