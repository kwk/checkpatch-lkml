CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#59: FILE: block/cfq-cgroup.c:64:
+static void cfq_meta_data_sibling_tree_add(struct cfq_meta_data *cfqmd,
+					     struct cfq_data *cfqd)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#64: FILE: block/cfq-cgroup.c:69:
+	BUG_ON(!RB_EMPTY_NODE(&cfqd->sib_node));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#75: FILE: block/cfq-cgroup.c:80:
+		if (cfqd < __cfqd) {
[...]
+		} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#82: FILE: block/cfq-cgroup.c:87:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
