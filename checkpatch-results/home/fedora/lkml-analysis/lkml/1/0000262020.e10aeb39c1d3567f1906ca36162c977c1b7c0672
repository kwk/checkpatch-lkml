CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#431: FILE: drivers/net/igb/e1000_82575.h:148:
+#define E1000_DCA_TXCTRL_TX_WB_RO_EN (1 << 11) /* Tx Desc writeback RO bit */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

 	                                        ^
