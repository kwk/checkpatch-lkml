WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'explictly' may be misspelled - perhaps 'explicitly'?
#44: 
Check the return values, and explictly tell gcc to silence that warning.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#60: FILE: fs/nfs/callback_xdr.c:404:
+	struct cb_compound_hdr_arg uninitialized_var(hdr_arg);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'hdr_arg' should also have an identifier name
#60: FILE: fs/nfs/callback_xdr.c:404:
+	struct cb_compound_hdr_arg uninitialized_var(hdr_arg);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
