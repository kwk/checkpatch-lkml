WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#229: FILE: block/blk-core.c:905:
+	BUG_ON(blk_queued_rq(rq));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern struct request *blk_peek_request(struct request_queue *q);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
