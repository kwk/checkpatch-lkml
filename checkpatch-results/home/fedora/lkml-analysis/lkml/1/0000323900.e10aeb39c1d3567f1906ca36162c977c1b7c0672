+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo __read_mostly	bar" should be "foo __read_mostly bar"
#131: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_sched_switch.c:18:
+static int __read_mostly	tracer_enabled;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#219: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_sched_switch.c:106:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
