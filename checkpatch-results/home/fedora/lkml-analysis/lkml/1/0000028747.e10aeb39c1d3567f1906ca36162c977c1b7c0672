WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct drm_encoder_helper_funcs should normally be const
#53: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/drm_crtc_helper.c:1166:
+	struct drm_encoder_helper_funcs *encoder_funcs;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#66: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/drm_crtc_helper.c:1184:
+			list_for_each_entry(encoder, &dev->mode_config.encoder_list, head) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#67: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/drm_crtc_helper.c:1185:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#73: FILE: drivers/gpu/drm/drm_crtc_helper.c:1191:
+								drm_helper_choose_encoder_dpms(encoder));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
