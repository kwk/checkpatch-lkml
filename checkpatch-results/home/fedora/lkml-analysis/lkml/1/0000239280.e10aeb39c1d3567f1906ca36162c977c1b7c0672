CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#82: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp.h:103:
+extern struct slot *alloc_slot_struct(struct device_node *dn, int drc_index, int power_domain);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rpaphp_register_slot', this function's name, in a string
#223: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp_slot.c:124:
+		err("rpaphp_register_slot: slot[%s] is already registered\n", slot_name(slot));

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
