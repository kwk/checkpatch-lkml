WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#85: FILE: fs/debugfs/inode.c:34:
+extern struct inode_operations debugfs_link_operations;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#85: FILE: fs/debugfs/inode.c:34:
+extern struct inode_operations debugfs_link_operations;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:EXPORTED_WORLD_WRITABLE: Exporting world writable files is usually an error. Consider more restrictive permissions.
#170: FILE: fs/debugfs/inode.c:314:
+	result = debugfs_create_file(name, S_IFLNK | S_IRWXUGO, parent, link,

Exporting world writable sysfs/debugfs files is usually a bad thing.
When done arbitrarily they can introduce serious security bugs.
In the past, some of the debugfs vulnerabilities would seemingly allow
any local user to write arbitrary values into device registers - a
situation from which little good can be expected to emerge.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRWXUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0777'.
#170: FILE: fs/debugfs/inode.c:314:
+	result = debugfs_create_file(name, S_IFLNK | S_IRWXUGO, parent, link,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
