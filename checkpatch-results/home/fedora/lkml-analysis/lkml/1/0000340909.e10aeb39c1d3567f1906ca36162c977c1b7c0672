#31: 
The behaviour of eject/lock_door ioctl is not consistent, so add some check before scsi_cmd_ioctl.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#49: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:2242:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
