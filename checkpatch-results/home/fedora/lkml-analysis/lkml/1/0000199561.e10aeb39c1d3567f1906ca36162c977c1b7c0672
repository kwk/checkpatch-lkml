CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#67: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:189:
+	scan_base = offset = si->cluster_next;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#85: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:220:
+			scan_base = offset = si->lowest_bit;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#97: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:246:
+			if (si->swap_map[offset])
[...]
+			else if (offset == last_in_cluster) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
