Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#78: FILE: include/net/ax88796.h:18:
+#define AXFLG_MAC_FROMPLATFORM		(1<<3)	/* MAC given by platform data */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#93: FILE: include/net/ax88796.h:28:
+	u8		*mac_addr;	/* MAC addr (only used when
+					   AXFLG_MAC_FROMPLATFORM is used */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
