#40: 
A novel design which incorporates a foreground-background descending priority

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#697: FILE: kernel/sched.c:713:
+	p->prio = p->normal_prio = p->static_prio;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#721: FILE: kernel/sched.c:737:
+	if (p->rotation == rq->prio_rotation) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

it for you.
