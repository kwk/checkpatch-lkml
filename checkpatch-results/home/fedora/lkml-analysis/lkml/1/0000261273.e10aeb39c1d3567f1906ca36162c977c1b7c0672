The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#75: FILE: drivers/video/via/iface.c:31:
+	if (via_fb_memsize)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'viafb_ioctl_hotplug', this function's name, in a string
#250: FILE: drivers/video/via/ioctl.c:82:

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
