CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:58:
+extern void mem_cgroup_uncharge_batch_start(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'ctype == MEM_CGROUP_CHARGE_TYPE_SWAPOUT'
#102: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1846:
+	if (do_swap_account && (ctype == MEM_CGROUP_CHARGE_TYPE_SWAPOUT))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!batch->memcg"
#109: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1853:
+		if (batch->memcg == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
