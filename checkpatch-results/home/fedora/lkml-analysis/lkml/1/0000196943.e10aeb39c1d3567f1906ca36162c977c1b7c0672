#35: 
Currently, /proc/sys/vm/swappiness can change swappiness ratio for global reclaim.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cgrp->parent"
#81: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:642:
+	if (cgrp->parent == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#152: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1666:
+		progress = try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages(mem, GFP_KERNEL,
+						false, get_swappiness(mem));

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#172: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1898:
+	struct mem_cgroup *parent;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cgrp->parent"
#175: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1901:
+	if (cgrp->parent == NULL)

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'parent->use_hierarchy'
#180: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:1906:
+	if ((parent->use_hierarchy) ||
+	    (memcg->use_hierarchy && !list_empty(&cgrp->children)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
