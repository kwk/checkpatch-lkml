WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'baboon_irq', this function's name, in a string
#68: FILE: arch/m68k/mac/baboon.c:72:
+	printk("baboon_irq: mb_control %02X mb_ifr %02X mb_status %02X\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
