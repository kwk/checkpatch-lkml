Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#84: FILE: include/asm-i386/smp.h:95:
+extern int smp_call_function_mask(cpumask_t mask,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
