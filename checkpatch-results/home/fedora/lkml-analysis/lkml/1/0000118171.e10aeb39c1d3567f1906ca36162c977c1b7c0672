Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#353: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/aq100x.c:293:
+		if (err || v == 0xffff) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#405: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/aq100x.c:345:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
