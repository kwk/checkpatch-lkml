WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#68: FILE: include/asm-x86/tlbflush.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#102: FILE: include/asm-x86/tlbflush.h:35:
+extern void flush_tlb_all(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#104: FILE: include/asm-x86/tlbflush.h:37:
+extern void flush_tlb_mm(struct mm_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
