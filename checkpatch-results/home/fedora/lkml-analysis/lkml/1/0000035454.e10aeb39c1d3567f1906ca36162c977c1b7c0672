CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements

+			    IRQF_DISABLED, DEV_NAME" - WSS", chip);

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#226: FILE: sound/pci/hda/hda_proc.c:243:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
