WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#37: 
# cat /debug/tracing/stack_trace 

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

+static unsigned long stack_dump_trace[STACK_TRACE_ENTRIES+1] =

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#161: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_stack.c:83:
+				this_size = stack_dump_index[i++] =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#234: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_stack.c:239:
+		seq_printf(m, "        Depth   Size      Location"
+			   "    (%d entries)\n"

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
