 arch/{i386/Makefile => x86/Makefile_32}            |    4 ++--

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#111: FILE: Makefile:424:
+include $(srctree)/arch/$(SRCARCH)/Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
