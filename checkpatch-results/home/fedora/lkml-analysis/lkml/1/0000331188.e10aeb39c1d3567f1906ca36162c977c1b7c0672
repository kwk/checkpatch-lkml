CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: fs/ext2/ext2.h:142:
+extern long ext2_ioctl(struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#59: FILE: fs/ext2/ext2.h:142:
+extern long ext2_ioctl(struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name
#59: FILE: fs/ext2/ext2.h:142:
+extern long ext2_ioctl(struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#95: FILE: fs/ext2/ioctl.c:20:
+long ext2_ioctl(struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
