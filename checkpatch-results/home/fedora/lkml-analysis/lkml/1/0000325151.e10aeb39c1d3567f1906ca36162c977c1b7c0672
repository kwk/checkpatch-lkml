#26: 
It's possible that the caller of sysfs_remove_group messed up and passed in an attribute group that was not really registered to this kobject.  But don't panic for such a foolish error, spit out a warning about what happened, and continue on our way safely.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#45: FILE: fs/sysfs/group.c:81:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "sysfs group %p not found for "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#46: FILE: fs/sysfs/group.c:82:

+				"kobject '%s'\n", grp, kobject_name(kobj));

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
