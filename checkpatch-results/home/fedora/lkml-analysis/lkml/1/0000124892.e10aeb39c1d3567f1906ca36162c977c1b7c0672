2.6.29-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#95: FILE: include/net/netlabel.h:547:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dom_entry"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
