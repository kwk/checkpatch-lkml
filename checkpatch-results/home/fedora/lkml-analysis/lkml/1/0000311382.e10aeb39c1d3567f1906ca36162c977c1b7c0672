WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/cpufeature.h> instead of <asm/cpufeature.h>
#43: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/feature_names.c:7:
+#include <asm/cpufeature.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
