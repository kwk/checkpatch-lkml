#29: 
The PV featured HVM(once known as Hybrid) is started from real mode like HVM

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#60: FILE: arch/x86/include/asm/xen/cpuid.h:69:
+#define XEN_CPUID_FEAT2_HVM_PV (1u<<0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#172: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1282:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
