CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#306: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:339:
+extern void mem_cgroup_fixup_swapcache(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#312: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:345:
 }
+static inline void

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
