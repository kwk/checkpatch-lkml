CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#192: FILE: include/linux/device.h:525:
+extern void destroy_suspended_device(struct class *cls, dev_t devt);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#210: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:23:
+extern void device_pm_destroy_suspended(struct device *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct device *' should also have an identifier name
#210: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:23:
+extern void device_pm_destroy_suspended(struct device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
