CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "mem"
#73: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma_32.c:38:
+	return (mem != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#91: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma_32.c:56:
+void *dma_alloc_coherent(struct device *dev, size_t size,
+			   dma_addr_t *dma_handle, gfp_t gfp)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#139: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma_64.c:55:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
