Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#96: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-calgary.c:848:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
