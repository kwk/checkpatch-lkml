+	  This adds a driver to safely access the System Management Mode of

+	  not work on models with a Phoenix BIOS. The System Management Mode
+	  is used to set the BIOS and power saving options on Toshiba portables.

+	  For information on utilities to make use of this driver see the
+	  Toshiba Linux utilities web site at:
+	  <http://www.buzzard.org.uk/toshiba/>.

+	  Say Y if you intend to run this kernel on a Toshiba portable.
+	  Say N otherwise.
