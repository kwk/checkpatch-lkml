WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#55: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.c:2952:
+		pr_warning("Could not create debugfs "
+			   "'trace_bprintk_formats' entry\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#69: FILE: kernel/trace/trace.h:131:
+extern struct file_operations trace_bprintk_fmt_fops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#82: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_bprintk.c:160:
+extern char *__start___trace_bprintk_fmt[], *__stop___trace_bprintk_fmt[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#133: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_bprintk.c:211:
+static struct seq_operations trace_bprintk_fmt_seq_ops = {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#143: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_bprintk.c:221:
+	int ret = seq_open(file, &trace_bprintk_fmt_seq_ops);
+	if (!ret)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
