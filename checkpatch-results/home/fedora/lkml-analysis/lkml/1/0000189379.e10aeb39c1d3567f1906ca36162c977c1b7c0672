Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#116: FILE: checkpoint/restart.c:287:
+	if (parent < 0) {
[...]
+	} else if (parent != 0)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#353: FILE: checkpoint/sys.c:170:
+	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&ctx->refcount));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#497: FILE: include/linux/checkpoint.h:72:
+extern void cr_ctx_get(struct cr_ctx *ctx);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
