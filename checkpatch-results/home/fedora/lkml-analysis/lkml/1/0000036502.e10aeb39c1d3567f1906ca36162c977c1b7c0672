While doing some stress testing on my box, I enountered following.
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#119: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:2148:
+		if (cfqq->cfqg->nr_cfqq == 1 && RB_EMPTY_ROOT(&cfqq->sort_list)
[...]
-		else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
