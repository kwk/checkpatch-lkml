ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#47: FILE: fs/efs/super.c:252:
+ ^Isb = kzalloc(sizeof(struct efs_sb_info), GFP_KERNEL);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#47: FILE: fs/efs/super.c:252:
+ ^Isb = kzalloc(sizeof(struct efs_sb_info), GFP_KERNEL);$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#47: FILE: fs/efs/super.c:252:
+ ^Isb = kzalloc(sizeof(struct efs_sb_info), GFP_KERNEL);$

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*sb)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct efs_sb_info)...)
#47: FILE: fs/efs/super.c:252:
+ 	sb = kzalloc(sizeof(struct efs_sb_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
