Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#169: FILE: drivers/misc/ti_dac7512.c:37:
+	if (strict_strtoul(buf, 10, &val) < 0)

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'dac7512_store_val' to 'value_store'
#176: FILE: drivers/misc/ti_dac7512.c:44:
+}

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0200'.
#178: FILE: drivers/misc/ti_dac7512.c:46:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(value, S_IWUSR, NULL, dac7512_store_val);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
