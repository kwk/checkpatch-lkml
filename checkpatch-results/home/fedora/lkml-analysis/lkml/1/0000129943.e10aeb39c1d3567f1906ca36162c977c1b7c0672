WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'lowmem_shrink', this function's name, in a string
#52: FILE: drivers/staging/android/lowmemorykiller.c:76:
+		lowmem_print(5, "lowmem_shrink %d, %x, return %d\n", nr_to_scan, gfp_mask, rem);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#87: FILE: drivers/staging/android/lowmemorykiller.c:97:
+^I^I             p->pid, p->comm, p->oomkilladj, tasksize);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
