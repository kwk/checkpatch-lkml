CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#105: FILE: fs/cifs/file.c:798:
+	open_file = (struct cifsFileInfo *) file->private_data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <cifsFileInfo>
#105: FILE: fs/cifs/file.c:798:
+	open_file = (struct cifsFileInfo *) file->private_data;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#144: FILE: fs/cifs/file.c:859:
+	inode->i_ctime = inode->i_mtime =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#149: FILE: fs/cifs/file.c:864:
+			i_size_write(file->f_path.dentry->d_inode,
+			*poffset);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#215: FILE: fs/cifs/file.c:974:
+/*	file->f_path.dentry->d_inode->i_ctime =
+	file->f_path.dentry->d_inode->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
