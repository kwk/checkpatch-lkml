Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#162: FILE: include/linux/perf_counter.h:613:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#255: FILE: kernel/perf_counter.c:3071:
+	if ((counter->attr.exclude_kernel || !data.regs) &&
 			!counter->attr.exclude_user)
