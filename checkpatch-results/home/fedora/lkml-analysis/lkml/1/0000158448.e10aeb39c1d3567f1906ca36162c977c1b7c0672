ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#40: 
--- a/drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c	2009-03-03 23:35:15.000000000 +0100

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "str"
#56: FILE: drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c:215:
+	if (str != NULL && *str != '\0') {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#57: FILE: drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c:216:
+		ehci_ho_to = simple_strtol(str, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#58: FILE: drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c:217:
+		if (ehci_ho_to < 10) ehci_ho_to = 10;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#63: FILE: drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c:222:

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
