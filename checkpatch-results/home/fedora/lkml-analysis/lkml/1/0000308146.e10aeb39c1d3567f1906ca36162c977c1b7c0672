WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 125 exceeds 100 columns
#61: FILE: drivers/watchdog/w83697hf_wdt.c:68:
+MODULE_PARM_DESC(early_disable, "Watchdog gets disabled at boot time (default=" __MODULE_STRING(WATCHDOG_EARLY_DISABLE) ")");

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
