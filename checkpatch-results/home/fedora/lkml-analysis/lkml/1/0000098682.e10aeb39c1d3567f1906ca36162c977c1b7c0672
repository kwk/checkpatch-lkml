Subject: [PATCH 3/3] staging/rt*: don't confuse user of rt3070 driver with rt2870 strings

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#82: FILE: drivers/staging/rt2860/rt_linux.h:97:
+/* order of "if defined()" is important, because for 3070 driver
+   both RT2870 and RT3070 are defined */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 153 exceeds 100 columns
#137: FILE: drivers/staging/rt2870/2870_main_dev.c:1421:
+		printk(RT28xx_CHIP_NAME "_BssBeaconStart:BeaconFactor=%d, BeaconRemain=%d!\n", pAd->CommonCfg.BeaconFactor, pAd->CommonCfg.BeaconRemain);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
