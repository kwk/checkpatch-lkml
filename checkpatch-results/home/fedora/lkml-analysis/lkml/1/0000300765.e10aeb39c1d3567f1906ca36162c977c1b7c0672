CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#149: FILE: include/linux/memcontrol.h:48:
+extern struct mem_cgroup *mem_cgroup_from_task(struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#216: FILE: mm/memcontrol.c:467:
+	BUG_ON(!mem_cont);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
