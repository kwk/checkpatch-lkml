#29: 
A non-urgent and somwhat ugly patch; please review, and if 
                 ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#71: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:135:
+			int make_link = 0;
+			if (list_empty(&dev->subordinate->node)) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#75: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:139:
+				list_add_tail(&dev->subordinate->node,
 					       &dev->bus->children);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#83: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:145:
+				retval = sysfs_create_link(&dev->subordinate->class_dev.kobj,
 						   &dev->dev.kobj, "bridge");

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#89: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:148:
+					dev_err(&dev->dev, "Error creating sysfs "
+						"bridge symlink, continuing...\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
