CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#171: FILE: fs/ext2/inode.c:1488:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#181: FILE: fs/ext2/inode.c:1498:
+	inode->i_mtime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME_SEC;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#184: FILE: fs/ext2/inode.c:1501:
+		ext2_sync_inode (inode);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#333: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:2335:
+extern int simple_setsize(struct inode *inode, loff_t newsize);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
