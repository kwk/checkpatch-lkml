WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#43: FILE: arch/sparc/include/asm/mdesc.h:75:
+extern void mdesc_populate_present_mask(cpumask_t *mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 131 exceeds 100 columns
#129: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/mdesc.c:763:
+static void * __cpuinit mdesc_iterate_over_cpus(void *(*func)(struct mdesc_handle *, u64, int, void *), void *arg, cpumask_t *mask)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
