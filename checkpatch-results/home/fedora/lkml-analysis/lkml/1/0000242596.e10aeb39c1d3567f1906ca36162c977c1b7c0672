Subject: [PATCH 38/42] seperate irq_descX with irq_descX_free
                       ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#90: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:226:
+	for (desc = irq_descX, irqX = desc->irq; desc; desc = desc->next, irqX = desc ? desc->irq: -1U)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#165: FILE: kernel/irq/handle.c:179:
+	desc_pri = desc = irq_descX;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
