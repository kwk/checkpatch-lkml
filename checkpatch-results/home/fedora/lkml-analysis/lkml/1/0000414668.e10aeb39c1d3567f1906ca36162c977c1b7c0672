CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Xgt_desc_struct>
#229: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/paravirt.c:311:
+static fastcall void native_load_gdt(const struct Xgt_desc_struct *dtr)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#361: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/paravirt.c:435:
+static fastcall void native_set_pte_present(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long addr, pte_t *ptep, pte_t pte)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
