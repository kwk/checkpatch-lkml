WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#20: 
Subject: [PATCH] Staging: asus_oled: changes spaces to tabs in asus_oled.c Ran checkpatch.pl as per TODO mentioned that one line had spaces, fixed it. Signed-off-by: M. Willis Monroe <willismonroe@gmail.com>

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.
