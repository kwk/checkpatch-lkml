Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
