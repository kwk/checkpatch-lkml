CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/mc146818rtc.h> instead of <asm/mc146818rtc.h>
#81: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/rtc.c:12:
+#include <asm/mc146818rtc.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#89: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/rtc.c:203:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
