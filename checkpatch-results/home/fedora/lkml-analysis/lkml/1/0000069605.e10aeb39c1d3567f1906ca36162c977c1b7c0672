WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#143: FILE: fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:945:
+static struct dentry_operations hugetlb_unlinked_dentry_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

#211: FILE: fs/namespace.c:836:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
