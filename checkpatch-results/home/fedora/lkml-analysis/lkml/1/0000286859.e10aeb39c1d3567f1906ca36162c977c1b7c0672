WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#38: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .6
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#71: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capidrv.c:2340:
+		rev[sizeof(rev)-1] = 0;
 		               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#72: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capidrv.c:2341:
+		if ((p = strchr(rev, '$')) != 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#114: FILE: drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-ioctl.c:731:
+^I^I^I^Isizeof(vcap->card)-1); ^I    /* card type */$

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#114: FILE: drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-ioctl.c:731:
+		strncpy(vcap->card, itv->card_name,
+				sizeof(vcap->card)-1); 	    /* card type */

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#114: FILE: drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-ioctl.c:731:
+				sizeof(vcap->card)-1); 	    /* card type */
 				                  ^

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#128: FILE: drivers/net/tehuti.c:630:
+	return (offset > (u32) (BDX_REGS_SIZE / priv->nic->port_num)) ?

WARNING:IF_0: Consider removing the code enclosed by this #if 0 and its #endif
#181: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:847:
+#if 0

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#222: FILE: fs/dnotify.c:102:
+	 * between accesses to descriptor table and ->i_dnotify */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#223: FILE: fs/dnotify.c:103:
+	if (f != filp)
 	         ^^^^
