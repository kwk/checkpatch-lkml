#41: 
Subject: [PATCH][cfq-cgroups] Introduce cgroups structure with ioprio entry.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Do not use whitespace before Signed-off-by:
#49: 
    Signed-off-by: Satoshi UCHIDA <s-uchida@ap.jp.nec.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*cfqc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct cfq_cgroup)...)
#96: FILE: block/cfq-cgroup.c:50:
+	cfqc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct cfq_cgroup), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:QUOTED_WHITESPACE_BEFORE_NEWLINE: unnecessary whitespace before a quoted newline
#134: FILE: block/cfq-cgroup.c:88:
+	ret = snprintf(page, PAGE_SIZE, "%d \n", cfqc->ioprio);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buffer"
#165: FILE: block/cfq-cgroup.c:119:
+	if (buffer == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: strict_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#174: FILE: block/cfq-cgroup.c:128:
+	err = strict_strtoul(buffer, 10, &new_prio);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'new_prio < 0'
#175: FILE: block/cfq-cgroup.c:129:
+	if ((err) || ((new_prio < 0) || (new_prio > CFQ_CGROUP_MAX_IOPRIO))) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'new_prio > CFQ_CGROUP_MAX_IOPRIO'
#175: FILE: block/cfq-cgroup.c:129:
+	if ((err) || ((new_prio < 0) || (new_prio > CFQ_CGROUP_MAX_IOPRIO))) {
