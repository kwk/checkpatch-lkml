#29: 
The new function supports batch_size and custom sized seqfile/private buffers.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#45: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:182:
+static int generic_maps_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *file,
+			struct seq_operations *ops, unsigned long batch_size,

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#45: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:182:
+			struct seq_operations *ops, unsigned long batch_size,

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
