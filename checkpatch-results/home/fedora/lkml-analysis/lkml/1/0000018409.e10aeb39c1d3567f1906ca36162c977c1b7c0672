WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'v' - possible side-effects?

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#187: FILE: drivers/ata/ata-timings.c:128:
+		if (speed >= XFER_PIO_0 && speed < XFER_SW_DMA_0) {
[...]
+		} else if (speed >= XFER_MW_DMA_0 && speed <= XFER_MW_DMA_2)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#189: FILE: drivers/ata/ata-timings.c:130:
+				p.cycle = p.cyc8b = id[ATA_ID_EIDE_PIO];

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#192: FILE: drivers/ata/ata-timings.c:133:
+				p.cycle = p.cyc8b = id[ATA_ID_EIDE_PIO_IORDY];

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#231: FILE: drivers/ata/ata-timings.c:172:
+	/* In a few cases quantisation may produce enough errors to

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
