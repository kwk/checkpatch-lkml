Subject: [PATCH 065/148] include/asm-x86/mc146818rtc.h: checkpatch cleanups - formatting only

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while loop
#71: FILE: include/asm-x86/mc146818rtc.h:77:
+#define lock_cmos_suffix(reg)			\
+	unlock_cmos();				\
+	local_irq_restore(cmos_flags);		\
 	} while (0)

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)
