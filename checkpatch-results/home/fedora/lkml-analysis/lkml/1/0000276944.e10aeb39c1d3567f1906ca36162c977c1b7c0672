#25: 
memmove() is unnecessary in cgroup_path(), the following patch will remove it.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#79: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:1179:
+		if ((start -= len) < *buf)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#130: FILE: kernel/cgroup.c:3089:
+		pathbuf = path = kmalloc(PAGE_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
