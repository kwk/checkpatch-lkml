CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#63: FILE: drivers/net/macvlan.c:120:
+static inline void macvlan_count_rx(const struct macvlan_dev *vlan, int length,
+			     int success, int multicast)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "skb"
#154: FILE: drivers/net/macvlan.c:197:
+	macvlan_count_rx(vlan, skb->len + ETH_HLEN, likely(skb != NULL), 0);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
