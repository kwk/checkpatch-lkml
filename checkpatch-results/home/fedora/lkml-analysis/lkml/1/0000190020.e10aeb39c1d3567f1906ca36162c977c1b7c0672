WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 127 exceeds 100 columns
#74: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dir.c:108:
+#define ocfs2_trailer_from_bh(_bh, _sb) ((struct ocfs2_dir_block_trailer *) ((_bh)->b_data + ocfs2_dir_trailer_blk_off((_sb))))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
