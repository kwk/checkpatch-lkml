commit a9e7f4472075fb6937c545af3f6329e9946bbe66 upstream.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: fs/ext4/ext4.h:1439:
+extern qsize_t *ext4_get_reserved_space(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
