CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "user_pgd"
#78: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:855:
+		if (user_pgd != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#103: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1117:
+	/* Replicate changes to map the vsyscall page into the user
+	   pagetable vsyscall mapping. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#103: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1117:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#106: FILE: arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:1120:
+		unsigned long vaddr = __fix_to_virt(idx);
+		set_pte_vaddr_pud(level3_user_vsyscall, vaddr, pte);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
