ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#96: FILE: fs/dcache.c:297:
+  ^Ireturn;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#96: FILE: fs/dcache.c:297:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#96: FILE: fs/dcache.c:297:
+  ^Ireturn;$

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#107: FILE: fs/dcache.c:306:
+		BUG_ON(parent == dentry);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
