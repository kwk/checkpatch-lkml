Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#87: FILE: super.c:141:
+ * This is almost a copy of get_sb_bdev in fs/super.c.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#107: FILE: super.c:161:
+int btrfs_get_sb_bdev(struct file_system_type *fs_type,
+	int flags, const char *dev_name, void *data,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
