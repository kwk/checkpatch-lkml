WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'it'
#100: 
code won't call into module it it sees NULL ->proc_fops.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#107: 
Unfortunately, fixing races of type #2 will require changing in some modules.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'dissapear' may be misspelled - perhaps 'disappear'?
#204: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:247:
+	 * Bump refcount so that module won't dissapear while ->write_proc
 	                                      ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:MSLEEP: msleep < 20ms can sleep for up to 20ms; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#238: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:777:
+			msleep(1);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#272: FILE: include/linux/proc_fs.h:83:
+				 * ->read_proc, ->write_proc, ->get_info */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
