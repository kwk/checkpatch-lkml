#30: 
D: a reference and ignoring the fact that the module is being "rmmod --wait"ed

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#71: FILE: include/linux/module.h:270:
+/* Sometimes we know we already have a refcount, and it's easier not
+   to handle the error case (which only happens with rmmod --wait). */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#75: FILE: include/linux/module.h:274:
+		BUG_ON(module_refcount(module) == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

+static inline void __module_get(struct module *module)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
