WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#50: FILE: drivers/char/sysrq.c:31:
+extern int sysrq_oom;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#59: FILE: drivers/char/sysrq.c:142:
+		printk("Trying to free some memory killing a \"bad\" process\n");

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#60: FILE: drivers/char/sysrq.c:143:
+^I ^Isysrq_oom = 1;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#60: FILE: drivers/char/sysrq.c:143:
+^I ^Isysrq_oom = 1;$

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#82: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:27:
+int sysrq_oom = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
