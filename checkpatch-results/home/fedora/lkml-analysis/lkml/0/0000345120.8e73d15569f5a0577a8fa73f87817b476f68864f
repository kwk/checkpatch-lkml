ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#37: 
--- a/drivers/pcmcia/i82365.c	Fri Aug 15 11:16:00 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#70: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta_socket.c:902:
+	if (!socket->cb_irq || request_irq(socket->cb_irq, yenta_interrupt, SA_SHIRQ, pci_name(socket->dev), socket)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
