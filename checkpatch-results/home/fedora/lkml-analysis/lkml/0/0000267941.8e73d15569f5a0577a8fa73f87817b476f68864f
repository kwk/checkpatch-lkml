WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:NEW_TYPEDEFS: do not add new typedefs
#34: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:177:
+typedef enum {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#44: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:187:
+extern pageout_t pageout(struct page *, struct address_space *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#44: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:187:
+extern pageout_t pageout(struct page *, struct address_space *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct address_space *' should also have an identifier name
#44: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:187:
+extern pageout_t pageout(struct page *, struct address_space *);
