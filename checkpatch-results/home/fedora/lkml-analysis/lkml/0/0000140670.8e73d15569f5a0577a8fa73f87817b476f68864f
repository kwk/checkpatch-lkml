#32: 
though I'm patching the current file, I am in favor of the recent RNG rewrite

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#49: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random.c:2:
+        Added support for the AMD Geode LX RNG$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#107: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random.c:486:
+static void __iomem *geode_rng_base = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "geode_rng_base"
#115: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random.c:494:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
