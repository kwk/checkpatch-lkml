#24: 
I've taken the CD-audio-DMA patch from Andrew Morton and made it available as a config option. You're now able to choose whether you still want the old code which uses PIO or the new code which decreases CPU load (on some systems up to 70%) and improves total time of read.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#262: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:1459:
+	if (rq->bh) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
