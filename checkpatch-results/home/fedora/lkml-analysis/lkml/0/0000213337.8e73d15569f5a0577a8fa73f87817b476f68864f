#27: 
Add optional callback before each device gets suspended (called 'presuspend').

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#34: 
Signed-Off-By: Alasdair G Kergon <agk@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#66: FILE: drivers/md/dm-table.c:852:
+static void suspend_targets(struct dm_table *t, unsigned postsuspend)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#75: FILE: drivers/md/dm-table.c:858:
+		if (postsuspend) {
[...]
+		} else if (ti->type->presuspend)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
