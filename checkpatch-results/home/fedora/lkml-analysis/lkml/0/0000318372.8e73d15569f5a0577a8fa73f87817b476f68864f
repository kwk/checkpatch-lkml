#29: 
This patch is based on the lm_sensors project CVS, from revisions 1.45 and 1.1

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#90: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/lm75.c:96:
+	int temp = simple_strtoul(buf, NULL, 10);		\

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.

spaces are never used for indentation.

+    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
