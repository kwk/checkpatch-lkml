             ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#42: FILE: fs/namespace.c:27:
+extern int __init init_rootfs(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
