Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#166: FILE: include/media/tuner.h:214:
+extern int xc3028_init(struct i2c_client *c);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
