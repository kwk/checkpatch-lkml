#33: 
accepts a string parameter @delims which specify delimeters.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'delimeters' may be misspelled - perhaps 'delimiters'?
#34: 
param_array_delims() also supports backslash escaping of delimeters.

#114: FILE: kernel/params.c:298:
+	/* We expect a list of values which are separated by any of

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
