#27: 
This makes module removal messy, because we can't deallocate the connections

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#79: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:642:
+	 * infrastructure. It's released at module unload. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#190: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:1411:
+	port = (struct veth_port*)netdev_priv(dev);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
