ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#89: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-ali1563.c:65:
+static int ali1563_transaction(struct i2c_adapter * a, int size)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'size != HST_CNTL2_QUICK'
#124: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-ali1563.c:108:
+	if ((data & HST_STS_DEVERR) && (size != HST_CNTL2_QUICK)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#124: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-ali1563.c:108:
+	if ((data & HST_STS_DEVERR) && (size != HST_CNTL2_QUICK)) {
+		dev_err(&a->dev, "Device error!\n");
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
