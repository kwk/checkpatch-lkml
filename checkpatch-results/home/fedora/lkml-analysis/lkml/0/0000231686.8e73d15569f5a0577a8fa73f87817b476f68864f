ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#157: FILE: arch/i386/lib/kgdb_serial.c:346:
+extern raw_spinlock_t kgdb_spinlock;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
