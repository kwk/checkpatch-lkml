Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#38: 
Actually, you converted this code from "wrong" to "still wrong".  How's this?

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#112: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:288:
 	if (p < (unsigned long) high_memory) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#119: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:293:
+		written = do_write_mem((void*)p, p, buf, wrote, ppos);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
