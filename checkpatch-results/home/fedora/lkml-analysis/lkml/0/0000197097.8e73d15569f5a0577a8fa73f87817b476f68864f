WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#96: FILE: emumixer.c:611:

+			snd_emu10k1_ptr_write(emu, VTFT_VOLUMETARGET, mix->epcm->voices[ch]->number, mix->attn[0]);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns
#97: FILE: emumixer.c:612:
+			snd_emu10k1_ptr_write(emu, VTFT_VOLUMETARGET, mix->epcm->voices[ch]->number, mix->attn[0]);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
