CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#185: FILE: drivers/usb/input/wacom.c:376:
+				if (wacom->features->type == G4) {
[...]
+				} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 163 exceeds 100 columns
#368: FILE: drivers/usb/input/wacom.c:866:
+			input_dev->keybit[LONG(BTN_LEFT)] |= BIT(BTN_0) | BIT(BTN_1) | BIT(BTN_2) | BIT(BTN_3) | BIT(BTN_4) | BIT(BTN_5) | BIT(BTN_6) | BIT(BTN_7);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
