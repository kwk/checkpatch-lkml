The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'wich' may be misspelled - perhaps 'which'?

          ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#63: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/pcic.c:41:
+static void __devinit pci_fixup_igafb(struct pci_dev *dev)

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pci_fixup_igafb', this function's name, in a string
#65: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/pcic.c:43:
+	prom_printf("pci_fixup_igafb();\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
