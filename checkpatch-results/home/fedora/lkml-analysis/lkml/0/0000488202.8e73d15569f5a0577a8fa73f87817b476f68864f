#29: 
    This patch fixes a bug when mmap-write to a file tail and subsequent read cause written data to be lost

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#46: FILE: fs/reiserfs/inode.c:328:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#46: FILE: fs/reiserfs/inode.c:328:
+    } else 

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#48: FILE: fs/reiserfs/inode.c:330:
+	/*
+	** grab_tail_page can trigger calls to reiserfs_get_block on up to date

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
