#24: 
Get rid of the grepping for __st_ino in hostfs, since it doesn't work on x86_64

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#68: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs_user.c:31:
+	if(inode_out != NULL) *inode_out = buf.st_ino;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#68: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs_user.c:31:
+	if(inode_out != NULL) *inode_out = buf.st_ino;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "inode_out"
#68: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs_user.c:31:
+	if(inode_out != NULL) *inode_out = buf.st_ino;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
