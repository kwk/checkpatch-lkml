WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#33: 
#define NODE_DATA(nid)          (&contig_page_data)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
