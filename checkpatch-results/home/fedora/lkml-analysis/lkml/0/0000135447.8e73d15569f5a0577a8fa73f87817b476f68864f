CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#43: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:269:
+extern int unuse_vma(struct vm_area_struct *vma, swp_entry_t entry, struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#57: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:481:
+int unuse_vma(struct vm_area_struct *vma,
 				swp_entry_t entry, struct page *page)

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#117: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:984:
 		}
+		else {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#117: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:984:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
