WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#58: FILE: init/Kconfig:144:
+config SYS_FS
+	bool "/sys file system support" if EMBEDDED
+	default y

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

#123: FILE: include/linux/sysfs.h:36:
+sysfs_create_bin_file(struct kobject * kobj, struct bin_attribute * attr);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
