#25: 
I suggest to change the way IRQs are handed out to PCI devices. Currently, each I/O APIC pin gets associated with an IRQ, no matter if the pin is used or not. It is expected that each pin can potentually be engaged by a device inserted into the corresponding PCI slot. However, this imposes severe limitation on systems that have designs that employ many  I/O APICs, only utilizing couple lines of each, such as P64H2 chipset. It is used in ES7000, and currently, there is no way to boot the system with more that 9 I/O APICs. The simple change below allows to boot a system with say 64 (or more) I/O APICs, each providing 1 slot, which otherwise impossible because of the IRQ gaps created for unused lines on each I/O APIC. It does not resolve the problem with number of devices that exceeds number of possible IRQs, but eases up a tension for IRQs on any large system with potentually large number of devices. I only implemented this for the ACPI boot, since if the system is this big and
