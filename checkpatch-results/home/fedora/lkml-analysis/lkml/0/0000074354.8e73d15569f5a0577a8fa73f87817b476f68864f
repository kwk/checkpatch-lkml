ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#68: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/i8253.c:49:
+        /*$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#105: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/i8253.c:88:
+	if (count > old_count && jifs == old_jifs) {
+		count = old_count;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
