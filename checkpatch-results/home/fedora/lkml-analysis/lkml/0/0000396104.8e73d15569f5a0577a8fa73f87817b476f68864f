--- linux-2.5.59-lch2/arch/ppc/kernel/smp.c	17 Jan 2003 11:14:47 -0000	1.1.1.1

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#44: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/smp.c:446:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#50: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/smp.c:452:
+	BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/asm-ppc/smp.h:65:
+extern int __cpu_disable(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: include/asm-ppc/smp.h:66:
+extern void __cpu_die(unsigned int cpu);
