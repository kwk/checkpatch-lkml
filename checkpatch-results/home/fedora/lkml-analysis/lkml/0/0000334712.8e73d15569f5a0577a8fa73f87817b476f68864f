ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#47: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:480:
+#define PKT_CAN_SHARE_SKB	((void*)1)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
