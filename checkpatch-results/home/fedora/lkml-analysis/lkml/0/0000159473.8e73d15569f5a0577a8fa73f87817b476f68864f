Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "to_fp"
#74: FILE: arch/um/sys-x86_64/signal.c:117:
+	if(to_fp != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#76: FILE: arch/um/sys-x86_64/signal.c:119:
+	return(err);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
