ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pdev->image_ptr[i]"
#104: FILE: drivers/usb/media/pwc/pwc-ctrl.c:452:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#109: FILE: drivers/usb/media/pwc/pwc-ctrl.c:457:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
