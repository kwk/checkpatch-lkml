#25: 
bugfix for leaking IOPL to unprivileged processes when using sysenter/sysexit

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#51: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ioport.c:135:
+	struct thread_struct * t = &current->thread;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
