ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#46: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/main.c:79:
+static void setup_env_path(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
