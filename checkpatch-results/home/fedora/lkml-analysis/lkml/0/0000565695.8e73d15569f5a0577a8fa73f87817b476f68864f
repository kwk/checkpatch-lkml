CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/asm-i386/page.h:91:
+extern void do_BUG(const char *file, int line);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#113: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:27:
+extern int console_loglevel;

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#123: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:82:
+extern unsigned volatile int global_irq_lock;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#145: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:99:
+		int loglevel_save = console_loglevel;
+		oops_in_progress = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }
