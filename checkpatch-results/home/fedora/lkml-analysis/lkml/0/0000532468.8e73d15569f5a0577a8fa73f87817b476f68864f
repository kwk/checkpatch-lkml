	Takes allocation/initalization of vfsmounts into separate function.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*mnt)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct vfsmount)...)
#36: FILE: fs/super.c:287:
+	struct vfsmount *mnt = kmalloc(sizeof(struct vfsmount), GFP_KERNEL); 

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#37: FILE: fs/super.c:288:

+	if (mnt) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
