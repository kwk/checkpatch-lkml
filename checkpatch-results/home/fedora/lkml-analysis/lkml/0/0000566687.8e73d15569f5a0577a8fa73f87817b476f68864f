ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#98: FILE: drivers/usb/usb.c:639:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

  foo = bar(...);

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#98: FILE: drivers/usb/usb.c:639:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
