Subject: [patch 10/28] Input: convert drivers/macintosh to dynamic input_dev allocation

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#253: FILE: drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:716:
+	adbhid[id] = hid = kzalloc(sizeof(struct adbhid), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*hid)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct adbhid)...)
#253: FILE: drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:716:
+	adbhid[id] = hid = kzalloc(sizeof(struct adbhid), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#260: FILE: drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:722:
 
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#370: FILE: drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:797:
+		input_dev->keybit[LONG(BTN_MOUSE)] = BIT(BTN_LEFT) | BIT(BTN_MIDDLE) | BIT(BTN_RIGHT);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
