CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*brd->channels[i])...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct jsm_channel)...)
#84: FILE: drivers/serial/jsm/jsm_tty.c:392:
+			brd->channels[i] = kzalloc(sizeof(struct jsm_channel), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
