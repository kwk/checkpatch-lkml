CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#265: FILE: drivers/video/aty/atyfb_base.c:2392:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!video_options[i]"
#480: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:1312:
+			if (video_options[i] == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#1172: FILE: include/linux/fb.h:792:
+extern int fb_get_options(char *name, char **option);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
