Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 131 exceeds 100 columns
#162: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:444:
+			printk(KERN_CRIT "kernel tried to execute NX-protected page - exploit attempt? (uid: %d)\n", current->uid);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#182: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:440:
+int nx_enabled = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
