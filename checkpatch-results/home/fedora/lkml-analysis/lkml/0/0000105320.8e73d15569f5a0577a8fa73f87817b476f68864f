CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: include/linux/ktime.h:196:
+extern ktime_t ktime_add_nsec(ktime_t kt, u64 nsec);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#195: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:254:
+	dclc = dns = ktime_to_nsec(kt);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
#204: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:268:
+# define ktime_div_nsec(kt, div)	(unsigned long)((kt).tv64 / (div))
