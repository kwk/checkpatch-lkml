#29: 
# chcap cap_net_bind_service=ei /usr/sbin/sendmail

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#48: FILE: inhcaps.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#60: FILE: inhcaps.c:13:
+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'usage', this function's name, in a string
#73: FILE: inhcaps.c:26:
+	fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s capabilities uid[:gid] program [args]\n", argv[0]);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#87: FILE: inhcaps.c:40:
+	cap_t caps;
+	caps = cap_from_text(capstxt);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
