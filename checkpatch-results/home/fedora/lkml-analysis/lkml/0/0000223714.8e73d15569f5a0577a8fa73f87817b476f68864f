CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

+static int swsusp_swap_check(void) /* This is called before saving image */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#79: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:425:
+static struct highmem_page *highmem_copy = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#97: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:1064:
+static int bio_read_page(pgoff_t page_off, void * page)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
