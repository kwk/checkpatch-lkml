ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#36: 
--- a/drivers/net/wan/cosa.c	Tue Sep  9 15:45:31 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#76: FILE: drivers/net/wan/cosa.c:1049:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#77: FILE: drivers/net/wan/cosa.c:1050:
+	if (copy_from_user(&d, (void __user *) arg, sizeof(d)))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#87: FILE: drivers/net/wan/cosa.c:1058:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
