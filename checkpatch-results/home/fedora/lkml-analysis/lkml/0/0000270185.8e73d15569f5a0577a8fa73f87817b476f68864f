#204: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:119:

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#267: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:744:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#334: FILE: include/linux/seccomp.h:6:
+extern void secure_computing(int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
