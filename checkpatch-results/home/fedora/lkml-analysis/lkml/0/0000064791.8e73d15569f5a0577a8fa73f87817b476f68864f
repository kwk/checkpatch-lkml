CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:261:
+extern long rcu_batches_completed_bh(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'call_rcu_bh', prefer 'call_rcu' instead
#118: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:271:
+	call_rcu_bh(&p->rtort_rcu, rcu_torture_cb);

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#134: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:286:
 static struct rcu_torture_ops *torture_ops[] =
+	{ &rcu_ops, &rcu_bh_ops, NULL };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
