WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 168 exceeds 100 columns
#38: FILE: drivers/md/linear.c:165:
+		printk ("linear_make_request: Block %ld out of bounds on dev %s size %ld offset %ld\n", block, bdevname(tmp_dev->bdev), tmp_dev->size, tmp_dev->offset);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
