ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#58: FILE: ./sr_ioctl.c:87:
+                printk(KERN_ERR "Unable to allocate SCSI request in sr_do_ioctl");$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#85: FILE: ./sr_ioctl.c:266:
+ * the status of the unchecked_isa_dma flag in the host structure */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
