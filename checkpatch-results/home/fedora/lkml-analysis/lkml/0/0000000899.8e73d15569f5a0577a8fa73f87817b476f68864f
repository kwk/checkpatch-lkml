#69: FILE: init/Kconfig:44:
+config DEPRECATED
+	bool "Prompt for deprecated code/drivers"
+	---help---
+	  Code that has tagged as "deprecated" is officially still available
+	  for use but will typically have already been scheduled for removal
+	  at some point, so it's in your best interests to start looking for
+	  an alternative.
+
+config OBSOLETE
+	bool "Prompt for obsolete code/drivers"
+	---help---
+	  Code that has tagged as "obsolete" is officially no longer supported
+	  and shouldn't play a part in any normal build, but those features
+	  might still be available if you absolutely need access to them.
+
+	  It's *strongly* discouraged to continue to depend on obsolete code.

 config BROKEN
 	bool
