#26: 
   Some people have reported limited success by placing a multi-second delay

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#50: FILE: drivers/block/rd.c:710:
+	extern int blkdev_ops_exist(unsigned int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name
#50: FILE: drivers/block/rd.c:710:
+	extern int blkdev_ops_exist(unsigned int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#120: FILE: init/main.c:128:
+int usb_root_floppy_p = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#135: FILE: init/main.c:315:
+	extern int usb_root_floppy_p;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#136: FILE: init/main.c:316:
+	extern int usb_root_floppy_p;
+	root_dev_setup (line);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
