CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#41: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:489:
+extern void		synchronize_net(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#53: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2650:
+void synchronize_net(void) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#53: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2650:
+void synchronize_net(void) 

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
