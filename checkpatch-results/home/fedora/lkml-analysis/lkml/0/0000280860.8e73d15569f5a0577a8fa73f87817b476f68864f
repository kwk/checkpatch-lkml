#50: 
There is a uninitialized goal value being referenced in both ext3 and ext2 find goal block functions (ext3_find_goal() and ext2_find_goal()). In the non-sequential write case, these functions check the goal value(non zero) before calling ext3(2)_find_near() to find the goal block to allocate. Since the goal value is uninitialized(non zero), the ext3(2)_find_near() is never being called in the non-sequential write, thus ext3(2)_find_goal() failed to guide a goal block in the random write case. ext3(2)_new_block() takes the junk goal value and will turn it to goal 0 since it's normally beyond the filesystem block number limit. The fix is trivial.
