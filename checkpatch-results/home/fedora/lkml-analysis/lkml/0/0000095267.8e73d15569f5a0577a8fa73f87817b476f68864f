Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#56: FILE: include/net/scm.h:31:
+extern int scm_send(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, struct scm_cookie *scm);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#74: FILE: net/core/scm.c:118:
+	struct task_struct *tsk = current;
+	scm->creds = (struct ucred) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
