Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#165: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c:476:

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
