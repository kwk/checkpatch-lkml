CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#153: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dyn-tick.c:73:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#198: FILE: include/linux/dyn-tick.h:43:
+extern unsigned int dyn_tick_reprogram_timer(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#402: FILE: include/asm-i386/dyn-tick.h:23:
+#define DYN_TICK_APICABLE	(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
