+config EXT2_FS
+	tristate "Ext2 (Second extended) fs support"
+	---help---
+	  This is the de facto standard Linux file system (method to organize
+	  files on a storage device) for hard disks.
+
+	  You want to say Y here, unless you intend to use Linux exclusively
+	  from inside a DOS partition using the UMSDOS file system. The
+	  advantage of the latter is that you can get away without
+	  repartitioning your hard drive (which often implies backing
+	  everything up and restoring afterwards); the disadvantage is that
+	  Linux becomes susceptible to DOS viruses and that UMSDOS is somewhat
+	  slower than ext2fs. Even if you want to run Linux in this fashion,
+	  it might be a good idea to have ext2fs around: it enables you to
+	  read more floppy disks and facilitates the transition to a *real*
+	  Linux partition later. Another (rare) case which doesn't require
+	  ext2fs is a diskless Linux box which mounts all files over the
+	  network using NFS (in this case it's sufficient to say Y to "NFS
+	  file system support" below). Saying Y here will enlarge your kernel
+	  by about 44 KB.
+
+	  The Ext2fs-Undeletion mini-HOWTO, available from
+	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>, gives information about
+	  how to retrieve deleted files on ext2fs file systems.
+
+	  To change the behavior of ext2 file systems, you can use the tune2fs
+	  utility ("man tune2fs"). To modify attributes of files and
+	  directories on ext2 file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").
+
+	  Ext2fs partitions can be read from within DOS using the ext2tool
+	  command line tool package (available from
+	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/ext2/>) and from
+	  within Windows NT using the ext2nt command line tool package from
+	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/dos/>.  Explore2fs is a
+	  graphical explorer for ext2fs partitions which runs on Windows 95
+	  and Windows NT and includes experimental write support; it is
+	  available from
+	  <http://jnewbigin-pc.it.swin.edu.au/Linux/Explore2fs.htm>.
+
+	  If you want to compile this file system as a module ( = code which
+	  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
+	  want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
+	  module will be called ext2.o.  Be aware however that the file system
+	  of your root partition (the one containing the directory /) cannot
+	  be compiled as a module, and so this could be dangerous.  Most
+	  everyone wants to say Y here.
