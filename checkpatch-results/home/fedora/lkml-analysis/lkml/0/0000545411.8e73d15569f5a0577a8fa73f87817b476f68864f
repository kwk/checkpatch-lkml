ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#56: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mtrr.c:241:
+               Ugh, I broke AMD support.$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#75: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mtrr.c:1973:
 	switch (boot_cpu_data.x86_vendor) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
