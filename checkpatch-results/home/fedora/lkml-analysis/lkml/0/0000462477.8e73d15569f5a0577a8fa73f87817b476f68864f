WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#58: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1681:
+static volatile unsigned long migration_mask;

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#60: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1683:
+static int migration_thread(void * unused)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
