Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#104: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:700:
+extern int flock_lock_file_wait(struct file *filp, struct file_lock *fl);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
