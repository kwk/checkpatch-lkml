#41: 
It's not a problem with ACPI, it's more a problem with the interrupt routing 

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#68: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c:42:
+extern int acpi_irq_disabled;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#77: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c:386:
+	if (!acpi_irq_disabled) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#96: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:72:
+int acpi_irq_disabled = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
