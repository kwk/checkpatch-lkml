ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#41: 
--- a/kernel/sched.c	Fri Apr 12 04:16:07 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#56: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1681:
+static struct completion migration_complete
+			= COMPLETION_INITIALIZER(migration_complete);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

WARNING:YIELD: Using yield() is generally wrong. See yield() kernel-doc (sched/core.c)

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#102: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1732:
+^I * migration_thread to always find the unbound migration_thread $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#153: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1812:
+		if (kernel_thread(migration_thread, NULL,
+				CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGNAL) < 0)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#154: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1813:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
