WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'that'
#46: 
address that that pte maps is an extremely useful thing on ppc, since

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#73: FILE: mm/memory.c:875:
+		pte_t * pte = pte_alloc_map(mm, pmd, base + address);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
