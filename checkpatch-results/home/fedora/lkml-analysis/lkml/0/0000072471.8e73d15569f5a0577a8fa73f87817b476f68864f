WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoull is obsolete, use kstrtoull instead
#70: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:2249:
+	unsigned long long n = simple_strtoull(buf, &e, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
