Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#499: FILE: sound/oss/dev_table.c:48:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
