specified by the community.

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#37: FILE: lib/zlib_inflate/inftrees.c:199:
+  r.word.pad = r.base = 0;      /* ditto */

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
