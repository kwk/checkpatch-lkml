ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#74: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2739:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#78: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2742:
+		if (unlikely(prio != next->prio))
+		{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#83: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2747:
+		}
+		else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
