ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#180: FILE: fs/mpage.c:481:
+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'guarentee' may be misspelled - perhaps 'guarantee'?
#209: FILE: fs/mpage.c:510:
+ * and msync() need to guarentee that all the data which was dirty at the time
                        ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#222: FILE: fs/mpage.c:525:
+	int (*writepage)(struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!get_block"
#225: FILE: fs/mpage.c:528:
+	if (get_block == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#241: FILE: fs/mpage.c:574:
+				bio = mpage_writepage(bio, page, get_block,
+						&last_block_in_bio, &ret);
