CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#46: FILE: kernel/resource.c:277:
+int expand_resource(struct resource *res, unsigned long size,
+			   unsigned long align)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#70: FILE: kernel/resource.c:301:
+		struct resource *prev = res->parent->child;
+		while (prev->sibling != res)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
