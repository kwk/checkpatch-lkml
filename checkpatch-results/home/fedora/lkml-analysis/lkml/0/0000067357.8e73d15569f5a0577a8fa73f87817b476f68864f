CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ret"
#100: FILE: lib/radix-tree.c:93:
+	if (ret == NULL && !(gfp_mask & __GFP_WAIT)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#203: FILE: lib/radix-tree.c:299:
+		BUG_ON(tag_get(node, 0, offset));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
