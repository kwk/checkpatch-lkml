#30: 
When slave was not found we will not remove it immediately but wait until ->ttl attempts were done.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#81: FILE: drivers/w1/w1.c:724:
+			if (sl && !test_bit(W1_SLAVE_ACTIVE, (unsigned long *)&sl->flags) && !--sl->ttl) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#120: FILE: drivers/w1/w1_int.c:35:
+extern int w1_max_slave_ttl;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#127: FILE: drivers/w1/w1_int.c:41:
+struct w1_master * w1_alloc_dev(u32 id, int slave_count, int slave_ttl,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
