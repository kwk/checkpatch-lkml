+	  This option allow you to don't lock acpi devices that are used
+	  by pnpacpi. It could avoid locking some devices that shouldn't
+	  be locked, or allow to used acpi drivers instead of pnp drivers.
+	  Note that it will disable hotplug support for pnpacpi devices.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
