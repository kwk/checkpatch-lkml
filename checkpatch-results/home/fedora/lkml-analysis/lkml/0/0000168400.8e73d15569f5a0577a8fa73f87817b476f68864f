WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#139: FILE: drivers/base/power/sysfs.c:38:
+	state.event = simple_strtoul(buf, &rest, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#217: FILE: drivers/net/irda/vlsi_ir.c:1760:
+		if (state.event > pdev->current_state) {	/* simply go deeper */
[...]
 		else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 149 exceeds 100 columns
#223: FILE: drivers/net/irda/vlsi_ir.c:1765:
+			IRDA_ERROR("%s - %s: invalid suspend request %u -> %u\n", __FUNCTION__, PCIDEV_NAME(pdev), pdev->current_state, state.event);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
