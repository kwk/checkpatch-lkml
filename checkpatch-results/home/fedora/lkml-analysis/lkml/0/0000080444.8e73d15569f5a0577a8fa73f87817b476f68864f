ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#66: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.h:35:
(http://www.act-solutions.com/HomePro.htm) */

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#67: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.h:36:
+/* ACT Solutions HomePro ZWave interface 
+#define FTDI_ACTZWAVE_PID      0xF2D0

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#69: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.h:38:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
