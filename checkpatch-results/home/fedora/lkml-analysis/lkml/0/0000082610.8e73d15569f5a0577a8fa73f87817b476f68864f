CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#84: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1313:
+			(u64) restart->arg0;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#128: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1357:
+	restart->arg0 = (unsigned long) uaddr;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#130: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1359:
+	if (to) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#133: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1362:
+	} else

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#134: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1363:
+		restart->arg2 = restart->arg3 = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
