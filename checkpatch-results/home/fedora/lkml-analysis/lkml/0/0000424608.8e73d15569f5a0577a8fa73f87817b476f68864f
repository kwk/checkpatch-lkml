ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#34: 
--- a/fs/proc/generic.c	Sat Oct  5 18:45:53 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#44: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:172:
+	int error = inode_setattr(inode, iattr);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#54: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:182:
+static struct inode_operations proc_file_inode_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dp->proc_iops"
#73: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:415:
+		if (dp->proc_iops == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
