CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#158: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:104:
+extern void hrtimer_init(struct hrtimer *timer, clockid_t which_clock,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#206: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:498:
+void hrtimer_init(struct hrtimer *timer, clockid_t clock_id, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
