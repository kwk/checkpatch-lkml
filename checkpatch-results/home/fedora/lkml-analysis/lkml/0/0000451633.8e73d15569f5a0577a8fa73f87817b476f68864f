Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#96: FILE: drivers/base/driver.c:82:
+void driver_unregister(struct device_driver * drv)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#144: FILE: include/linux/device.h:110:
+extern void driver_unregister(struct device_driver * drv);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
