The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

+	if ((self == NULL) ||
+	    (self->lsap == NULL) ||
+	    (self->lsap->lap == NULL) ||
+	    (self->lsap->lap->irlap == NULL))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!self"
#83: FILE: include/net/irda/irttp.h:204:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!self->lsap"
#84: FILE: include/net/irda/irttp.h:205:
+	    (self->lsap == NULL) ||

#88: FILE: include/net/irda/irttp.h:209:

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
