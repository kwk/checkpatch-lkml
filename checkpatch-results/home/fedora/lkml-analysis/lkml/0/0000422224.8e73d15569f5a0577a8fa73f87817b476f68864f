Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#115: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1134:
+			volatile unsigned char dummy;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#116: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1135:
+			volatile unsigned char dummy;
+			__get_user(dummy, buf);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
