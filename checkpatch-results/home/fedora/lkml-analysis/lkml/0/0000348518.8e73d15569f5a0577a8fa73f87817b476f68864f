Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#81: FILE: usr/src/linux/kernel/suspend.c:260:
+/* With SUSPEND_CONSOLE defined, it suspend looks *really* cool, but
+   we probably do not take enough locks for switching consoles, etc,

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#89: FILE: usr/src/linux/kernel/suspend.c:268:
+static int orig_loglevel = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
