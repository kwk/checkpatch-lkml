#24: 
Converts the radio-cadet driver.  Once again I don't have the hardware for this.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#28: 
--- a/drivers/media/radio/radio-cadet.c	Tue Jan 14 05:58:38 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
