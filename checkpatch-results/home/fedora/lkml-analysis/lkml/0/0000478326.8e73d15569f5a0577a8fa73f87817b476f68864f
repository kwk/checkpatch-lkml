WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#540: FILE: div64.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#541: FILE: div64.h:2:
+ * include/linux/div64.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#548: FILE: div64.h:9:
+ * If you really *really* need this, and are prepared to be flamed by $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#559: FILE: div64.h:20:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"

+static inline int do_div(unsigned long long * n, unsigned long base)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'do_div', this function's name, in a string
#589: FILE: div64.h:50:
+				panic("do_div called with 64 bit arg and unsupported base\n", base);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
