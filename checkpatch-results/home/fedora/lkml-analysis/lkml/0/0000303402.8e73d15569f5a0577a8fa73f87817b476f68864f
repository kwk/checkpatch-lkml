WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#48: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/i386-stub.c:307:
+		if (kgdb_hex2long(&ptr, &addr)) {
 			linux_regs->eip = addr;
 		} 

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
