CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/keys/user-type.h:40:
+extern void user_revoke(struct key *key);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#137: FILE: security/keys/user_defined.c:163:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(user_revoke);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
