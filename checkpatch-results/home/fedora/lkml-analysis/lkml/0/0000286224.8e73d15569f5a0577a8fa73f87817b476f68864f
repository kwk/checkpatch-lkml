#25: 
Having an 8139 based device in my notebook, I often switch between it and wireless.  The problem is that the 8139too driver does not save/restore the pci configuration of the card if the device isn't running.  This simple patch moves the save/restore code so that the code runs regardless of whether or not the device is running.
