WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#56: FILE: top.c:1703:
+							    ("CPU%d: %3d%s%-d%% user, %3d%s%-d%% system,"

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#57: FILE: top.c:1704:
+							    ("CPU%d: %3d%s%-d%% user, %3d%s%-d%% system,"
+							     " %3d%s%-d%% nice, %3d%s%-d%% iowait, %3d%s%-d%% idle",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
