CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#150: FILE: include/linux/page-flags.h:160:
+extern void ___mod_page_state_offset(unsigned long offset, unsigned long delta);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#186: FILE: include/linux/page-flags.h:209:
+#define ___mod_page_state_zone(zone, member, delta)			\
+ do {									\
+	___mod_page_state_offset(state_zone_offset(zone, member), (delta)); \
+ } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
