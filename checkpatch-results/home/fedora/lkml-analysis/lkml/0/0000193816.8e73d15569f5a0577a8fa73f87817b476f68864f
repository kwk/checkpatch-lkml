ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#60: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:66:
+static inline struct scsi_request *scsi_request(struct request *req) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sgl"
#82: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:644:
+	if (sgl == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#187: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1163:
+			/* Unrecognised return, fall through */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#214: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1193:
+	 * routine will get to free the associated resources */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#220: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1199:
+		struct scsi_request *sreq = scsi_request(req);
+		scsi_release_buffers(cmd);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
