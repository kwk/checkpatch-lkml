Since there is no lock held yet we are still preemptable; and since

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 120 exceeds 100 columns

+		__get_cpu_var_locked(__icmp_socket, i)->sk->sk_prot->unhash(__get_cpu_var_locked(__icmp_socket, i)->sk);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
