CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#82: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:964:
 			if (sense_valid && req->sense) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#84: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:966:
+				BUG_ON(req->sense_len);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
