WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 174 exceeds 100 columns
#49: FILE: drivers/acpi/utilities/utglobal.c:361:
+	/* ACPI_EVENT_RTC           */  {ACPI_BITREG_RT_CLOCK_STATUS,       ACPI_BITREG_RT_CLOCK_ENABLE,	ACPI_BITMASK_RT_CLOCK_STATUS,	ACPI_BITMASK_RT_CLOCK_ENABLE},

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#57: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/proc.c:1:
+#include <linux/interrupt.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#65: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/proc.c:374:
+static u32 rtc_handler(void * context)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
