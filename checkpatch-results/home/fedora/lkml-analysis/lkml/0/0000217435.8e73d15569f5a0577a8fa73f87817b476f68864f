CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <pSeries_cpu_die>
#57: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pSeries_smp.c:109:
+void pSeries_cpu_die(unsigned int cpu)

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#91: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/smp.c:567:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
