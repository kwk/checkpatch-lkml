ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#41: 
--- a/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-piix4.c	Fri Aug 15 11:27:13 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

+	/* Some BIOS will set up the chipset incorrectly and leave a register
+	   in an undefined state (causing I2C to act very strangely). */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
