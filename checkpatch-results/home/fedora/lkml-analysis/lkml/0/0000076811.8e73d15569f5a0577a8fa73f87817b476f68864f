#39: 
Ultra33 drive list lookups anymore; remove the duplicate code from the latter

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#68: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c		Version 0.43	May 17, 2006

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#333: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1388:
+	rid = info->revision = hpt_revision(dev);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
