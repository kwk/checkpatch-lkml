WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 142 exceeds 100 columns
#111: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:1215:
+	printk (KERN_INFO "rq_status: %d, rq_dev: %u, flags: %lx, errors: %d\n",rq->rq_status,(unsigned int) rq->rq_dev,rq->flags,rq->errors);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
