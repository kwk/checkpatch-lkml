WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dm_suspend', this function's name, in a string
#111: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:1355:
+			DMWARN("bdget failed in dm_suspend");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
