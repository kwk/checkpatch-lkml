WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#162: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/systbls.S:44:
+	.word compat_sys_rt_sigtimedwait, sys32_rt_sigqueueinfo, sys32_rt_sigsuspend, sys_setresuid, sys_getresuid

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
