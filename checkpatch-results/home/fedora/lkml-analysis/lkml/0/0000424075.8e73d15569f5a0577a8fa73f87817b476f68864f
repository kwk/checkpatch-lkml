CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#69: FILE: fs/fat/inode.c:239:
+	opts->utf8 = opts->unicode_xlate = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#79: FILE: fs/fat/inode.c:386:
+			printk("FAT: posix option is obsolete, "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#80: FILE: fs/fat/inode.c:387:
+			printk("FAT: posix option is obsolete, "
+			       "not supported now\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
