WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#93: FILE: drivers/input/misc/rawdev.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#184: FILE: drivers/input/misc/rawdev.c:92:
+	if (!(rawdev = rawdev_locate(iminor(inode)))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*list)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct rawdev_list)...)
#194: FILE: drivers/input/misc/rawdev.c:102:
+	if (!(list = kmalloc(sizeof(struct rawdev_list), GFP_KERNEL))) {

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#298: FILE: drivers/input/misc/rawdev.c:206:
+static ssize_t rawdev_write(struct file *file, const char __user *buffer, size_t count, loff_t *ppos)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#352: FILE: drivers/input/misc/rawdev.c:260:
+struct file_operations rawdev_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
