CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!regs"
#93: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/process.c:352:
+	if (regs == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/nmi.h> instead of <asm/nmi.h>
#113: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/smp.c:31:
+#include <asm/nmi.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#131: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/smp.c:458:
+static int smp_nmi_callback(struct pt_regs * regs, int cpu)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever
possible.
