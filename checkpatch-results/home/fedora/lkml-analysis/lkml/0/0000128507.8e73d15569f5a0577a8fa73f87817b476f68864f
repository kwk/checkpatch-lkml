+valid_mmap_phys_addr_range (unsigned long phys_addr, unsigned long *size)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#94: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/efi.c:845:
+				*size = md->phys_addr + (md->num_pages << EFI_PAGE_SHIFT) - phys_addr;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#151: FILE: include/asm-ia64/io.h:92:
+extern int valid_mmap_phys_addr_range (unsigned long addr, size_t *count);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
