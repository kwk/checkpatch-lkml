CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#37: FILE: include/linux/fuse.h:64:
+#define FATTR_FH	(1 << 6)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#102: FILE: fs/fuse/dir.c:789:
+		struct fuse_file *ff = iattr->ia_file->private_data;
+		arg->valid |= FATTR_FH;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
