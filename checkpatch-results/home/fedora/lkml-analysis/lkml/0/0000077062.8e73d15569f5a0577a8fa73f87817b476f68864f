CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#103: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/traps.c:197:
+		if (i > 50) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#220: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/proto.h:78:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#220: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/proto.h:78:
+extern void show_trace(struct task_struct *, struct pt_regs *, unsigned long * rsp);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
