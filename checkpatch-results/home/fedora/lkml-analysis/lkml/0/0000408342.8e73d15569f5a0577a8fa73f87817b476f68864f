CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#112: FILE: include/linux/thread_info.h:18:
+extern long do_no_restart_syscall(unsigned long arg0, unsigned long arg1);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#149: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1027:
+	struct timespec *rmtp = (struct timespec *) arg1;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
