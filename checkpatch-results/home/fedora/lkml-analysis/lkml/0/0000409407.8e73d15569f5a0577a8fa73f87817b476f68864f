WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#124: FILE: arch/i386/Kconfig:812:
+config SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
+        bool "Software Suspend (EXPERIMENTAL)"
+        depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PM
+        ---help---
+          Enable the possibilty of suspendig machine. It doesn't need APM.
+          You may suspend your machine by 'swsusp' or 'shutdown -z <time>'
+          (patch for sysvinit needed).
+
+          It creates an image which is saved in your active swaps. By the next
+          booting the, pass 'resume=/path/to/your/swap/file' and kernel will
+          detect the saved image, restore the memory from
+          it and then it continues to run as before you've suspended.
+          If you don't want the previous state to continue use the 'noresume'
+          kernel option. However note that your partitions will be fsck'd and
+          you must re-mkswap your swap partitions/files.
+
+          Right now you may boot without resuming and then later resume but
+          in meantime you cannot use those swap partitions/files which were
+          involved in suspending. Also in this case there is a risk that buffers
+          on disk won't match with saved ones.
+
+          SMP is supported ``as-is''. There's a code for it but doesn't work.
+          There have been problems reported relating SCSI.
+
+          This option is about getting stable. However there is still some
+          absence of features.
+
+          For more information take a look at Documentation/swsusp.txt.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
