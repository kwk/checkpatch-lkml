ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#52: FILE: /include/linux/mman.h:29:
=20

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#57: FILE: /include/linux/mman.h:30:

+/*=20

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#59: FILE: /include/linux/mman.h:32:
+ * assert that only a single bit is on in 'bit'=20
+ */=20

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#62: FILE: /include/linux/mman.h:35:
+	BUG_ON(bit & (bit - 1));=20

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
