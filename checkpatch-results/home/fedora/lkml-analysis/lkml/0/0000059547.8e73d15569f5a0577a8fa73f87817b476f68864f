CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#61: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1008:
+extern void set_dma_reserve(unsigned long new_dma_reserve);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
