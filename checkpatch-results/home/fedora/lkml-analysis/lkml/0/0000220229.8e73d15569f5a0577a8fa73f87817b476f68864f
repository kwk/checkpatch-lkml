#32: 
http://ccrma-mail.stanford.edu/pipermail/planetccrma/2004-December/007341.html.    If the realtime LSM were merged, then this would be the last step to making low latency audio work well with the stock kernel.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#44: 
Signed-Off-By: Jack O'Quin <joq@joq.us>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#122: FILE: security/realtime.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'capabilites' may be misspelled - perhaps 'capabilities'?
#187: FILE: security/realtime.c:66:
+	 *  groups, we grant realtime capabilites.
 	                              ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#224: FILE: security/realtime.c:103:
+	if (register_security(&capability_ops)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
