The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file

+include/linux/version.h: $(srctree)/Makefile $(localversion-files)

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
