ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#114: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:71:
+ ^I^Ireturn -EFAULT;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#114: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:71:
+ ^I^Ireturn -EFAULT;$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#114: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:71:
+ ^I^Ireturn -EFAULT;$

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#139: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:303:
+		written = do_write_mem((void*)p, p, buf, wrote, ppos);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#162: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:324:
+				ssize_t unwritten;
+				unwritten = copy_from_user(kbuf, buf, len);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
