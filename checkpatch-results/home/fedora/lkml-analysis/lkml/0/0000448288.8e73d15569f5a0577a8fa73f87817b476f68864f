# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#45: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c	Wed Jul 10 10:06:50 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#180: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c:170:
+	if (!atomic_add_negative(sleepers, &sem->count)) {
+		wake_up_locked(&sem->wait);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#196: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:490:
+extern void FASTCALL(__wake_up_locked(wait_queue_head_t *q, unsigned int mode));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#204: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:508:
+#define	wake_up_locked(x)		__wake_up_locked((x), TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE | TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

+						   wait_queue_t * wait)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
