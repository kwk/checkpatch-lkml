ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#57: FILE: fs/buffer.c:121:
+int __wait_on_buffer_wq(struct buffer_head * bh, wait_queue_t *wait)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#75: FILE: fs/buffer.c:137:
+			if (!is_sync_wait(wait)) {
+				return -EIOCBRETRY;
+			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

#177: FILE: include/linux/buffer_head.h:165:
+int __wait_on_buffer_wq(struct buffer_head *, wait_queue_t *wait);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
