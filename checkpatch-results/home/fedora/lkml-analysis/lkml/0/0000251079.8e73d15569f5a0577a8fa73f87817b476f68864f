CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:680:
+	hwif->nsect = hwif->nleft = rq->nr_sectors;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#101: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:691:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ide_init_sg_cmd);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#399: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1515:
+extern void ide_init_sg_cmd(ide_drive_t *, struct request *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#399: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1515:
+extern void ide_init_sg_cmd(ide_drive_t *, struct request *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct request *' should also have an identifier name
#399: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1515:
+extern void ide_init_sg_cmd(ide_drive_t *, struct request *);
