o remove FIXME in set_parameters, should be handled by dvb-core state machine

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#64: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/frontends/mt352.c:60:
+	struct mt352_state* state = fe->demodulator_priv;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*state)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct mt352_state)...)
#267: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/frontends/mt352.c:539:
+	state = kmalloc(sizeof(struct mt352_state), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
