WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated
#44: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd.c:10:
+ * $Revision: 1.165 $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#52: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd.c:1743:
+        if (dasd_page_cache != NULL) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dasd_page_cache"
#52: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd.c:1743:
+        if (dasd_page_cache != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
