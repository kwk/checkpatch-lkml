#79: 
# sysctl -w kernel.unknown_nmi_panic=1

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#274: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:70:
+extern int proc_unknown_nmi_panic(ctl_table *, int, struct file *,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ctl_table *' should also have an identifier name
#274: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:70:
+extern int proc_unknown_nmi_panic(ctl_table *, int, struct file *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
