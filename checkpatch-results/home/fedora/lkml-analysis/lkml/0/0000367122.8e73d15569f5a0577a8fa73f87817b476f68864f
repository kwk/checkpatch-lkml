ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#59: FILE: ide-taskfile.c:655:
 	if (--rq->current_nr_sectors <= 0)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'NULL == DRIVER(drive)'
#62: FILE: ide-taskfile.c:657:
+		if ((NULL == DRIVER(drive)) || 
+		    (!DRIVER(drive)->end_request(drive, 1)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#62: FILE: ide-taskfile.c:657:
+		if ((NULL == DRIVER(drive)) || 

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.
