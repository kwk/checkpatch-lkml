WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'via_rhine_rx', this function's name, in a string
#104: FILE: drivers/net/via-rhine.c:1401:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: via_rhine_rx(), entry %d status %8.8x.\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

#115: FILE: drivers/net/via-rhine.c:1509:
+/* Clears the "tally counters" for CRC errors and missed frames(?).
+   It has been reported that some chips need a write of 0 to clear

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
