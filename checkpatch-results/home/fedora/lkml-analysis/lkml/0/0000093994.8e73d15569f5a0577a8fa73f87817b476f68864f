WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#52: FILE: drivers/md/Kconfig:130:
+config MD_RAID5_RESHAPE
+	bool "Support adding drives to a raid-5 array (experimental)"
+	depends on MD_RAID5 && EXPERIMENTAL
+	---help---
+	  A RAID-5 set can be expanded by adding extra drives. This
+	  requires "restriping" the array which means (almost) every
+	  block must be written to a different place.
+
+          This option allows such restriping to be done while the array
+	  is online.  However it is still EXPERIMENTAL code.  It should
+	  work, but please be sure that you have backups.
+
+	  You will need a version of mdadm newer than 2.3.1.   During the
+	  early stage of reshape there is a critical section where live data
+	  is being over-written.  A crash during this time needs extra care
+	  for recovery.  The newer mdadm takes a copy of the data in the
+	  critical section and will restore it, if necessary, after a crash.
+
+	  The mdadm usage is e.g.
+	       mdadm --grow /dev/md1 --raid-disks=6
+	  to grow '/dev/md1' to having 6 disks.
+
+	  Note: The array can only be expanded, not contracted.
+	  There should be enough spares already present to make the new
+	  array workable.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#192: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:2507:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#202: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:2517:
+			if (raid5_add_disk(mddev, rdev)) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
