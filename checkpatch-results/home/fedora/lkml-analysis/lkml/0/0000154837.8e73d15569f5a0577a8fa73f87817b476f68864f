WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#39: FILE: include/linux/rt_irq.h:33:
+	do { check_raw_flags(flags); if (!__raw_irqs_disabled_flags(flags)) { trace_irqs_on(); } \

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
