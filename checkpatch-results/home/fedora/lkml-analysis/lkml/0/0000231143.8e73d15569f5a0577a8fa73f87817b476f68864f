Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'throttle_vm_writeout', this function's name, in a string
#119: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:306:
+				printk(KERN_WARNING "throttle_vm_writeout: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#120: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:307:

+				       "bailing out after %lu jiffies "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
