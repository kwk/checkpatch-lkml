WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#73: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1394:
+static int ext3_direct_IO(int rw, struct inode * inode, struct kiobuf * iobuf, unsigned long blocknr, int blocksize)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#73: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1394:
+static int ext3_direct_IO(int rw, struct inode * inode, struct kiobuf * iobuf, unsigned long blocknr, int blocksize)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#85: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1406:
+	if (rw == WRITE) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#112: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1433:
+			loff_t end = offset + ret;
+			if (end > inode->i_size) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
