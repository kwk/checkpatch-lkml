distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#105: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:771:
+	printk("process %s (%d) tried to syscall from an executable segment!\n", task->comm, task->pid);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
