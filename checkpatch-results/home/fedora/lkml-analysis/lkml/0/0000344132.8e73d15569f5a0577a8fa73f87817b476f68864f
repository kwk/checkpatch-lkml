CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#51: FILE: fs/ext3/namei.c:1308:
+	de = (struct ext3_dir_entry_2 *) ((char *)de + de->rec_len);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#59: FILE: fs/ext3/namei.c:2010:
+	inode->i_ctime = dir->i_ctime = dir->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
