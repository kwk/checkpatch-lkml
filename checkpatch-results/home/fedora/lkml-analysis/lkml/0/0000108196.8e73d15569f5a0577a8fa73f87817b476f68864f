WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#24: 
Ifdef'd the ACPI related parts in the ES7000 platform code. They were causing compile errors in certain configuration (without ACPI defined).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#130: FILE: arch/i386/mach-es7000/es7000.h:103:
+extern int find_unisys_acpi_oem_table(unsigned long *oem_addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
