WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'xprt_cwnd_limited', this function's name, in a string
#125: FILE: net/sunrpc/xprt.c:325:
+	dprintk("RPC: %4d xprt_cwnd_limited cong = %ld cwnd = %ld\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#168: FILE: net/sunrpc/xprt.c:355:
+		 * the result gets rounded properly. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:NETWORKING_BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: networking block comments don't use an empty /* line, use /* Comment...
#186: FILE: net/sunrpc/xprt.c:370:
+/*
+ * Adjust the congestion window, and wake up the next task

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#200: FILE: net/sunrpc/xprt.c:384:
+		struct rpc_task *next = xprt->snd_task;
+		if (next && !next->tk_rqstp->rq_cong)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
