WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#49: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:27:
+extern int swsusp_shrink_memory(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#91: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:106:
+	if (!(error = swsusp_shrink_memory()))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
