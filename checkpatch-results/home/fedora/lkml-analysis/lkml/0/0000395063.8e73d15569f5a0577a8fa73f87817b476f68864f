CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!x->ealg"
#54: FILE: esp.c:598:
+	if (x->ealg == NULL || (x->ealg->alg_key_len == 0 && x->props.ealgo != SADB_EALG_NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
