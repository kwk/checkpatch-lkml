WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#84: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2188:
+		BUG_ON(ret);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#107: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:39:
+		int ret = 0;
+		ret = init_currently_empty_zone(zone, phys_start_pfn, nr_pages);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#138: FILE: include/linux/mmzone.h:335:
+extern int init_currently_empty_zone(struct zone *zone, unsigned long start_pfn,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
