ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#116: FILE: drivers/scsi/iteraid.c:305:
+static int ite_major = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#124: FILE: drivers/scsi/iteraid.c:307:
+static struct file_operations itedev_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
