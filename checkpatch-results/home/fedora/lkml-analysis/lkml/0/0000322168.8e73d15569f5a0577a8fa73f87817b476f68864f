CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!co"
#122: FILE: linux-2.4.22-bm1/drivers/char/console.c:2184:
+	if (co == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#150: FILE: linux-2.4.22-bm1/drivers/char/console.c:2455:
+	if (vc_cons[currcons].d) return;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
