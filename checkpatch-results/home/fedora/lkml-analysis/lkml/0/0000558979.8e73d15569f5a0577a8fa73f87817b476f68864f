WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#45: FILE: Makefile:222:
+# arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile is the last thing that is allowed to change CROSS_COMPILE.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
