The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#94: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-av.c:216:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#231: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-av.c:749:
+	switch (saa->pci->subsystem_device) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
