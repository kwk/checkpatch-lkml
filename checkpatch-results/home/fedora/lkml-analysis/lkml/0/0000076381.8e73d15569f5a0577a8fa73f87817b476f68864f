CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#166: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:211:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#229: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:269:
+		BUG_ON(ret);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#260: FILE: include/linux/node.h:33:
+extern int register_one_node(int nid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
