#30: 
This patch fixes the UP boot problem in 2.6.0test3-bk7 for me. I just ported over

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Dprintk>
#121: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/smpboot.c:806:
+	Dprintk("CPU present map: %lx\n", physids_coerce(phys_cpu_present_map));

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
