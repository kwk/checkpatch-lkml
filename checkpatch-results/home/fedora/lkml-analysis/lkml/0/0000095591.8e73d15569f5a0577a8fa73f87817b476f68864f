WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#50: 
Signed-Off-By: Mark Brown <broonie@sirena.org.uk>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#83: FILE: drivers/net/natsemi.c:901:
+	if (option & 0x400) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#109: FILE: drivers/net/natsemi.c:927:
+		 * find one. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
