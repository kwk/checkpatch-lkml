Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#121: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:46:
+	pci_assign_all_busses = simple_strtol(str,NULL,0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
