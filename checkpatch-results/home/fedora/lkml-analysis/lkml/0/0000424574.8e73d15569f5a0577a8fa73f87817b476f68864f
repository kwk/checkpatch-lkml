# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name

#74: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer.c:29:

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
