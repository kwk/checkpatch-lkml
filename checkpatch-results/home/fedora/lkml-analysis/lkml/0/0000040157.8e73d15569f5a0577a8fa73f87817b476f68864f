Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#116: FILE: fs/nfs/direct.c:327:
+		BUG_ON(pgbase != (user_addr & ~PAGE_MASK));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
