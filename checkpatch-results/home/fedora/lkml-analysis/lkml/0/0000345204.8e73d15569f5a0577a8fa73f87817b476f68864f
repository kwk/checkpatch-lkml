This is a probable solution to [BUG #568] -  compile failure in drivers/isdn/hisax/diva.c

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#77: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/diva.c:754:
+						if (diva_ipac_isa_probe(card->cs, card))

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
