ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#91: FILE: sound/oss/mad16.c:892:
+static int __initdata joystick = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after joystick
#91: FILE: sound/oss/mad16.c:892:
+static int __initdata joystick = 0;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#136: FILE: sound/oss/mad16.c:1046:
+		if (!request_region(0x201, 1, "mad16 gameport"))
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
