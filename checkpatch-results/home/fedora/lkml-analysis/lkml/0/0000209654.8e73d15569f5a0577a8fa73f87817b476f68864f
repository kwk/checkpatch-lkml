ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#71: 
--- a/include/linux/sched.h	2005-02-02 22:15:51.000000000 +0100

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#88: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2692:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
