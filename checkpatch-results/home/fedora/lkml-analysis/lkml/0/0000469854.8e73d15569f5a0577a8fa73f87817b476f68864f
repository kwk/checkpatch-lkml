CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#113: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs.h:277:
+extern u32 root_nfs_parse_addr(char *name); /*__init*/

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#136: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:1118:
+	cp = cq = name;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#148: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:1130:
+	if (octets == 4 && (*cp == ':' || *cp == '\0')) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
