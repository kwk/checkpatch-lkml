WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#95: FILE: include/linux/preempt.h:18:
+#define inc_preempt_count()	do { preempt_count()++; } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#143: FILE: init/Kconfig:282:
+config PREEMPT_TIMING
+	bool "Non-preemptible critical section timing"
+	default n
+	help
+	  This option measures the time spent in non-preemptible critical
+	  sections and reports warnings when a boot-time configurable
+	  latency threshold is exceeded.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
