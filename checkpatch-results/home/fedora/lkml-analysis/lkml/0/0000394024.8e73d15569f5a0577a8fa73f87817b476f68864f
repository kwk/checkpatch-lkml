Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#48: FILE: net/ipv4/fib_hash.c:944:
+			if (iter->zone->fz_next);
 				break;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#48: FILE: net/ipv4/fib_hash.c:944:
+			if (iter->zone->fz_next);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
