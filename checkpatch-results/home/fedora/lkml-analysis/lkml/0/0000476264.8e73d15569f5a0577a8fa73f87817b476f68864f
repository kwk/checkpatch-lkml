Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
