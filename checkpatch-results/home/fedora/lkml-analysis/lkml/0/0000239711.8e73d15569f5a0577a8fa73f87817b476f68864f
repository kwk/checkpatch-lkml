Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#127: FILE: mm/memory.c:610:
+						/* fail if this is a duplicate physical page in this kiovec */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#129: FILE: mm/memory.c:612:
+						int i2 = i;
+						while (i2--)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#129: FILE: mm/memory.c:612:
+						while (i2--)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
