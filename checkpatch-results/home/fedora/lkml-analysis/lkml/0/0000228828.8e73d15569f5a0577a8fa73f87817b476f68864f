CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#57: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/ti113x.h:598:
+	val_orig = val = config_readl(socket, TI113X_SYSTEM_CONTROL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#59: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/ti113x.h:600:
