ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#569: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:690:
+	if (!(psmouse = kmalloc(sizeof(struct psmouse), GFP_KERNEL))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*psmouse)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct psmouse)...)
#569: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:690:
+	if (!(psmouse = kmalloc(sizeof(struct psmouse), GFP_KERNEL))) {

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct serio *' should also have an identifier name
#829: FILE: include/linux/serio.h:70:
+	int  (*connect)(struct serio *, struct serio_driver *drv);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
