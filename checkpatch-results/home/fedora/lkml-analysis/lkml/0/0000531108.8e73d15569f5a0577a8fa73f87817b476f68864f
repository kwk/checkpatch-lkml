WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#46: FILE: drivers/sound/cmpci.c:1298:
+	[SOUND_MIXER_PCM]    = { DSP_MIX_VOICEVOLIDX_L,  DSP_MIX_VOICEVOLIDX_R,  MT_5MUTE,     0x00, 0x00 },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
