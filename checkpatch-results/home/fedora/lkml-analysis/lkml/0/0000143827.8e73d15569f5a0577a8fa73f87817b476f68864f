Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern int expand_stack(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long address);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
