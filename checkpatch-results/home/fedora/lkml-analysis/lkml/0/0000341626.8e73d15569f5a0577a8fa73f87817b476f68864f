ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

iicx */

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#49: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c:118:
+	{"HP", "A6189B", "*", BLIST_SPARSELUN | BLIST_LARGELUN},/* HP Va7110
+	{"HP", "A6218A", "*", BLIST_SPARSELUN | BLIST_LARGELUN},/* HP Va7410

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
