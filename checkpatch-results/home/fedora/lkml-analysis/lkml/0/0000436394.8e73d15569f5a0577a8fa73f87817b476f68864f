WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxV)
#37: FILE: sound/oss/midibuf.c:58:
+static spinlock_t lock=SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#81: FILE: sound/oss/midibuf.c:138:
+					spin_unlock_irqrestore(&lock,flags);/* Give some time to others */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
#81: FILE: sound/oss/midibuf.c:138:

 					                            ^

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#145: FILE: sound/oss/midibuf.c:302:
+^I^I^I/* yes, think the same, so I removed the cli() brackets $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#146: FILE: sound/oss/midibuf.c:303:
+			/* yes, think the same, so I removed the cli() brackets 
+				QUEUE_BYTE is protected against interrupts */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
