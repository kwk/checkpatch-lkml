#27: 
[PATCH] dmapool: use dev_err() whenever we can to get the better information in it.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/drivers/base/dmapool.c	Mon Feb  9 14:59:26 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
