#33: 
user.h is too generic a header name. I've split out allocation routines from it.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#180: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#193: FILE: arch/um/include/um_malloc.h:9:
+extern void *um_kmalloc(int size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
