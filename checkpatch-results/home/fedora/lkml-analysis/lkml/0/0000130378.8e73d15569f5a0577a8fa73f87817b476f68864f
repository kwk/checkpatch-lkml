CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#73: FILE: include/linux/ptimer.h:40:
+extern void ptimer_set_base(struct ptimer *timer, int base);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#385: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:785:
+	if (!(flags & TIMER_ABSTIME)) {
[...]
+	} else if (which_clock == CLOCK_REALTIME)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#642: FILE: kernel/ptimer.c:58:
+	BUG_ON(ptimer_active(timer));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
