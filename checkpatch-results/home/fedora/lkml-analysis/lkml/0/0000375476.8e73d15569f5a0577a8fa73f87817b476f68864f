WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#92: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:86:
+extern int skip_apic_ids[NR_CPUS];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#94: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:88:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
