CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#152: FILE: fs/eventpoll.c:738:
+		if (error == -EINTR) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#154: FILE: fs/eventpoll.c:740:
+^I^I^Iset_thread_flag(TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK); $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#155: FILE: fs/eventpoll.c:741:
+		} else

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#164: FILE: fs/eventpoll.c:750:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
