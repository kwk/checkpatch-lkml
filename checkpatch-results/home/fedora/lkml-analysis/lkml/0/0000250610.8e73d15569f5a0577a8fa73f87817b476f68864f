WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#183: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-dma.c:660:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ide_dma_start);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#318: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/sgiioc4.c:195:
+static void sgiioc4_ide_dma_start(ide_drive_t * drive)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#459: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:878:
+	void (*dma_start)(ide_drive_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#468: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1519:
+extern void ide_dma_start(ide_drive_t *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
