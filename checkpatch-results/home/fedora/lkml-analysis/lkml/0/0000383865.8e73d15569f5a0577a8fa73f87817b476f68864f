WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#23: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:2:
+ *  linux/drivers/ide/ide-disk.c	Version 1.18	Mar 05, 2003

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#107: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:936:
+	if (drive == NULL || (rq = HWGROUP(drive)->rq) == NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!drive"
#107: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:936:
+	if (drive == NULL || (rq = HWGROUP(drive)->rq) == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
