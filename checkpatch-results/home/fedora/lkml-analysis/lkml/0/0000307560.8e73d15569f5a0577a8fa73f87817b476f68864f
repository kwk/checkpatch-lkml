CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!group_info"
#112: FILE: fs/nfsd/auth.c:32:
+	if (group_info == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cred->cr_uid'
#141: FILE: fs/nfsd/auth.c:67:
+		if ((cred->cr_uid)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct svc_rqst *' should also have an identifier name
#163: FILE: include/linux/nfsd/auth.h:24:
+int nfsd_setuser(struct svc_rqst *, struct svc_export *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct svc_export *' should also have an identifier name
#163: FILE: include/linux/nfsd/auth.h:24:
+int nfsd_setuser(struct svc_rqst *, struct svc_export *);
