WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#64: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/kprobes.c:269:
+	extern char __start_ivt_text[], __end_ivt_text[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+	return (addr >= (unsigned long)__start_ivt_text

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

spaces are never used for indentation.
