WARNING:LIKELY_MISUSE: nested (un)?likely() calls, IS_ERR already uses unlikely() internally
#126: FILE: fs/ntfs/mft.c:159:
+	if (likely(!IS_ERR(m)))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#146: FILE: fs/ntfs/mft.h:32:
+extern MFT_RECORD *try_map_mft_record(ntfs_inode *ni);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
