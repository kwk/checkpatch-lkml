ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#47: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:626:
+extern void prefetch_switch_stack(struct task_struct*);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:626:
+extern void prefetch_switch_stack(struct task_struct*);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
