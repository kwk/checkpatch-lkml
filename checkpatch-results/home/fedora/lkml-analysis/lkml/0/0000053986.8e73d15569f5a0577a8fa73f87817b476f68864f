#88: FILE: sound/core/pcm_native.c:3223:
+	snd_assert(substream != NULL, ret_ENXIO; return -ENXIO);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
