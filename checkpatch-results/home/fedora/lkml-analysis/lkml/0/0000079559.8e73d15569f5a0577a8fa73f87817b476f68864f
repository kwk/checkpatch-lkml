WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'yeild' may be misspelled - perhaps 'yield'?
#101: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:136:
+		 * this should yeild cpus already notified successfully
 		               ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#108: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:143:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:YIELD: Using yield() is generally wrong. See yield() kernel-doc (sched/core.c)
#119: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:154:
+			yield();

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#126: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:161:
+	int cpu;
+	for_each_cpu_mask(cpu, mask)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#249: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:267:
