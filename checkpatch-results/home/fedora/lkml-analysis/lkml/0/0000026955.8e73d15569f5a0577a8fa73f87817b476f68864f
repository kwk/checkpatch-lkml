ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#108: FILE: drivers/pci/access.c:99:
+	if (unlikely(dev->block_ucfg_access)) pci_wait_ucfg(dev);	\

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#182: FILE: drivers/pci/access.c:163:
+	 * block, which we don't support. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#211: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:637:
+extern int __must_check pci_block_user_cfg_access(struct pci_dev *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
