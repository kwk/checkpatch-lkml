#ifdef CONFIG_PCMCIA

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#165: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:784:
+extern void cardbus_register(pci_socket_t *socket);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#209: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:835:
+				int ret = d->op->open(socket);
+				if (ret < 0) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
