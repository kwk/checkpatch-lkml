CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#207: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:458:
+	extern void sighand_free_cb(struct rcu_head *rhp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#268: FILE: kernel/signal.c:340:
+	if (tsk->sighand != NULL) {
+		__exit_sighand(tsk);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "tsk->sighand"
#268: FILE: kernel/signal.c:340:
+	if (tsk->sighand != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#301: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1164:
+	if (!ret && sig && (sp = p->sighand)) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
