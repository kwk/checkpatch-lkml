WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#78: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:337:
+	size_t count = req->num_pages << PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
+	req->out.page_zeroing = 1;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#92: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:361:
+		data->req = req = fuse_get_request(fc);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
