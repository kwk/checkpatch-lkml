ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#79: 
--- a/Documentation/i2c/porting-clients	Fri May 14 16:19:05 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#449: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:289:
+#define I2C_CLASS_HWMON		(1<<0)	/* lm_sensors, ... */
                        		  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#449: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:289:
+#define I2C_CLASS_HWMON		(1<<0)	/* lm_sensors, ... */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
