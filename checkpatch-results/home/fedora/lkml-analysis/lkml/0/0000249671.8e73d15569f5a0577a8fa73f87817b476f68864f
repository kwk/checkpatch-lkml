CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#61: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:34:
+extern void mark_free_pages(struct zone *zone);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#191: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:460:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
