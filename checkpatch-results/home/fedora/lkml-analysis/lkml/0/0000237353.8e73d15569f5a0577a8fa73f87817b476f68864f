ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#65: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:137:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;

  case 'M':
  case 'm':

  case 'K':
  case 'k':

  default:

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#71: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:142:
+				if (value) { value = (value < 0 ? -1 : 1); }

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#71: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:142:
+				if (value) { value = (value < 0 ? -1 : 1); }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
