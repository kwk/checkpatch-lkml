ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#67: FILE: sound/pci/cs46xx/cs46xx_lib.c:3578:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#69: FILE: sound/pci/cs46xx/cs46xx_lib.c:3580:
+	pdev = pci_get_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL,
+		PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82371AB_3, NULL);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pdev"
#70: FILE: sound/pci/cs46xx/cs46xx_lib.c:3581:
+	if (pdev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
