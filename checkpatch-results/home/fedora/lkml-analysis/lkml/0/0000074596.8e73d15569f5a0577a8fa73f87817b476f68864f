The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#188: FILE: include/asm-arm/arch-ixp4xx/udc.h:17:
+extern void pxa_set_udc_info(struct pxa2xx_udc_mach_info *info);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
