## add a module param own_irq=1 to forbid interrupt sharing

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#139: FILE: drivers/net/e100/e100_main.c:427:
+int own_irq = 0; /* every card gets *own* IRQ? */

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#150: FILE: drivers/net/e100/e100_main.c:1159:
+	if ((rc = request_irq(dev->irq, &e100intr, own_irq ? 0 : SA_SHIRQ,

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#162: FILE: drivers/net/e100/e100_main.c:2070:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'e100intr', this function's name, in a string
#165: FILE: drivers/net/e100/e100_main.c:2073:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "e100intr ignoring disabled interrupt, suspect irq-sharing\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'intr_status == 0xffff'
#172: FILE: drivers/net/e100/e100_main.c:2080:
+	if (!(intr_status & SCB_STATUS_ACK_MASK) || (intr_status == 0xffff))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
