ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#131: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/mce.c:395:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#305: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:304:
+extern void synchronize_kernel_barrier(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#361: FILE: kernel/rcupdate.c:571:
+	if (sched_getaffinity(0, &oldmask) < 0) {
+		oldmask = cpu_possible_mask;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
