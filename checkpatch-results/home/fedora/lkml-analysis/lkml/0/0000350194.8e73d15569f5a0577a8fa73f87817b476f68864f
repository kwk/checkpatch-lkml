Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#71: FILE: Makefile:510:
+include/linux/version.h: Makefile patchdesc.*

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
