CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*q)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct hash)...)
#860: FILE: init/initramfs.c:44:
+	q = kmalloc(sizeof(struct hash), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
