WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#53: FILE: drivers/usb/mon/mon_dma.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#55: FILE: drivers/usb/mon/mon_dma.c:3:
+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ARCH_DEFINES: architecture specific defines should be avoided
#68: FILE: drivers/usb/mon/mon_dma.c:16:
+#ifdef __i386__		/* CONFIG_ARCH_I386 does not exit */

Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever
possible.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#94: FILE: drivers/usb/mon/mon_dma.c:42:
+	ptr = map + (dma_addr & (PAGE_SIZE-1));
 	                                  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!urb->transfer_buffer"
#157: FILE: drivers/usb/mon/mon_text.c:127:
+	if (urb->transfer_buffer == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#172: FILE: drivers/usb/mon/usb_mon.h:50:
+extern char mon_dmapeek(unsigned char *dst, dma_addr_t dma_addr, int len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
