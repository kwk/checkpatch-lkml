CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#60: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:71:
+#define ALWAYS_SOFTIRQ		(1 << RUN_TIMER_LIST)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#69: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:84:
+extern void timer_softirq(struct softirq_action* a);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:84:
+extern void timer_softirq(struct softirq_action* a);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
