WARNING:DUPLICATED_SYSCTL_CONST: duplicated sysctl range checking value 'zero', consider using the shared one in include/linux/sysctl.h
#108: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:870:
+		.extra1		= &zero,

Commit d91bff3011cf ("proc/sysctl: add shared variables for range
check") added some shared const variables to be used instead of a local
copy in each source file.

Consider replacing the sysctl range checking value with the shared
one in include/linux/sysctl.h.  The following conversion scheme may
be used::

  &zero     ->  SYSCTL_ZERO
  &one      ->  SYSCTL_ONE
  &int_max  ->  SYSCTL_INT_MAX

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'sytem' may be misspelled - perhaps 'system'?
#121: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:56:
+/* Is the sytem in an emergency situation? */
           ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#122: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:57:
+int system_in_emergency = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
