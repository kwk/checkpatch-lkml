WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#107: FILE: usr/src/linux/fs/attr.c:188:
+		if (dn_mask) {
 			dnotify_parent(dentry, dn_mask);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 176 exceeds 100 columns

+		/* Nonotify: Initially set dcontents_mtime to the current time. Why? When the inode object gets lost and reallocated, "clients" should reread the directory.  */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'type == READ'
#167: FILE: usr/src/linux/fs/read_write.c:477:
+	if ((ret + (type == READ)) > 0) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#170: FILE: usr/src/linux/fs/read_write.c:480:
+		if (DN_MODIFY) nonotify_parent(file->f_dentry);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
