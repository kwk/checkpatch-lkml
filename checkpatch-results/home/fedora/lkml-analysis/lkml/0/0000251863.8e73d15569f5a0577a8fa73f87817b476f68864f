CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#82: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:679:
+	hwif->nsect = hwif->nleft = rq->nr_sectors;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#83: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:680:
+	hwif->cursg = hwif->cursg_ofs = 0;

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#93: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:690:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ide_init_sg_cmd);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#391: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1555:
+extern void ide_init_sg_cmd(ide_drive_t *, struct request *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
