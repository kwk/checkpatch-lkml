ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#47: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:509:
+	static struct pci_dev *pci_dev_i = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#55: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:571:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#55: FILE: drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c:571:
 	for ( i = 0; i < IP2_MAX_BOARDS; ++i ) {
+		

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
