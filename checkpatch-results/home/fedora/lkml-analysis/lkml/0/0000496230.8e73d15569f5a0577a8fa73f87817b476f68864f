ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#63: FILE: include/linux/time.h:61:
+timespec_less(struct timespec a, struct timespec b, struct timespec * result)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#65: FILE: include/linux/time.h:63:
+	if (a.tv_nsec < b.tv_nsec)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#134: FILE: kernel/timer.c:839:
+				t.tv_nsec = t.tv_sec = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
