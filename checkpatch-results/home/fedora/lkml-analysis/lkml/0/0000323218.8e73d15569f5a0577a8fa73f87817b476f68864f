Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#36: 
Hm, maybe for 2.4.23 it is sane but then reapply it again + merge ide-core and ide-detect

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#56: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1419:
+static int ideprobe_done = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#89: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe-mini.c:2:
+ *  linux/drivers/ide/ide-probe-mini.c	Version 1

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
