ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#75: FILE: sound/oss/opl3sa2.c:1135:
+	        if (opl3sa2_state[card].cfg_mpu.slots[1] != -1) {
 			unload_opl3sa2_mpu(&opl3sa2_state[card].cfg_mpu);
  		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
