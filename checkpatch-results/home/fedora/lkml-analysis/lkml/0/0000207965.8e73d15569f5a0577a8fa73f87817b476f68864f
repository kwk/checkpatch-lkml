> > > kernel when you removed any of these class devices?  Why did you ignore

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#104: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:365:
+	struct tpm_chip *chip = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
+	if (chip == NULL)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!chip"
#104: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:365:
+	if (chip == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'show_pcrs' to 'pcrs_show'
#143: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:622:
+	DEVICE_ATTR(pcrs, S_IRUGO, show_pcrs, NULL);

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#143: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:622:
+	DEVICE_ATTR(pcrs, S_IRUGO, show_pcrs, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_PERMS: DEVICE_ATTR unusual permissions 'S_IWUSR | S_IWGRP' used
#146: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:625:
+	DEVICE_ATTR(cancel, S_IWUSR | S_IWGRP, NULL, store_cancel);

The permissions used in DEVICE_ATTR are unusual.
Typically only three permissions are used - 0644 (RW), 0444 (RO)
and 0200 (WO).
