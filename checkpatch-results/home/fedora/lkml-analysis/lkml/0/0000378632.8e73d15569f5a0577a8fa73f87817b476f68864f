ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#48: FILE: fs/nfs/dir.c:717:
+	void * kaddr;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#57: FILE: fs/nfs/dir.c:740:
+			kaddr = desc.ptr = kmap_atomic(page, KM_USER0);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
