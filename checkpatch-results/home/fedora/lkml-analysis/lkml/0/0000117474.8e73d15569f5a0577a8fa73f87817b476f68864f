 So, I would like to post them step by step like followings.
                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

IIRC, SRAT is just for booting time. So, when hotplug occured,

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'acpi_memory_match_paddr_to_memdevice', this function's name, in a string
#140: FILE: drivers/acpi/acpi_memhotplug.c:564:
+	ACPI_FUNCTION_TRACE("acpi_memory_match_paddr_to_memdevice\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#150: FILE: drivers/acpi/acpi_memhotplug.c:574:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

#180: FILE: drivers/acpi/acpi_memhotplug.c:604:

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
