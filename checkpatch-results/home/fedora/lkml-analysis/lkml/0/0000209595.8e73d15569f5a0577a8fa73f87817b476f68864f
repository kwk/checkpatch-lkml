#39: 
I updated the structures and functions to use struct device and related functions

pci_dev everytime.  Also pci calls to get and set driver data were merely 
        ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'tpm_atml_send', this function's name, in a string
#106: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_atmel.c:98:
+	dev_dbg(chip->dev, "tpm_atml_send: ");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#127: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_atmel.c:169:
+	if ((rc = tpm_register_hardware(&pci_dev->dev, &tpm_atmel)) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#382: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.h:84:
+extern int tpm_register_hardware(struct device *,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct device *' should also have an identifier name
#382: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.h:84:
+extern int tpm_register_hardware(struct device *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct tpm_vendor_specific *' should also have an identifier name
