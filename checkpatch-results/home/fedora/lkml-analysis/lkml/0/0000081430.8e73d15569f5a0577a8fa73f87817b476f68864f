       ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#58: FILE: include/asm-i386/i387.h:67:
+   ^I   values. safe_address is a random variable that should be in L1 */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#58: FILE: include/asm-i386/i387.h:67:
+   ^I   values. safe_address is a random variable that should be in L1 */$

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#58: FILE: include/asm-i386/i387.h:67:
+   	   values. safe_address is a random variable that should be in L1 */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
