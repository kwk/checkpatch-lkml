ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#46: FILE: net/appletalk/aarp.c:43:
+unsigned char const atalk_eth_multicast[ETH_ALEN] =
+			{ 0x09, 0x00, 0x07, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#112: FILE: net/appletalk/ddp.c:74:
+extern unsigned char atalk_eth_multicast[ETH_ALEN];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
