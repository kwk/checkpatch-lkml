Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#285: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/analog.c:590:
+static int analog_init_port(struct gameport *gameport, struct gameport_driver *drv, struct analog_port *port)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct gameport *' should also have an identifier name
#782: FILE: include/linux/gameport.h:48:
+	void (*connect)(struct gameport *, struct gameport_driver *drv);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
