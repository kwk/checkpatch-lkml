#17: 
Standard 8250/16550 UART support is broken in 2.5.40, and I needed it, so following a bit of advice from Russell King, I've prepared this patch.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'incase' may be misspelled - perhaps 'in case'?
#19: 
I thought I'd post it, just incase anybody else out there actually uses serial ports, (seems they don't).  Before you apply it, bear in mind that the last C I did was a hello world program :-), (only half kidding).
