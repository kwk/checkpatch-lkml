Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#65: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1588:
+	BUG_ON(zone_type > ZONE_EASY_RECLAIM);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#108: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:84:
+	int zone = fls(GFP_ZONEMASK & (__force int) gfp);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
