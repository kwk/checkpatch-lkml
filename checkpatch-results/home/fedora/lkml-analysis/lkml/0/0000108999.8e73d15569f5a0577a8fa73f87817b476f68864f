#73: FILE: mm/slab.c:3680:
+		unsigned long sym = (unsigned long) *dbg_userword(cache, obj);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#75: FILE: mm/slab.c:3682:

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#98: FILE: mm/slab.c:3705:
+			struct slab *slab = list_entry(q, struct slab, list);
+			print_slab_last_users(cache, slab);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
