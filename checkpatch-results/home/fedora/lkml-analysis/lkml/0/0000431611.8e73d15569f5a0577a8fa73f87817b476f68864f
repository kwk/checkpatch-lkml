ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#30: 
--- a/arch/alpha/kernel/entry.S	Tue Sep 17 20:29:37 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

+        : "Ir" (flags), "I" (CLONE_VM | CLONE_UNTRACED), "r" (fn), "r" (arg)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

+        : "Ir" (flags), "I" (CLONE_VM | CLONE_UNTRACED), "r" (fn), "r" (arg)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements

+        : "Ir" (flags), "I" (CLONE_VM | CLONE_UNTRACED), "r" (fn), "r" (arg)

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
