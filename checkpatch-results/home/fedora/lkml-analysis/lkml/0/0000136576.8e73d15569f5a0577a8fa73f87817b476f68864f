ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#49: 
--- a/ChangeLog	2005-03-19 00:49:52 +01:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#102: FILE: ip/ipaddress.c:844:
+		if (cmd == RTM_DELADDR && lcl.family == AF_INET && !(lcl.flags & PREFIXLEN_SPECIFIED)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#104: FILE: ip/ipaddress.c:846:
+			    "Warning: Executing wildcard deletion to stay compatible with old scripts.\n" \

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
