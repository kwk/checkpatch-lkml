CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*p_ca_message)...) over kmalloc(sizeof (struct ca_msg)...)
#76: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/bt8xx/dst_ca.c:476:
+	p_ca_message = kmalloc(sizeof (struct ca_msg), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
