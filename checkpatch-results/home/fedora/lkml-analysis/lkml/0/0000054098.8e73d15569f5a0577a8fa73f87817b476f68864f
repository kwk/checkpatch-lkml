CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#44: FILE: fs/ext3/super.c:557:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!inode"
#67: FILE: fs/ext3/super.c:580:
+	if (inode == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#70: FILE: fs/ext3/super.c:583:
+	if (is_bad_inode(inode)
+	    || (generation && inode->i_generation != generation)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#72: FILE: fs/ext3/super.c:585:
+		iput(inode);
 		^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
