CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#42: FILE: arch/um/include/kern_util.h:32:
+extern int do_signal(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#55: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process_kern.c:144:
+	if(test_tsk_thread_flag(current, TIF_SIGPENDING)) do_signal();

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#55: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process_kern.c:144:
+	if(test_tsk_thread_flag(current, TIF_SIGPENDING)) do_signal();

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#71: FILE: arch/um/kernel/signal_kern.c:164:
+^Ireturn(kern_do_signal(&current->thread.regs, NULL, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
