WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'awefully' may be misspelled - perhaps 'awfully'?
#75: 
It's awefully risky. At least a comment is in order.
     ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'doens't' may be misspelled - perhaps 'doesn't'?
#100:

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#281: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.h:52:
+#define UART_BUG_NOMSR	(1 << 2)	/* UART has buggy MSR status bits (Au1x00) */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
