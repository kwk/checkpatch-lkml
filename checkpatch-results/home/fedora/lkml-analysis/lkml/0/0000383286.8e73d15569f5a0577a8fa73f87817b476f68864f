WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#82: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2135:
+		struct file_operations *fops = cdev->cd_fops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#83: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2136:
+		struct file_operations *fops = cdev->cd_fops;
+		cdput(cdev);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#90: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2142:
+	if (error < 0) {
[...]
-	else if(driver->major == 0)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#397: FILE: fs/char_dev.c:277:
+	sprintf(buffer, "%s(%d,%d)", cdev->cd_name ? cdev->cd_name : "unknown-char", major(dev), minor(dev));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
