Here are fixes for drivers/char. [These patches are independend and

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devexit is unnecessary
#85: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.h:91:
 extern void __devexit tpm_remove(struct pci_dev *);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.h:92:
+extern int tpm_pm_suspend(struct pci_dev *, pm_message_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_dev *' should also have an identifier name
#87: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.h:92:
+extern int tpm_pm_suspend(struct pci_dev *, pm_message_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'pm_message_t' should also have an identifier name
#87: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.h:92:
+extern int tpm_pm_suspend(struct pci_dev *, pm_message_t);
