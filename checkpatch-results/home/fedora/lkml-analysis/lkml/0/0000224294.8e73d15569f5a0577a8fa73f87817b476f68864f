 (2) bootmem.c now has a separate path to release pages to the main allocator

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'goal >= bdata->node_boot_start'
#65: FILE: mm/bootmem.c:177:
+	if (goal && (goal >= bdata->node_boot_start) &&
 	    ((goal >> PAGE_SHIFT) < bdata->node_low_pfn)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#163: FILE: mm/internal.h:13:
+extern void fastcall free_hot_cold_page(struct page *page, int cold);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#164: FILE: mm/internal.h:14:
+extern fastcall void __init __free_pages_bootmem(struct page *page, unsigned int order);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:WxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
