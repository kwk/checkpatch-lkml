WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct vc_data *' should also have an identifier name
#52: FILE: linux/console.h:44:
+	void	(*con_border)(struct vc_data *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "sw->con_border"
#160: FILE: char/console.c:2867:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
