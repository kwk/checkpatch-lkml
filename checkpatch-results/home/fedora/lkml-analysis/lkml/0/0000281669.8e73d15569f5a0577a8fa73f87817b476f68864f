module paramaters that are marked exportable in sysfs.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Was written by me and Rusty over and over many times during the past 6 months.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#46: 
--- a/include/linux/module.h	Fri May 14 15:57:30 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#63: FILE: include/linux/module.h:214:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#187: FILE: kernel/module.c:984:
+#define to_module_attr(n) container_of(n, struct module_attribute, attr);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#224: FILE: kernel/module.c:1021:
+static struct sysfs_ops module_sysfs_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

distractions when editing files.
