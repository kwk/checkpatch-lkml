WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated
#51: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_diag.c:9:
+ * $Revision: 1.51 $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#63: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_diag.c:409:

+				"DIAG call failed");

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#82: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_diag.c:424:
+	if (memcmp(label->label_id, DASD_DIAG_CMS1,
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
