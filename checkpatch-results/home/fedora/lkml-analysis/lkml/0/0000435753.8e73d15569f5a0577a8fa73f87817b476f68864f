Matthew Dharm made this 8 bytes from page 3F (all pages), patch-2.4.0-test8.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#59: FILE: linux/drivers/scsi/sd.c:1010:
+static int
+sd_do_mode_sense6(Scsi_Device *sdp, Scsi_Request *SRpnt,

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
