#42: 
OK, since Zwane thinks my patch is "good in that its minimal impact", here it is.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:164:
+extern void set_irq_info(unsigned int irq, cpumask_t mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
