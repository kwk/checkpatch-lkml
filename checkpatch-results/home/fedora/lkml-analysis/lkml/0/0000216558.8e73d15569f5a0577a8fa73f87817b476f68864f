WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#78: FILE: fs/Kconfig.binfmt:1:
+config SYS_USELIB
+	bool "sys_uselib syscall support (needed for old binaries)"
+	---help---
+	  Many old binaries (e.g. dynamically linked a.out binaries, and
+	  ELF binaries that are dynamically linked against libc5), require
+	  the sys_uselib syscall. However, on the typical Linux system, this
+	  code is just old cruft that no longer serves a purpose.
+
+	  If you are unsure, say "N" if you care more about security and
+	  trimming bloat, or say "Y" if you care more about compatibility
+	  with old software. (If you will answer "Y" or "M" to BINFMT_AOUT,
+	  below, you probably should answer "Y" here.)
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
