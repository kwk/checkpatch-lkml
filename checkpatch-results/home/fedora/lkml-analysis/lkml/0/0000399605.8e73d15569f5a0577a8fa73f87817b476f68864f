#34: 
Tuning seems to help quite a bit ... need to stick this into arch topo code.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#113: FILE: sched.c:766:
+                   (100*load > (NODE_THRESHOLD*this_load))$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
