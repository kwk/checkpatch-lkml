    This patch fixes various bad stuff that happens when you write to full or almost full

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#56: FILE: fs/reiserfs/file.c:1089:
+	    reiserfs_claim_blocks_to_be_allocated(inode->i_sb, 1 << (PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT - inode->i_blkbits));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
