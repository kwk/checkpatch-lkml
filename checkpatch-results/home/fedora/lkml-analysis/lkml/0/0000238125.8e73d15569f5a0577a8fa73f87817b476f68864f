WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name
#47: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:71:
+void cpu_remove(unsigned int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#65: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:190:
+	unsigned int cpu = NR_CPUS;

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#77: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:202:
+		cpu = NR_CPUS;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#93: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:218:
+	BUG_ON(cpu_present(cpu));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
