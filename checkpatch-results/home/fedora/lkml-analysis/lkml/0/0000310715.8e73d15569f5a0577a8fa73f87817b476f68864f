- [DVB] demux: fix nasty bug where setting multiple filters resulted in ts packet duplication

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'f' - possible side-effects?

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'feed->pid != pid'
#52: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_demux.c:415:
+		if ((feed->pid != pid) && (feed->pid != 0x2000))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'feed->pid != 0x2000'
#52: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_demux.c:415:
+		if ((feed->pid != pid) && (feed->pid != 0x2000))

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#56: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_demux.c:419:
+		 * if a PID is in multiple filters (e.g. video + PCR) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#128: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c:476:
+						if (fe->aquire_signal)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
