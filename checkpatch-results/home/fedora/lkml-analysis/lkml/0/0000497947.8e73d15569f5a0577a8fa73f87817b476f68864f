ishak> I tried to compile 2.4.14 and successfully detect the digital 21143 network

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#49: FILE: drivers/net/tulip/21142.c:191:
+					int startup = ! ((tp->chip_id == DC21143 && tp->revision == 65));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
