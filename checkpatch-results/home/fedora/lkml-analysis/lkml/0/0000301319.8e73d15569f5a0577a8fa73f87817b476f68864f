Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#374: FILE: arch/i386/mm/discontig.c:69:
+extern unsigned long init_pg_tables_end;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#383: FILE: arch/i386/mm/discontig.c:240:
+	system_start_pfn = min_low_pfn = PFN_UP(init_pg_tables_end);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
