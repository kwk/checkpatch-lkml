#47: 
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000010

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#502: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:1915:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ide_bus_type);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#915: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1289:
+		BUG_ON(hwgroup->drive != drive);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "drive->id"
#942: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1316:
+	if (drive->id != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#988: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-proc.c:315:
+	if (dev->driver) {
[...]
+				dev->driver->name, ide_drv->version);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#1374: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1336:
+void ide_register_subdriver(ide_drive_t *, ide_driver_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
