CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rd_bdev[unit]"
#82: FILE: drivers/block/rd.c:343:
+	if (rd_bdev[unit] == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#99: FILE: drivers/block/rd.c:373:
+		struct block_device *bdev = rd_bdev[i];
+		rd_bdev[i] = NULL;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
