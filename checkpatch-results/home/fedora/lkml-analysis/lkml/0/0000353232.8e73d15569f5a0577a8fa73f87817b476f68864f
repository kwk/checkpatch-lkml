#419: FILE: fs/proc/Kconfig.kcore:6:
+config KCORE_ELF
+        bool "ELF"
+        ---help---
+          If you enabled support for /proc file system then the file
+          /proc/kcore will contain the kernel core image. This can be used
+          in gdb:
+
+          $ cd /usr/src/linux ; gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore
+
+          You have two choices here: ELF and A.OUT. Selecting ELF will make
+          /proc/kcore appear in ELF core format as defined by the Executable
+          and Linking Format specification. Selecting A.OUT will choose the
+          old "a.out" format which may be necessary for some old versions
+          of binutils or on some architectures.
+
+          This is especially useful if you have compiled the kernel with the
+          "-g" option to preserve debugging information. It is mainly used
+          for examining kernel data structures on the live kernel so if you
+          don't understand what this means or are not a kernel hacker, just
+          leave it at its default value ELF.
+
+config KCORE_AOUT
+        bool "A.OUT"
+        help
+          Not necessary unless you're using a very out-of-date binutils
+          version.  You probably want KCORE_ELF.
