#26: 
This patch is meant to replace the patch from earlier that mask off SATA drives. After Arjan's question about one for 2.6 I got back in the code and realized this has to be done in 2 places for the 2.4.x driver, but only in one place for 2.6.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
