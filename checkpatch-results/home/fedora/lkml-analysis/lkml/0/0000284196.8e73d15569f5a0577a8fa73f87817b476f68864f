D: This patch adds cpu_present_map, cpu_present() and for_each_cpu_present()

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#151: FILE: include/linux/cpumask.h:42:
+#define cpu_present(cpu)		({ BUG_ON((cpu) != 0); 1; })

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'cpu' - possible side-effects?
#155: FILE: include/linux/cpumask.h:46:
+#define for_each_present_cpu(cpu) for (cpu = 0; cpu < 1; cpu++)
