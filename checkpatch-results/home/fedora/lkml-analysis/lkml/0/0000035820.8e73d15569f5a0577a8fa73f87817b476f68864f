CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev"
#58: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-dma.c:49:
+	if (dev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:139:
+extern struct page *alloc_pages_range(unsigned long low, unsigned long high,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
