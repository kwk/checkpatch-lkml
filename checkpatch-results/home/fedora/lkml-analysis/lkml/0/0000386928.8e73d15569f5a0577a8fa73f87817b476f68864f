#66: 
itself to filter events, with LT epoll you simply use epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_MOD)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#221: FILE: fs/eventpoll.c:1098:
+		if (revents & event->events) {
[...]
+		} else if (EP_IS_LINKED(&epi->rdllink))
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
