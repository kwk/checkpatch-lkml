root@arusha ~ {0:0} Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00100100

WARNING:TABSTOP: Statements should start on a tabstop

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (25, 33)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#206: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:91:
+extern int __kernel_text_address(unsigned long addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "module_text_address"
#271: FILE: kernel/module.c:692:
+	return module_text_address(addr) != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
