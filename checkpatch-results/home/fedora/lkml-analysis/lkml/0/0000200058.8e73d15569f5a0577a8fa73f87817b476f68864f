ERROR:IN_ATOMIC: do not use in_atomic in drivers
#88: FILE: drivers/acpi/osl.c:908:
+	if (in_atomic() || irqs_disabled())

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#142: FILE: drivers/video/aty/radeon_base.c:277:
+int radeon_force_sleep = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinitdata is unnecessary

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __devinitdata should be placed after radeonfb_dmi_table[]
#184: FILE: drivers/video/aty/radeon_pm.c:41:
+static struct dmi_system_id __devinitdata radeonfb_dmi_table[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
