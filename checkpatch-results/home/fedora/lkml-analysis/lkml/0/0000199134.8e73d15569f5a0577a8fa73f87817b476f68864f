Subject: [PATCH 1/4] sparsemem base: teach discontig about sparse ranges

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: include/asm-i386/page.h:122:
+extern int page_is_ram(unsigned long pagenr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
