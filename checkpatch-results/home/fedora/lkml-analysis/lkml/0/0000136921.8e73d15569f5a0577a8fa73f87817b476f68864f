CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#408: FILE: include/linux/ptrace.h:83:
+extern int ptrace_get_task_struct(long request, long pid, struct task_struct **childp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
