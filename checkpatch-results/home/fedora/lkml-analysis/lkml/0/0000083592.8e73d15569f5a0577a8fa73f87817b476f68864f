WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#92: FILE: drivers/char/sysrq.c:274:
+extern void kfree_show_stats(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
