ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#48: 
--- a/drivers/serial/8250.c	Tue Sep 30 19:10:48 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#91: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_pci.c:1556:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "Couldn't register serial port %s: %d\n", pci_name(dev), priv->line[i]);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
