WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#118: FILE: include/linux/inetdevice.h:75:
+#define IN_DEV_BLACKHOLE(in_dev)	(ipv4_devconf.blackhole || ((in_dev) && (in_dev)->cnf.blackhole))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
