#38: 
Prevent the MMC block driver from trying to access password-locked MMC cards.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#120: FILE: include/linux/mmc/card.h:59:
+#define MMC_STATE_LOCKED	(1<<5)		/* card is currently locked */
                         	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#120: FILE: include/linux/mmc/card.h:59:
+#define MMC_STATE_LOCKED	(1<<5)		/* card is currently locked */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
