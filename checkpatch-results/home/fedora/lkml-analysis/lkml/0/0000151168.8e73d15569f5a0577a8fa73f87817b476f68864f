The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#84: FILE: arch/um/kernel/mem.c:375:
+struct iomem_region *iomem_regions = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
