WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#60: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/e820.c:37:
+extern struct resource code_resource, data_resource;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
