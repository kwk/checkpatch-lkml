WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#85: FILE: drivers/scsi/st.c:4205:
+		/* Make sure that the minor numbers corresponding to the four
+		   first modes always get the same names */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
