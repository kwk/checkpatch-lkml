CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#123: FILE: fs/dcache.c:167:

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#214: FILE: fs/dcache.c:468:
+			struct list_head *tmp;
+			spin_lock(&pgdat->dentry_unused_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dentry->d_sb != sb'
#361: FILE: fs/dcache.c:593:
+			if (atomic_read(&dentry->d_count) ||
+			    (dentry->d_sb != sb) ||
+			    !list_empty(&dentry->d_lru)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
