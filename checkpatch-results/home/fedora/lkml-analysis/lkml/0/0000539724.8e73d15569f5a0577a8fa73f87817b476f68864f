WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'drivers' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

#59: FILE: cdrom/cdrom.c:355:
+		int n_entries = CDROM_MAX_CDROMS / (sizeof(unsigned long) * 8);
+		cdrom_numbers = kmalloc(n_entries * sizeof(unsigned long), GFP_KERNEL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#59: FILE: cdrom/cdrom.c:355:
+		cdrom_numbers = kmalloc(n_entries * sizeof(unsigned long), GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.
