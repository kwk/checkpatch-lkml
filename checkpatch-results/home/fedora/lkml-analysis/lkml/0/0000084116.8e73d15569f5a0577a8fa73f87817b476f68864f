ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#61: FILE: sys.c:1772:
+	struct task_struct* tsk = current;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#62: FILE: sys.c:1773:
+	struct task_struct* tsk = current;
+	read_lock(&tasklist_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'who != RUSAGE_SELF'
#63: FILE: sys.c:1774:
+	if ((who != RUSAGE_SELF) && (who != RUSAGE_CHILDREN)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'who != RUSAGE_CHILDREN'
#63: FILE: sys.c:1774:
+	if ((who != RUSAGE_SELF) && (who != RUSAGE_CHILDREN)) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tsk"
#67: FILE: sys.c:1778:
+		if (tsk == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

#69: FILE: sys.c:1780:
+		if ((tsk != current) && security_ptrace(current, tsk))
