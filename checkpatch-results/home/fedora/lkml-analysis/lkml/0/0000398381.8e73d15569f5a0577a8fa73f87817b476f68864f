Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#74: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2470:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#74: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2470:
+		while(spin_is_locked(lock)) {
+			cpu_relax();
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#74: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2470:
+		while(spin_is_locked(lock)) {

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
