+ * include/linux/preempt.h - macros for accessing and manipulating

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::
