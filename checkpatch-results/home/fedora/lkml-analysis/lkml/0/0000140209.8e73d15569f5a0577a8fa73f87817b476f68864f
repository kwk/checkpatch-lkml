existing entry.  This patch adds radix_tree_lookup_slot which returns pointer

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct radix_tree_root *' should also have an identifier name
#69: FILE: include/linux/radix-tree.h:49:
+void **radix_tree_lookup_slot(struct radix_tree_root *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#69: FILE: include/linux/radix-tree.h:49:
+void **radix_tree_lookup_slot(struct radix_tree_root *, unsigned long);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!slot"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "slot"
