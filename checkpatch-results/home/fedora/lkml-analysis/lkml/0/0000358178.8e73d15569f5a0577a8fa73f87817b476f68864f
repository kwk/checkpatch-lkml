#31: 
This latest patch I'm formally announcing has the base O1int changes so far 

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#81: FILE: kernel/sched.c:304:
+	int old_avg_time, new_avg_time;
+	new_avg_time = MIN_SLEEP_AVG;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#83: FILE: kernel/sched.c:306:
+	if (old_avg_time < new_avg_time) return;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#137: FILE: kernel/sched.c:392:
+			p->sleep_avg += (runtime - p->sleep_avg) * (MAX_SLEEP_AVG - runtime)/MAX_SLEEP_AVG;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
