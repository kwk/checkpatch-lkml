WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#43: 
#diff -u rc8/drivers/video/vesafb.c rc8/drivers/video/vesafb.c.new

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.
