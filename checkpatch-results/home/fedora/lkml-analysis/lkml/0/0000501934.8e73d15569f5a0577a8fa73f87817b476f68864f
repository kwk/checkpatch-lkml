Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:135:
+extern void out_of_memory(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
