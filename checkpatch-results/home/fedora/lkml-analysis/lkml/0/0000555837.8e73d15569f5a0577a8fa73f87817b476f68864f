#34: 
In routine pagetable_init() in arch/i386/mm/init.c, a pte gets installed before

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#61: FILE: init.c:369:
+			pte_base = pte = (pte_t *) alloc_bootmem_low_pages(PAGE_SIZE);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#61: FILE: init.c:369:
+			pte_base = pte = (pte_t *) alloc_bootmem_low_pages(PAGE_SIZE);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#71: FILE: init.c:379:
+				BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
