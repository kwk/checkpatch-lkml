WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#162: FILE: fs/jbd/journal.c:1981:
+	extern void journal_bad_superblock_size(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
