Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "current->time_ns"
#37: FILE: kernel/time.c:106:
+		if(current->time_ns != NULL){

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#39: FILE: kernel/time.c:108:
+			s64 now = timeval_to_ns(&ktv);
+			now += current->time_ns->offset;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
