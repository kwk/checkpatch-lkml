WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#44: FILE: arch/i386/pci/irq.c:201:
+	static const unsigned char irqmap[16] = { 0, 9, 3, 10, 4, 5, 7, 6, 1, 11, 0, 12, 0, 14, 0, 15 };

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after pirq_440gx[]

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
