#25: 
child ptrace stop following a PTRACE_SYSCALL due to a system call and a ptrace

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#81: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c:480:
+	/* the 0x80 provides a way for the tracing parent to distinguish
+	   between a syscall stop and SIGTRAP delivery */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
