CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:334:
+extern void maybe_sigio_broken(int fd, int read);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
