CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <halfMD4Transform>
#75: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:2224:
+	return halfMD4Transform(hash, keyptr->secret);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#117: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:2390:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#125: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:2398:
+	static unsigned int val = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#138: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:2411:
+/* $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#150: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:2423:
