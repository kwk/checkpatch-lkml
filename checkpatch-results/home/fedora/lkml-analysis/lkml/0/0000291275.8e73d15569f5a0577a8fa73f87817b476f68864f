ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#39: 
--- a/include/asm-x86_64/topology.h	Mon Mar 29 01:04:06 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#60: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/topology.h:23:
+	cpumask_t tmp;
+	cpus_and(tmp, mp_bus_to_cpumask[bus], cpu_online_map);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
