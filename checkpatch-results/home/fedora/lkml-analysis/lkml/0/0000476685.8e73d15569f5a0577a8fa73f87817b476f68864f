ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#33: FILE: sound/oss/i810_audio.c:941:
sg->busaddr=virt_to_bus(dmabuf->rawbuf+dmabuf->fragsize*i);

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#34: FILE: sound/oss/i810_audio.c:942:
                {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
