- Fix macro name clash. Fix build on UP and systems without CONFIG_MIGRATION

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#55: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:370:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#55: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:370:
+	int (*migratepage) (struct page *, struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#64: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1726:
+extern int buffer_migrate_page(struct page *, struct page *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#155: FILE: fs/buffer.c:3107:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
