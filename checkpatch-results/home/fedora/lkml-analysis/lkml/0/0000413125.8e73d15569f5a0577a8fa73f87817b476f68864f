# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#60: 
--- a/kernel/fork.c	Sun Nov 17 10:21:59 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#66: FILE: kernel/fork.c:411:
+		int * user_tid = tsk->user_tid;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#67: FILE: kernel/fork.c:412:
+		int * user_tid = tsk->user_tid;
+		tsk->user_tid = NULL;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
