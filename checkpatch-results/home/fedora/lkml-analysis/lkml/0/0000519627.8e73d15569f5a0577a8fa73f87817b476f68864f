ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#37: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:295:
+	if(state == 3 || dev->current_state == 3)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#37: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:295:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#43: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:301:
+		udelay(200);

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.
