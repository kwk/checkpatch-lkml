WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 151 exceeds 100 columns

+		printk("sg%d: dma=%llx, len=%u/%u, pfn=%lu\n", i, (unsigned long long) sg->dma_address, sg->length, sg->offset, page_to_pfn(sg->page));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
