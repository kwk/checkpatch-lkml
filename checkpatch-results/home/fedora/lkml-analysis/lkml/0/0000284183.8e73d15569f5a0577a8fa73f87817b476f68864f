WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#44: FILE: usb/core/config.c:90:
+static int usb_parse_interface(struct usb_host_config *config, unsigned char *buffer, int size, u8 inums[])

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bNumInterfaces>
#55: FILE: usb/core/config.c:111:
+	for (i = 0; i < config->desc.bNumInterfaces; ++i) {

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#62: FILE: usb/core/config.c:118:
+	if (!interface) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#71: FILE: usb/core/config.c:134:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
