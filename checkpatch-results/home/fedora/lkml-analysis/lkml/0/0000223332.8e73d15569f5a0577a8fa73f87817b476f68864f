WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#212: FILE: net/bluetooth/hci_sock.c:450:
+static int hci_sock_setsockopt(struct socket *sock, int level, int optname, char __user *optval, int len)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct proto_ops should normally be const
#230: FILE: net/bluetooth/hci_sock.c:570:
+static struct proto_ops hci_sock_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#322: FILE: net/bluetooth/rfcomm/core.c:67:
+#define rfcomm_lock()	down(&rfcomm_sem);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
