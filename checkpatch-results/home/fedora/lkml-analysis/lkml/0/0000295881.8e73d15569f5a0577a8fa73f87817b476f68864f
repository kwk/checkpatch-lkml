#27: 
Kobject: add decl_subsys_name() macro for users who want to set the subsystem name

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#35: 
--- a/include/linux/kobject.h	Mon Mar 15 15:29:10 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
