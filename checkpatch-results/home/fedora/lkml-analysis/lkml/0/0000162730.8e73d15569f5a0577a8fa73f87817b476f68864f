#35: 
Machines with ide-interfaces which do not have pci devices are crashing on boot

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#68: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:967:
+		return pcibus_to_node(hwif->pci_dev->bus);
+	else

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#90: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1059:
+	BUG_ON(hwif == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hwif"
#90: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1059:
+	BUG_ON(hwif == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#91: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1060:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
