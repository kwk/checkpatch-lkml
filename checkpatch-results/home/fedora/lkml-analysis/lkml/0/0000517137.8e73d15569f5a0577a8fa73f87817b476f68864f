WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#91: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:273:
+						struct page *extra = reclaim_page(z);
+						if (!extra)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#91: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:273:
+						if (!extra)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#100: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:282:
+			/* If that fails, fall back to rmqueue, but never let
+			*  free_pages go below pages_min...

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
