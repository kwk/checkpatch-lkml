Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
