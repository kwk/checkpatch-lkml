+	 * we recognize empty because they don't have children. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'rets[0] == 5'
#70: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/eeh.c:645:
+	if ((rets[0] == 5) && (dn->child == NULL)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dn->child == NULL'
#70: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/eeh.c:645:
+	if ((rets[0] == 5) && (dn->child == NULL)) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dn->child"
#70: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/eeh.c:645:
+	if ((rets[0] == 5) && (dn->child == NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#79: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/eeh.c:678:
+	if (rets[0] != 5) dump_stack();

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
