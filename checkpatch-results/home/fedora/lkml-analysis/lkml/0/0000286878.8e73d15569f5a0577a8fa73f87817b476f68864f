WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 127 exceeds 100 columns
#88: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:57:
+static char *psmouse_protocols[] = { "None", "PS/2", "PS2++", "PS2T++", "GenPS/2", "ImPS/2", "ImExPS/2", "SynPS/2", "LBPS/2" };

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph

FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#211: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/lbtouch.c:89:
+	psmouse->ptport = port = kmalloc(sizeof(struct psmouse_ptport), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*port)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct psmouse_ptport)...)
#211: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/lbtouch.c:89:
+	psmouse->ptport = port = kmalloc(sizeof(struct psmouse_ptport), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
