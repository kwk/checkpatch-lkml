ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#42: FILE: lib/brlock.c:21:
 brlock_read_lock_t __brlock_array[NR_CPUS][__BR_IDX_MAX] =
+	{ [0 ... NR_CPUS-1] = { [0 ... __BR_IDX_MAX-1] = RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED } };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
