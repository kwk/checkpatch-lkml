WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#70: FILE: kexec/arch/i386/kexec-elf-x86.c:211:
+		 * it does not get stomped by kernel. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#73: FILE: kexec/arch/i386/kexec-elf-x86.c:214:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
