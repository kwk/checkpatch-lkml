WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#58: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_RCUPDATE_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#67: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:10:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

#117: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/process.c:89:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

#267: FILE: arch/parisc/kernel/process.c:78:
+		while (!current->need_resched && !is_rcu_pending()) {
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
