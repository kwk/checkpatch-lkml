#36: 
struct neigh_ops currently has a destructor field, but not a constructor field.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct neighbour *' should also have an identifier name
#118: FILE: include/net/neighbour.h:71:
+	void	(*neigh_destructor)(struct neighbour *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around function pointer (neigh->parms->neigh_destructor)
#157: FILE: net/core/neighbour.c:590:
+		(neigh->parms->neigh_destructor)(neigh);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
