WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#56: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/iSeries_htab.c:21:
+static spinlock_t iSeries_hlocks[64] __cacheline_aligned_in_smp = { [0 ... 63] = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED};

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#86: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/iSeries_htab.c:59:
+	BUG_ON(lhpte.dw0.dw0.v);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ptep"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
