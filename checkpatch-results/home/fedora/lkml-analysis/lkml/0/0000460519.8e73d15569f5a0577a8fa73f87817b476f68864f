WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments

#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8361          0x3112

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#46: FILE: home/erich/coding/v2.4.18/drivers/pci/quirks.c:490:
+	{ PCI_FIXUP_FINAL,	PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA,	PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C598_1,	quirk_vialatency },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
