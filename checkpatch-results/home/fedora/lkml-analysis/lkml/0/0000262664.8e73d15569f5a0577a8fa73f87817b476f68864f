Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#74: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:714:
+#define OHCI_OCR		(1 << 3)	/* ownership change request */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#75: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:715:
+#define OHCI_CTRL_IR		(1 << 8)	/* interrupt routing */

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#76: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:716:
+#define OHCI_INTR_OC		(1 << 30)	/* ownership change */

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#78: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:718:
+int disable_legacy_usb __initdata = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#84: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:724:
+__setup("no-usb-legacy", usb_legacy_disable);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#118: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:758:
+		if (base == NULL) return;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!base"
#118: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:758:
+		if (base == NULL) return;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#122: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:762:

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#141: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:853:
+	{ PCI_FIXUP_FINAL,	PCI_ANY_ID,		PCI_ANY_ID,		quirk_usb_disable_smm_bios },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
