ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#55: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:203:
+void device_lock(struct device * dev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
