ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#124: FILE: Makefile:1291:
+ $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#138: FILE: Makefile:1305:
+	$(Q)$(MAKE) -rR -f $(srctree)/scripts/Makefile.modpost

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
