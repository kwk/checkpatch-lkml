WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#42: FILE: drivers/mmc/wbsd.c:1985:
+	BUG_ON(host == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!host"
#42: FILE: drivers/mmc/wbsd.c:1985:
+	BUG_ON(host == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
