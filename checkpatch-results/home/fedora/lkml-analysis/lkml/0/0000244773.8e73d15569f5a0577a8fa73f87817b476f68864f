CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#53: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:13:
+#include <asm/uaccess.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#86: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:180:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(do_softirq);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#133: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:148:
+static unsigned long print_context_stack(struct thread_info *tinfo, unsigned long *stack,
 			 unsigned long ebp)
