+/*****************************************************************************

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated

+/* $Date: 2006/10/31 18:57:51 $ $RCSfile: version.h,v $ $Revision: 1.3 $ */

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.
