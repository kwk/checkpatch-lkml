Bit too specific to -mm2, what about the the attached?

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#84: FILE: nv-linux.h:190:
+#define NV_PMD_OFFSET(address, pg_dir) \
+    pmd_offset_map(pg_dir, address);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
