WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#46: FILE: fs/mountfd.c:14:
+extern int do_umount(struct vfsmount *mnt, int flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
