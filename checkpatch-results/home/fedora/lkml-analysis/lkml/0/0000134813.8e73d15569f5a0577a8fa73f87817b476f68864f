Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

distractions when editing files.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#64: FILE: sysctl.c:60:
+extern int su_pid;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#72: FILE: sysctl.c:513:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
