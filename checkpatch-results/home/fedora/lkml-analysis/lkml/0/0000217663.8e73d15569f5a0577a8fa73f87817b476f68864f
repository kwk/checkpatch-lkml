CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#79: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/w83627hf.c:1205:
+	/* Make sure the pins are configured for input
+	   There must be at least five (VRM 9), and possibly 6 (VRM 10) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#79: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/w83627hf.c:1205:
+	   There must be at least five (VRM 9), and possibly 6 (VRM 10) */

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#83: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/w83627hf.c:1209:
+		dev_dbg(&client->dev, "GPIO5 not configured for VID "
+			"function\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
