WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#35: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .12
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#288: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_queue.c:74:
+	 * softirq, e.g.  We therefore emulate this by local_bh_disable() */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

#309: FILE: net/sched/sch_netem.c:188:
+			struct Qdisc *rootq = sch->dev->qdisc;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
