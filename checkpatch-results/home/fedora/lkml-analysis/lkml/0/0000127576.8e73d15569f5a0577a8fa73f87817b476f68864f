CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:23:
+extern void delayacct_swapin(struct timespec *start, struct timespec *end);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u64' over 'uint64_t'
#84: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:551:
+	uint64_t swapin_delay;	/* wait for pages to be swapped in */

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#85: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:552:
+	uint32_t swapin_count;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#101: FILE: mm/memory.c:2205:
+		int ret;
+		__attribute__((unused)) struct timespec start, end;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: __always_unused or __maybe_unused is preferred over __attribute__((__unused__))

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
