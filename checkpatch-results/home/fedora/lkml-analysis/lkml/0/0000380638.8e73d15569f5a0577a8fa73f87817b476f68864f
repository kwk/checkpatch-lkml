Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#72: FILE: arch/i386/oprofile/init.c:20:
+extern void nmi_exit(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - void __exit oprofile_arch_exit() should probably be void __exit oprofile_arch_exit(void)

+void __exit oprofile_arch_exit()

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)
