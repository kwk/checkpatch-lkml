Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#155: FILE: home/rem/views/linux-2.5.7-pre1/kernel/acct.c:169:
+	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(&acct_globals.lock));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#155: FILE: home/rem/views/linux-2.5.7-pre1/kernel/acct.c:169:
+	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(&acct_globals.lock));

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/locking/lockdep-design.html#annotations

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#244: FILE: home/rem/views/linux-2.5.7-pre1/kernel/acct.c:212:
+		if (IS_ERR(tmp)) {
+			return (PTR_ERR(tmp));
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#245: FILE: home/rem/views/linux-2.5.7-pre1/kernel/acct.c:213:
+			return (PTR_ERR(tmp));

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
