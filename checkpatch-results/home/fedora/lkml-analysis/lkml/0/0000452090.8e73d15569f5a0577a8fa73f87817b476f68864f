CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#70: FILE: drivers/ide/icside.c:495:
+	count = ch->sg_nents = ide_build_sglist(drive, rq);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
