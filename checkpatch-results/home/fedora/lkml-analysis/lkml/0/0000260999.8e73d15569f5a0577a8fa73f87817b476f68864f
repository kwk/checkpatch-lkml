CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:18:
+extern void cpuset_init_smp(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#103: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1300:
+ * Description: Initialize cpus_allowed after cpu_possible_map is initialized $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
