#36: 
Subject: [2.5 patch] fix the compilation of drivers/net/tokenring/tms380tr.c

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 136 exceeds 100 columns
#84: FILE: drivers/net/tokenring/tms380tr.c:1461:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: buffer (virt): %lx\n", dev->name, (long) ((char *)&tp->scb - (char *)tp) + (long) tp->dmabuffer);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
