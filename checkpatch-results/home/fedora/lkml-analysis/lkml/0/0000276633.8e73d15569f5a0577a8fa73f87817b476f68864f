Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#244: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:522:
+static inline void set_abs_params(struct input_dev *dev, int axis, int min, int max, int fuzz, int flat)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#347: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:625:
+	psmouse->private = priv = kmalloc(sizeof(struct synaptics_data), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*priv)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct synaptics_data)...)
#347: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:625:
+	psmouse->private = priv = kmalloc(sizeof(struct synaptics_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
