WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#54: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/rtasd.c:51:
+extern int no_logging;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#118: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/nvram.c:46:
+int no_logging = 1; ^I/* Until we initialize everything,$

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#120: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/nvram.c:48:
+			 * anything */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#129: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/nvram.c:643:
+	if (no_logging) {
 		return -EPERM;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
