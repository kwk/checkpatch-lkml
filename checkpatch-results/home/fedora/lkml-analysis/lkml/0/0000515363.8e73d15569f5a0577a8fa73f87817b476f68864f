WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#153: FILE: fs/super.c:1471:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#191: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:111:
+#define MS_NOUSER	(1<<31)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
