#if (a | b | MAY_OWNER_OVERRIDE) & (c | d | MAY_OWNER_OVERRIDE)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#59: FILE: linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:42:
+#if (MAY_SATTR | MAY_TRUNC | MAY_LOCK | MAY_LOCAL_ACCESS) & (MAY_READ | MAY_WRITE | MAY_EXEC | MAY_OWNER_OVERRIDE)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
