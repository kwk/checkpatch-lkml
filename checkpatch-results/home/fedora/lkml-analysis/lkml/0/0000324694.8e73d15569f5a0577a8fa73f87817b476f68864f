#39: 
> Here's a patch for ide-tape.c that gets ide-tape working on the 2.6 kernel.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#109: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/ide-tape.c		Version 1.18	Nov, 2003

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#142: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:656:
+#define IDETAPE_WAIT_CMD		(900*HZ)
                         		    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#176: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1679:
+	if ((pc->c[0] == IDETAPE_READ_CMD || pc->c[0] == IDETAPE_WRITE_CMD)
+	    && pc->c[4] == 0 && pc->c[3] == 0 && pc->c[2] == 0) { /* length==0 */

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#241: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:2579:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "ide-tape: %s: I/O error, ",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#242: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:2580:
+				printk(KERN_ERR "ide-tape: %s: I/O error, ",
+						tape->name);

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'tape->asc == 0x3A'
#262: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:3341:
+		if ((tape->sense_key == 2 && tape->asc == 4 && tape->ascq == 2)
+		    || (tape->asc == 0x3A)) {	/* no media */

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#263: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:3342:
+		if ((tape->sense_key == 2 && tape->asc == 4 && tape->ascq == 2)
+		    || (tape->asc == 0x3A)) {	/* no media */

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#346: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:4091:
+			bytes_read = idetape_queue_rw_tail(drive, REQ_IDETAPE_READ, 0, tape->merge_stage->bh);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
