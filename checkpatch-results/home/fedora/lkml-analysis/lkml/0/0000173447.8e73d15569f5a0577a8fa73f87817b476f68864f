# Generate list of calls to pci_enable_device

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

+	/* Need to save the PCI config space because some firmware
+	   will leave devices in D3hot on boot and some devices

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
