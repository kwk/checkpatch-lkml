# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#60: 
--- a/fs/ext2/super.c	Thu Jan  1 16:29:17 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
