ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#318: FILE: kernel/futex.c:93:
+static int __get_page_keys(unsigned long addr, unsigned long * keys)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "page"
#391: FILE: kernel/futex.c:154:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#418: FILE: kernel/futex.c:172:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#453: FILE: kernel/futex.c:197:
+		    && this->offset == offset) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
