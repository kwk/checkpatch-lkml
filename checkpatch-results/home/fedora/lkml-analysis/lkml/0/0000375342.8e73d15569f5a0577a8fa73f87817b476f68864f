WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#44: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:301:
+	if (!vc) {
+		return -ENODEV;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.h:41:
+extern int set_con2fb_map(int unit, int newidx);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#74: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:1038:
+			return set_con2fb_map(con2fb.console-1, con2fb.framebuffer);
 			                                    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
