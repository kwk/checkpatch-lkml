ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#162: FILE: crypto/deflate.c:157:
+^I                     u8 *dst, unsigned int *dlen)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#180: FILE: crypto/deflate.c:175:
+	       && stream->total_out < *dlen - DEFLATE_PCOMPR_RESERVE) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#201: FILE: crypto/deflate.c:196:
+ $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#276: FILE: crypto/deflate.c:215:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#283: FILE: crypto/deflate.c:222:
+	 * skip them if they are.*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
