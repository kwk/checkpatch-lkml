modification time on the file to be updated.  This lack can cause corruption

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#108: FILE: fs/inode.c:1248:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(inode_update_time);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#168: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1780:
+extern void inode_update_time(struct inode *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#168: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1780:
+extern void inode_update_time(struct inode *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

 							nr_pages_dirtied);
