ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#37: 
--- a/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-piix4.c	Tue Dec 30 12:29:37 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#44: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-piix4.c:103:
+/* If fix_hstcfg is set to anything different from 0, we reset one of the
+   registers to be a valid value. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
