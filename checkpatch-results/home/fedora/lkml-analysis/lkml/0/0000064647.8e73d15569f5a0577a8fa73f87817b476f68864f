ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <NoImage>
#69: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:694:
+			strcpy(header->sig, NoImage);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#71: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:696:
+			result = changed = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
