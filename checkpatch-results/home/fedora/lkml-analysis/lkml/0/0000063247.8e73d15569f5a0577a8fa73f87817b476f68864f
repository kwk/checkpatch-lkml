ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#63: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:1079:
+			if (!up_flag) put_queue(vc, 0xf1);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#80: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:58:
+static int atkbd_scroll = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#184: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:252:
+	if (value == 3) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.

spaces are never used for indentation.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
