Here is a concrete example of how this works with a simple "bt" test-program

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/elf.h> instead of <asm/elf.h>
#80: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:4:
+#include <asm/elf.h>

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#93: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:84:
+	/* Do _not_ mark this area as readable, cuz not the entire range may be readable
+	   (e.g., due to execute-only pages or holes) and the tools that read

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
