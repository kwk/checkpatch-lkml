CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#217: FILE: include/asm-m68k/signal.h:216:
+extern void ptrace_signal_deliver(struct pt_regs *regs, void *cookie);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
