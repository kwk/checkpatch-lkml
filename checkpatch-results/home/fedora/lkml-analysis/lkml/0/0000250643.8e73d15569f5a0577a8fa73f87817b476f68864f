directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
