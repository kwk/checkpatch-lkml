Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#95: FILE: tmp/block_dev.c:579:
+int blkdev_get(struct block_device *bdev, mode_t mode, unsigned flags, int kind)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#105: FILE: tmp/block_dev.c:589:
+	struct dentry fake_dentry = {};
+	fake_file.f_mode = mode;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#146: FILE: tmp/block_dev.c:612:
+	return do_open(bdev, inode, filp);
