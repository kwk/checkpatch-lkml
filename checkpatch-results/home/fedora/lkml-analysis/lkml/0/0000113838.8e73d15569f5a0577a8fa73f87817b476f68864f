CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'clock' - possible side-effects?

+#define _clock_to_base(clock) (clock <= CLOCK_MONOTONIC ? clock : clock - 2)

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#101: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:141:
+#define set_curr_timer(b, t)	do { (b)->curr_timer = (t); } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#176: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:728:
+  * mode:        HRTIMER_ABS if absolute mode
+*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'union restart_union *' should also have an identifier name
#428: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:153:
+		long (*fn)(union restart_union *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
