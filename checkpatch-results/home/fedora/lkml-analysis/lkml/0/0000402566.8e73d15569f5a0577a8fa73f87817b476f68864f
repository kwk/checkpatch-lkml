Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

+		cpu_data[freq->cpu].loops_per_jiffy = cpufreq_scale(loops_per_jiffy_ref, ref_freq, freq->new);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
