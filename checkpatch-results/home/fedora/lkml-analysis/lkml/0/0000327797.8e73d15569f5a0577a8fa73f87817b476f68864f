ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#85: FILE: drivers/media/video/meye.c:865:
+static irqreturn_t meye_irq(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
