ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#70: FILE: usb/media/vicam.c:658:
+			if (copy_from_user(&vw, arg, sizeof(vw)))

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
