which all corrispond with the same thing as the "normal" class devices
          ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dev_uevent', this function's name, in a string
#73: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:192:
+				pr_debug("%s - dev_uevent() returned %d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#74: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:193:
+					 __FUNCTION__, retval);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#121: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:278:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#129: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:433:
+	if ((error = device_add_attrs(dev)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <AttrsError>
#130: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:434:
+		goto AttrsError;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#138: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:465:
+ ^Idevice_remove_attrs(dev);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#138: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:465:
+ ^Idevice_remove_attrs(dev);$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#138: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:465:
+ ^Idevice_remove_attrs(dev);$

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo		* bar" should be "foo		*bar"
#159: FILE: include/linux/device.h:154:
+	struct device_attribute		* dev_attrs;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
