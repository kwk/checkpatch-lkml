#29: 
This fixes a bug with Novell Netware Servers (in my case 3.12) sending error 

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
#52: FILE: fs/ncpfs/ncplib_kernel.c:275:
+	DPRINTK("NCPFS : ncp_optain_info for: %s\n",path);
 	                                           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#53: FILE: fs/ncpfs/ncplib_kernel.c:276:
+	if(path==NULL)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!path"
#53: FILE: fs/ncpfs/ncplib_kernel.c:276:
+	if(path==NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
