ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#94: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1102:
=20

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#109: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1103:

+/* code is in security.c or kernel/sys.c if !SECURITY */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#110: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1104:
+extern int FASTCALL(capable(int cap));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
