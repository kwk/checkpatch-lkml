ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#99: FILE: spi.c:323:
+struct spi_master* bus_num_to_master(u16 bus_num)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
