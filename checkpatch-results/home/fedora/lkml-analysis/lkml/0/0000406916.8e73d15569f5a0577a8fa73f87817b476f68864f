Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#73: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:93:
+extern int pse_disable;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#99: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:45:
+int pse_disable __initdata = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
