Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#79: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:263:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#83: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:267:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
