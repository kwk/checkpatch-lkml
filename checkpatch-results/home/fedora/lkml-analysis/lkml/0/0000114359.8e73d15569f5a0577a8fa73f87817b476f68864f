#27: 
In this error path, when the interface has had a problem, we call dev_close(),

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#59: FILE: arch/um/drivers/net_kern.c:71:
+static void uml_dev_close(void* dev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
