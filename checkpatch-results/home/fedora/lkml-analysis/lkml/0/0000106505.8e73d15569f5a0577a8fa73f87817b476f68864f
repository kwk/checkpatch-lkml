Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#59: FILE: kernel/module.c:144:
+	unsigned int i;
+	for (i = 0; start + i < stop; i++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#94: FILE: kernel/module.c:168:
+		i = lookup_symbol(name, __start___ksymtab_gpl,
+					__stop___ksymtab_gpl);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#121: FILE: kernel/module.c:185:
+^I^I^Ii = lookup_symbol(name, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
