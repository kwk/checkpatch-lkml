patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#1133: FILE: include/linux/relayfs_fs.h:186:
+extern int relayfs_remove(struct dentry *dentry);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
