ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#52: FILE: lib/inflate.c:189:
+        x = readbits(&b, &k, j);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#84: FILE: lib/inflate.c:220:
+	for( ; *k < n; *k += 8)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#101: FILE: lib/inflate.c:234:
+	u32 r = readbits(b, k, n);
+	dumpbits(b, k, n);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#259: FILE: lib/inflate.c:759:
+	nd = 1 + pullbits(&b, &k, 5); /* number of distance codes */
 	^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
