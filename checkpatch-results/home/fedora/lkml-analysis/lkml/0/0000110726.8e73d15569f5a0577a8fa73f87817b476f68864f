CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#59: FILE: mm/mempool.c:299:
+	int order = (int) pool_data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#60: FILE: mm/mempool.c:300:
+	int order = (int) pool_data;
+	return alloc_pages(gfp_mask, order);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
