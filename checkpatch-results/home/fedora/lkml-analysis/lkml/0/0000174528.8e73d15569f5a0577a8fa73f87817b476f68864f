#29: 
Add bus_find_device() and driver_find_device() which allow a callback for each

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"

+struct device * bus_find_device(struct bus_type * bus, struct device * start,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
