ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#117: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:2634:
+                               softback_in = softback_curr = p;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#117: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:2634:
+                               softback_in = softback_curr = p;$

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#117: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:2634:
+                               softback_in = softback_curr = p;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
