CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: kernel/power/power.h:116:
+extern int suspend_enter(suspend_state_t state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <OutS3>
#102: FILE: kernel/power/user.c:282:
+				goto OutS3;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
