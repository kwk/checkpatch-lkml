#29: 
This patch favors the local node more than the others to prevent unnecessary task migration by doing a better estimation of the after-migration load (see inline C documentation).

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#40: 
--- a/kernel/sched.c	Thu Aug 21 16:10:41 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#56: FILE: kernel/sched.c:804:
+	node = pnode = cpu_to_node(best_cpu);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#65: FILE: kernel/sched.c:811:
+^I^I * ^Iload(other node) + 1 < load(our node) - 1$

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#70: FILE: kernel/sched.c:815:
+		load = NR_CPUS * (atomic_read(&node_nr_running[i]) + ((i != pnode) << 1)) / nr_cpus_node(i);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#70: FILE: kernel/sched.c:815:
+		load = NR_CPUS * (atomic_read(&node_nr_running[i]) + ((i != pnode) << 1)) / nr_cpus_node(i);
