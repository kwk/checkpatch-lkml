Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
