WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments

#define TASK_RUNNING            0

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: static const char * array should probably be static const char * const
#76: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2040:
+	static const char * stat_nam[] = { "R", "S", "D", "T", "Z", "W" };

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#76: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2040:
+	static const char * stat_nam[] = { "R", "S", "D", "T", "Z", "W" };

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
