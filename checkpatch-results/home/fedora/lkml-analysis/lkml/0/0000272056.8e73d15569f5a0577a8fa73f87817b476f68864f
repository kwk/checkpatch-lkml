CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ret"
#92: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-dma.c:29:
+	if (ret == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#100: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-dma.c:37:
+		    (((unsigned long)*dma_handle + size - 1) & ~(unsigned long)dev->coherent_dma_mask)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
