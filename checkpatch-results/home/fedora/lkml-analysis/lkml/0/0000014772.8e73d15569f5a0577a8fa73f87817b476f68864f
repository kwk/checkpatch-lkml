#130: 
We add a save link for O_DIRECT writes to protect the i_size against the crashes before we actually finish the I/O. If we hit an -ENOSPC in aops->prepare_write(), we would do a truncate() to release the blocks which might have got initialized. Now the truncate would add another save link for the same inode causing a reiserfs panic for having multiple save links for the same inode.
