ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#82: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mpc.c:95:
+^I^Iresult = wait_event_interruptible_timeout(i2c->queue, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#83: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mpc.c:96:
+		result = wait_event_interruptible_timeout(i2c->queue, 
+			(i2c->interrupt & CSR_MIF), timeout * HZ);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#85: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mpc.c:98:
+		if (unlikely(result < 0))
[...]
+		else if (unlikely(!(i2c->interrupt & CSR_MIF))) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
