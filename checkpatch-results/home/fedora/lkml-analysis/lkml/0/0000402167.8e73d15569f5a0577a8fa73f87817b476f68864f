Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/drivers/char/agp/amd-k8-agp.c	Tue Jan  7 12:51:49 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#83: FILE: drivers/char/agp/generic.c:323:
+		u8 agp = pci_find_capability(device, PCI_CAP_ID_AGP);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
