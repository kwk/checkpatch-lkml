Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#133: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:573:
 static struct rcu_torture_ops *torture_ops[] =
+	{ &rcu_ops, &rcu_sync_ops, &rcu_bh_ops, &rcu_bh_sync_ops,

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
