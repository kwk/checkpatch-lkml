#62: 
This patch introduces the concept of a mountpoint file descriptor (mountfd).

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#144: FILE: fs/mountfd.c:1:
+#include <linux/fs.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#220: FILE: fs/mountfd.c:77:
+static struct file_operations mfd_file_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IXUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0555'.
#228: FILE: fs/mountfd.c:85:
+	inode->i_mode = S_IFREG | S_IRUGO | S_IXUGO;

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#230: FILE: fs/mountfd.c:87:
+	inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#255: FILE: fs/mountfd.c:112:
+		struct dentry *err = newmfd->dentry;
+		kfree(newmfd);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
