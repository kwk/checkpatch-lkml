WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#98: FILE: include/linux/acct.h:39:

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
