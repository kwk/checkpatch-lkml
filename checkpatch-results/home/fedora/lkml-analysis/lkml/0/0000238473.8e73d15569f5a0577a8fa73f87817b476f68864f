WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#85: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:88:
+		unsigned long addr = do_brk(start, end - start);
+		if (BAD_ADDR(addr))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#88: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:91:
+	current->mm->start_brk = current->mm->brk = end;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#112: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:665:
+			retval = set_brk (elf_bss + load_bias,

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
