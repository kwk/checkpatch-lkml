CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro

+#define PREFETCH_NORMAL		(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#282: FILE: include/linux/swap-prefetch.h:36:
+extern void aggressive_swap_prefetch(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
