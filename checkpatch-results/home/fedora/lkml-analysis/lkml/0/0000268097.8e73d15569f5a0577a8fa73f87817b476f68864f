ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#62: FILE: arch/i386/boot/edd.S:12:
=20

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#108: FILE: include/linux/edd.h:53:
+#define GETDISKTYPE 0x15          /* int13 AH=3D0x15 is Get Disk Type comm=
+#define HARDDRIVEPRESENT 0x03     /* int13 AH=3D15 return code in AH */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
