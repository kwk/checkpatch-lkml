# Add support for rq->bio based taskfile.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#109: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:127:
 	if (!end_that_request_first(rq, uptodate, nr_sectors)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
