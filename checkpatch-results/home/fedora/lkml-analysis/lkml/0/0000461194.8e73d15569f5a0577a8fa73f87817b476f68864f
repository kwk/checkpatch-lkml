WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#91: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:1268:
+			if (!choice || (drive->sleep && (!choice->sleep || time_after(choice->sleep, drive->sleep)))) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#108: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:1327:
+			printk(KERN_ERR"%s: error: not busy while queueing!\n", drive->name);

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#300: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:2162:
+	n_irq = n_ch = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
