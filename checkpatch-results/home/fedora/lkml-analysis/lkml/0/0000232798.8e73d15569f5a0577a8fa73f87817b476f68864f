ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#73: FILE: include/linux/init_task.h:71:
\

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#106: FILE: init/main.c:664:
+	if (current->policy == SCHED_RR) {
+		current->prio = current->rt_priority - 1;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
