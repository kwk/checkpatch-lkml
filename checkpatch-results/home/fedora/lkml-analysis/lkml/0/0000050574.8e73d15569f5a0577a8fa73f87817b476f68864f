Opps looks like I attached the wrong patch in the original email :(

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#81: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:560:
+#ifdef CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG_RESERVE $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#84: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:562:
advance,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#109: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:31:
+	struct resource *res;
+	res = kzalloc(sizeof(struct resource), GFP_KERNEL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*res)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct resource)...)
#109: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:31:
+	res = kzalloc(sizeof(struct resource), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#110: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:32:
+	BUG_ON(!res);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#117: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:39:
+		printk("System RAM resource %llx - %llx cannot be added\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
