The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#36: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .17
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#311: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c:37:
+^Iunion acpi_object ^I*out_obj;$

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#335: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c:69:
+	osc_dw0 = *((u32 *) out_obj->buffer.pointer);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#345: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c:79:
+			global_ctrlsets = *((u32 *)(out_obj->buffer.pointer+8));
 			                                                   ^

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#373: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c:106:
+^Iunion acpi_object ^I*out_obj;$

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#397: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c:136:
+	osc_dw0 = *((u32 *) out_obj->buffer.pointer);

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#441: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:645:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "PCI: VIA IRQ fixup for %s, from %d to %d\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#442: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:646:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "PCI: VIA IRQ fixup for %s, from %d to %d\n",
 			pci_name(dev), irq, new_irq);

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after asus_hides_smbus
#476: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:890:
+static int __initdata asus_hides_smbus;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#511: FILE: fs/locks.c:717:
+static int flock_lock_file(struct file *filp, struct file_lock *request)
                                         ^^^^

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!new_fl"
#536: FILE: fs/locks.c:745:
+	if (new_fl == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
