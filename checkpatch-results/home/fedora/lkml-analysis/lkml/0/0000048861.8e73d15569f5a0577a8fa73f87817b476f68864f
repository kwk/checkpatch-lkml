A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#121: FILE: fork.c:126:
+void fastcall free_task_delayed(struct task_struct *task);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
