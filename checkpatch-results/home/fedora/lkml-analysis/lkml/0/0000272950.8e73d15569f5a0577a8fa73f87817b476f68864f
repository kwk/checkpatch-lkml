CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#67: FILE: drivers/char/raw.c:132:
+	class_simple_device_add(raw_class, MKDEV(RAW_MAJOR, rq.raw_minor),
+				      NULL, "raw%d", rq.raw_minor);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#83: FILE: drivers/char/raw.c:208:
+				else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
