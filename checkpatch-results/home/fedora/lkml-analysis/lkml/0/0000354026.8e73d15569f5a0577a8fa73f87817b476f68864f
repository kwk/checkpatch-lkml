ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#34: 
--- a/fs/Kconfig	Wed Jul 16 14:49:58 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

+	---help---
+	  Relayfs is a high-speed data relay filesystem designed to provide
+	  an efficient mechanism for tools and facilities to relay large
+	  amounts of data from kernel space to user space.  It's not useful
+	  on its own, and should only be enabled if other facilities that
+	  need it are enabled, such as for example dynamic printk or the
+	  Linux Trace Toolkit.
+
+	  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/relayfs.txt> for further
+	  information.
+
+	  This file system is also available as a module ( = code which can be
+	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
+	  The module is called relayfs.  If you want to compile it as a
+	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
