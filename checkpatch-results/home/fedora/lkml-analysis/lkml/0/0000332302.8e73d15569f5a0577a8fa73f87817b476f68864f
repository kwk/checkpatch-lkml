           ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#60: FILE: kernel/resource.c:282:
+ * become childs of the new resource. $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#127: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:93:
+extern int insert_resource(struct resource *parent, struct resource *new);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
