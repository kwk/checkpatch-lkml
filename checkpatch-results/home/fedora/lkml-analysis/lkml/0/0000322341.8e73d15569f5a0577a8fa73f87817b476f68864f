CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'arg == F_RDLCK'
#69: FILE: new/src/linux-2.4.22/fs/locks.c:1300:
+	if ((arg == F_RDLCK)
+	    && ((atomic_read(&dentry->d_count) > 1)
+		|| (atomic_read(&inode->i_count) > 1))) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#70: FILE: new/src/linux-2.4.22/fs/locks.c:1301:
+	if ((arg == F_RDLCK)

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#71: FILE: new/src/linux-2.4.22/fs/locks.c:1302:
+	    && ((atomic_read(&dentry->d_count) > 1)
+		|| (atomic_read(&inode->i_count) > 1))) {

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#72: FILE: new/src/linux-2.4.22/fs/locks.c:1303:
+		|| (atomic_read(&inode->i_count) > 1))) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
