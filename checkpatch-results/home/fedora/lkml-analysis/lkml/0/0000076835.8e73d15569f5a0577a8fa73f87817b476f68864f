WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#77: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#82: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#83: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c:2:
+ * drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#89: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c:8:
+ * Copyright 2006 (c) MontaVista Software, Inc. $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/bitops.h> instead of <asm/bitops.h>

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct rtc_class_ops should normally be const
#222: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c:141:
+static struct rtc_class_ops pl031_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#254: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c:173:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*ldata)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct pl031_local)...)
#255: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c:174:
+	ldata = kmalloc(sizeof(struct pl031_local), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
