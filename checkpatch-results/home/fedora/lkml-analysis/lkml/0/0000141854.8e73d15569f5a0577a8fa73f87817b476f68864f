+ * Don't even think about derefencing 'cs' after the cpuset use count
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#688: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1622:
+	BUG_ON(!(tsk->flags & PF_EXITING));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
