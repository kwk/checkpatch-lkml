CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u64' over 'uint64_t'

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#530: FILE: fs/xfs/xfs_trans.c:161:

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#532: FILE: fs/xfs/xfs_trans.c:163:

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
