WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'hda' may be misspelled - perhaps 'had'?
#34: 
e.g. cat /sys/block/hda/hda5/dev should return 3:5 instead of 0305
                    ^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#48: FILE: fs/partitions/check.c:226:
+^Idev_t dev = MKDEV(disk->major, disk->first_minor + p->partno); $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#49: FILE: fs/partitions/check.c:227:
+	dev_t dev = MKDEV(disk->major, disk->first_minor + p->partno); 
+	return print_dev_t(page, dev);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
