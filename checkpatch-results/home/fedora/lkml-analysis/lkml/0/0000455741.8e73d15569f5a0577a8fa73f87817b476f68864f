The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
