CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <processorCount>
#44: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/prom.c:1080:
+				_systemcfg->processorCount++;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/smp.h:76:
+extern int query_cpu_stopped(unsigned int pcpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
