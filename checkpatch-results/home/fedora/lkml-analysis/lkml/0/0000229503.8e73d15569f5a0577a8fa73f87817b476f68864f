#27: 
does not respond on the PCI bus for a brief period of time when running BIST. 

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern int pci_start_bist(struct pci_dev *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
