Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#397: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/entry_trampoline.c:36:
+	__set_fixmap(FIX_ENTRY_TRAMPOLINE_1, __pa((unsigned long)&__entry_tramp_start) + PAGE_SIZE, prot);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
