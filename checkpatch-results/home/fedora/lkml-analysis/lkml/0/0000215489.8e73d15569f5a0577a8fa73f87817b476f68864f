WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#48: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:76:
+extern unsigned int policydb_loaded_version;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#95: FILE: security/selinux/ss/policydb.c:1187:
 		printk(KERN_ERR "security:  unable to find policy compat info "
+		       "for version %d\n", p->policyvers);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
