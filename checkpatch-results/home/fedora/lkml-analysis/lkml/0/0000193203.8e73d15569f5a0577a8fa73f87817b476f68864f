+config SERIO_I8042_DELAYEDRESPONSEKLUDGE
+	tristate "i8042 delayed response kludge"
+	default n
+	depends on SERIO_I8042
+	---help---
+	  The Toshiba Satellite P10 series has a delayed response on the i8042
+	  device which controls the mouse/keyboard.  Whilst the keyboard can
+	  function without this kludge it is required for the touchpad.  Whilst
+	  the kludge should not break other systems I highly recommend saying N
+	  on all systems but those who suffer this problem.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
