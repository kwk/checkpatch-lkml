ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#38: FILE: include/linux/klist.h:40:
+extern int klist_node_attached(struct klist_node * n);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#38: FILE: include/linux/klist.h:40:
+extern int klist_node_attached(struct klist_node * n);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "n->n_klist"
#64: FILE: lib/klist.c:164:
+	return (n->n_klist != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#67: FILE: lib/klist.c:167:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(klist_node_attached);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
