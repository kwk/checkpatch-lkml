#29: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/generic.c:2:
+ *  linux/drivers/ide/pci/generic.c	Version 0.11	December 30, 2002

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#56: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/generic.c:105:
 static int __devinit generic_init_one(struct pci_dev *dev, const struct pci_device_id *id)

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#68: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/generic.c:123:
+	if(!(command & PCI_COMMAND_IO))
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
