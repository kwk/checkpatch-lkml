#31: 
The attached patch handles TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK as added by David Woodhouse's

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#231: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/signal.c:608:
+			 * clear the TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK flag */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#325: FILE: include/asm-i386/thread_info.h:158:
+#define _TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK	(1<<TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
