ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#40: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:22:
+int pci_msi_quirk = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#49: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:432:
quirk_ioapic_rmw );
