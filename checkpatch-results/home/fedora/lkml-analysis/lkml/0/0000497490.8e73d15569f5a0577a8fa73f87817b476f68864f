ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#42: FILE: fs/proc/inode.c:162:
(S_ISBLK(de->mode)||S_ISCHR(de->mode)||S_ISFIFO(de->mode))

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#47: FILE: fs/proc/inode.c:165:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
