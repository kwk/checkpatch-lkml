ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#44: 
--- a/drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c	Tue Nov  5 11:33:12 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#51: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c:3142:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

#70: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.h:552:
+#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE > KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,44)

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#71: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.h:553:
+static int sbp2scsi_biosparam (struct scsi_device *sdev, struct block_device *dev, sector_t capacity, int geom[]);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
