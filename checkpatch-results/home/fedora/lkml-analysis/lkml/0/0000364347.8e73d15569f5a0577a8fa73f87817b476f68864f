WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#68: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/sc1200.c:80:
+extern int (*sc1200_display_info)(char *, char **, off_t, int); /* ide-proc.c */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char *' should also have an identifier name
#68: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/sc1200.c:80:
+extern int (*sc1200_display_info)(char *, char **, off_t, int); /* ide-proc.c */

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char **' should also have an identifier name

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
