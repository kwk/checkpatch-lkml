WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 139 exceeds 100 columns
#46: FILE: include/linux/bitmap.h:103:
+static void bitmap_and(volatile unsigned long *dst, const volatile unsigned long *bitmap1, const volatile unsigned long *bitmap2, int bits)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
