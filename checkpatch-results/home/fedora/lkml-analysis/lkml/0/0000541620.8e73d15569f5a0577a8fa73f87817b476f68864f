WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#57: FILE: Makefile:384:
+include/linux/config.mak: ./Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#61: FILE: Makefile:388:
+	@echo "EXTRAVERSION	= $(EXTRAVERSION)" >> .mak
 	       ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
