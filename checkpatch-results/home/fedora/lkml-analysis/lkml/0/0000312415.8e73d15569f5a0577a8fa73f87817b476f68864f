Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*dr)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct usb_ctrlrequest)...)
#70: FILE: drivers/usb/usb.c:1201:
+	struct usb_ctrlrequest *dr = kmalloc(sizeof(struct usb_ctrlrequest), GFP_NOIO);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
