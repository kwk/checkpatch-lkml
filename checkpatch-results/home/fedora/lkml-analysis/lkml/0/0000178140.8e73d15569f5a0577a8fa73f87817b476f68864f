#30: 
> Wouldn't it make things more maintainable if (for example) _inb_p() called

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#715: FILE: arch/m32r/kernel/io_opsput.c:2:
+ *  linux/arch/m32r/kernel/io_opsput.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#903: FILE: arch/m32r/kernel/io_usrv.c:91:
+	unsigned char v = _inb(port);
+	delay();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#920: FILE: arch/m32r/kernel/io_usrv.c:98:
+	unsigned short v = _inw(port);
