Well.. I was working on a similar patch too. But, you beat me in sending out

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#100: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/p4-clockmod.c:79:
+		BUG_ON((cpu & ~1) != (smp_processor_id() & ~1));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
