ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#48: 
--- a/kernel/timer.c	Fri Jul 29 22:01:15 2005

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#58: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1459:
+	if (time_interpolator->jitter)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#74: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1475:
+	}
+	else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
