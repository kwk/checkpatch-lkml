Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

+/* FIXME: Old modules.conf claims MATSUSHITA_CDROM2_MAJOR and CDROM3, but
+   AFAICT this doesn't support those majors, so why? --RR 30 Jul 2003 */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
