WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'arch' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#45: FILE: sh/kernel/process.c:121:
+pid_t arch_kernel_thread(int (*fn)(void *), void * arg, unsigned long flags)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
