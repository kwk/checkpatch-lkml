The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#88: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/smp.c:615:
+	return cpu_online(cpu) ? 0 : -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
