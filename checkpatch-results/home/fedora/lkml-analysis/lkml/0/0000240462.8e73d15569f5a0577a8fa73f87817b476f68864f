Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!old_ports"
#83: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1858:
+	if (old_ports == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#270: FILE: include/linux/8250.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated

+ *  $Id: 8250.h,v 1.8 2002/07/21 21:32:30 rmk Exp $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#303: FILE: include/linux/8250.h:34:
+#define UART_CAP_FIFO	(1 << 8)	/* UART has FIFO */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#304: FILE: include/linux/8250.h:35:

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#305: FILE: include/linux/8250.h:36:

CHECK:ARCH_DEFINES: architecture specific defines should be avoided
#324: FILE: include/linux/8250.h:55:
+#if defined(__i386__) && (defined(CONFIG_M386) || defined(CONFIG_M486))

Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever
possible.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
