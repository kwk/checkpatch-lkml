ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#105: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:966:
why are you forcing drive->bios_sect and drive->bios_head

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#108: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:968:
+			drive->bios_sect = drive->sect = 63;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
