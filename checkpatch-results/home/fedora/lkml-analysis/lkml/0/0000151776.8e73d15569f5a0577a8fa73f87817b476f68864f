Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="jbd-2.6.13-mm1-1-invalidatepage.diff"

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#75: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1642:
+	int (*invalidatepage)(struct page *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#75: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1642:
+	int (*invalidatepage)(struct page *, unsigned long);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#76: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1643:
+	int (*invalidatepage)(struct page *, unsigned long);
+	invalidatepage = page->mapping->a_ops->invalidatepage;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!invalidatepage"
#77: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1644:
+	if (invalidatepage == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#113: FILE: mm/truncate.c:16:
+				   do_invalidatepage */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
