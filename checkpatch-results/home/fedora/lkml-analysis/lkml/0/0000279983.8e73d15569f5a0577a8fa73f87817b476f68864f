CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'p' - possible side-effects?
#65: FILE: kernel/sched.c:257:
+# define task_running(rq, p) \
+		((rq)->curr == (p) || spin_is_locked(&(p)->switch_lock))

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#66: FILE: kernel/sched.c:258:
+		((rq)->curr == (p) || spin_is_locked(&(p)->switch_lock))

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
