WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#100: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1174:
+	int cpu;
+	for (cpu = 0; cpu < NR_CPUS; cpu++){

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open brace '{'

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#100: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1174:
+	for (cpu = 0; cpu < NR_CPUS; cpu++){
+		init_timers_cpu(cpu);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
