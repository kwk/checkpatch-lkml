WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#70: FILE: arch/sparc/mm/init.c:64:
+extern unsigned long fix_kmap_begin;	/* calculated in srmmu.c */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#127: FILE: arch/sparc/mm/srmmu.c:333:
+extern unsigned long probe_memory(void);	/* in fault.c */

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#142: FILE: arch/sparc/mm/srmmu.c:348:
+	if (srmmu_nocache_npages > 1280) srmmu_nocache_npages = 1280;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#148: FILE: arch/sparc/mm/srmmu.c:354:
+	fix_kmap_end = fix_kmap_begin + (KM_TYPE_NR * NR_CPUS - 1) * PAGE_SIZE;

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#153: FILE: arch/sparc/mm/srmmu.c:359:
+	/* printk("system memory available = %luk\nnocache ram size = %luk\n",
+		sysmemavail, srmmu_nocache_size / 1024); */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
