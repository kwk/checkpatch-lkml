psmouse.resetafter=3 parameters to your kernel and tell me if it works for you

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#77: 
--- a/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt	Tue Mar 23 01:53:31 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'reports'

+ * psmouse_process_byte() analyzes the PS/2 data stream and reports reports

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'psmouse->type >= PSMOUSE_GENPS'
#135: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:76:
+	if (psmouse->pktcnt < 3 + (psmouse->type >= PSMOUSE_GENPS))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
