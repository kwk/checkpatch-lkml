Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#233: FILE: include/linux/kexec.h:112:
+extern void crash_kexec(int, struct pt_regs *, void *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#233: FILE: include/linux/kexec.h:112:
+extern void crash_kexec(int, struct pt_regs *, void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pt_regs *' should also have an identifier name
#233: FILE: include/linux/kexec.h:112:
+extern void crash_kexec(int, struct pt_regs *, void *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#233: FILE: include/linux/kexec.h:112:
+extern void crash_kexec(int, struct pt_regs *, void *);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#265: FILE: kernel/kexec.c:32:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
