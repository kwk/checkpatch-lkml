CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#102: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:2634:
+				softback_in = softback_curr = p;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
