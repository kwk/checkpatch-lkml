Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#165: FILE: kernel/ntp.c:401:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
