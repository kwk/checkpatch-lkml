specified by the community.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#66: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_rcfs.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#67: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_rcfs.c:2:
+ * kernel/ckrm/ckrm_rcfs.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#129: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_rcfs.c:64:
+static struct config_group *make_rcfs_class(struct config_group *group,
+					const char *name)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*rclass)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct rcfs_class)...)
#136: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_rcfs.c:71:
+	rclass = kzalloc(sizeof(struct rcfs_class), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#225: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_rcfs.c:160:
+MODULE_DESCRIPTION("RCFS - Provides an interface to classes and allows control "
+		   "of their resource usage");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
