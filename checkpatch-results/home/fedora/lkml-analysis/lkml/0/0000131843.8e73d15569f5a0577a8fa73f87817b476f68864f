WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'invokation' may be misspelled - perhaps 'invocation'?
#36: 
__alloc_pages() invokation.
                ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:112:
+extern void drain_local_pages(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#164: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:915:
+	if (order > 0 || (!wait && (gfp_mask & __GFP_HIGH)) ||
+			(p->flags & PF_MEMALLOC))
