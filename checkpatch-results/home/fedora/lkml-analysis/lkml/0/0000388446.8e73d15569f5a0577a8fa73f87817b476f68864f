WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#94: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:60:
+extern unsigned long node_start_pfn[], node_end_pfn[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

+		for (pfn = nmcp->start_pfn; pfn <= nmcp->end_pfn;

+		{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
