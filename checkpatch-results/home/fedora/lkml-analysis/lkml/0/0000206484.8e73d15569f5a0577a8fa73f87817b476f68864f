Here is a patch to fix compile errors of 2.6.11-rc4 for the m32r SMP kernel.

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#103: FILE: include/asm-m32r/spinlock.h:56:
+#define spin_is_locked(x)	(*(volatile int *)(&(x)->slock) <= 0)

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#103: FILE: include/asm-m32r/spinlock.h:56:
+#define spin_is_locked(x)	(*(volatile int *)(&(x)->slock) <= 0)

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
