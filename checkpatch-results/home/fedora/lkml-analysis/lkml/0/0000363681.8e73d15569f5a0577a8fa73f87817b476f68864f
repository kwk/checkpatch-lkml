ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#35: 
--- a/drivers/telephony/ixj.c	Tue Jun 10 11:18:19 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#55: FILE: drivers/telephony/ixj.c:7869:
+	if ((probe = ixj_probe_pci(&cnt)) < 0) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#55: FILE: drivers/telephony/ixj.c:7869:
+	if ((probe = ixj_probe_pci(&cnt)) < 0) {
+		return probe;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
