#23: 
  Added irq-argument to synchronize_irq to make sound/oss/cs46xx.c compile again.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#31: 
--- a/sound/oss/cs46xx.c	Sat Jul 27 17:12:00 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
