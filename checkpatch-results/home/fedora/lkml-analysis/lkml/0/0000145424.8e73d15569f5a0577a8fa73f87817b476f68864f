CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#178: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/suspend.h:15:
+extern int arch_prepare_suspend(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#240: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:331:
+		pud_t *pud = alloc_low_page(&map, &pud_phys);
+		next = start + PGDIR_SIZE;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
