Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#177: FILE: drivers/infiniband/ulp/ipoib/ipoib_fs.c:128:
+static struct seq_operations ipoib_mcg_seq_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#328: FILE: drivers/infiniband/ulp/ipoib/ipoib_fs.c:277:
+	priv->path_dentry = debugfs_create_file(name, S_IFREG | S_IRUGO,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
