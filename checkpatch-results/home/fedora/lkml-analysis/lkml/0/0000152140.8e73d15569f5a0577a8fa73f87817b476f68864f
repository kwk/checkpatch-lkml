WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#55: FILE: drivers/isdn/hisax/sedlbauer_cs.c:614:
+	PCMCIA_DEVICE_PROD_ID123("SEDLBAUER", "speed star II", "V 3.1", 0x81fb79f5, 0xf3612e1d, 0x6b95c78a),

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
