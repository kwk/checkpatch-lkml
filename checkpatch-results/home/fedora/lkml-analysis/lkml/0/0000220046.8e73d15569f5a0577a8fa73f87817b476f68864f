# This is a BitKeeper generated diff -Nru style patch.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#55: 
--- a/scripts/kconfig/mconf.c	2004-12-31 00:46:29 +01:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#73: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:742:
+		struct gstr str = str_init();
+		str_printf(&str, "CONFIG_%s:\n\n%s", sym->name, help);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
