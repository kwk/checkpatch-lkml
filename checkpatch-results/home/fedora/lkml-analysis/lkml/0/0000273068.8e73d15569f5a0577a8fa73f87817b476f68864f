WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'is'
#49: 
Again, this is is kinda of crude, but I would really like to see

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#59: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:54:
#include <linux/pci.h>

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'stuct' may be misspelled - perhaps 'struct'?
#80: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:2923:
+/* A stuct to help with resource allocation enumeration */
      ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#82: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:2925:
+struct parport_pc_resources
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#89: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:2932:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#93: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:2935:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
