#23: 
_PAGE_FILE does not indicate whether a file is in page / swap cache, it is set

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'clearify' may be misspelled - perhaps 'clarify'?
#25: 
clearify _PAGE_NONE.
^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
