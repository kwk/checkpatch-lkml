CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:98:
+extern void *kcalloc(size_t, size_t, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#69: FILE: mm/slab.c:2346:
+	void *ret = kmalloc(n * size, flags);
+	if (ret)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#74: FILE: mm/slab.c:2351:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(kcalloc);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
