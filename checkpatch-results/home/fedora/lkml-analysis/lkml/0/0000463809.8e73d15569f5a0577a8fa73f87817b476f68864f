ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#56: 
--- a/Documentation/sonypi.txt	Wed Apr 17 16:14:01 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#107: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:321:
+^I^Isonypi_pkey_ev = nojogdial ? SONYPI_TYPE2_PKEY_EV $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#131: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:721:

+	       "camera = %s, compat = %s, nojogdial = %s\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
