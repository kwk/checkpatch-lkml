#36: 
That's good, but I see that you didn't add the call to class_device_rename()

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#48: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2351:
+^I^I^Iif (err) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#49: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2352:
+				printk(KERN_DEBUG "SIOCSIFNAME: error renaming class_device (%d)\n", err);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
