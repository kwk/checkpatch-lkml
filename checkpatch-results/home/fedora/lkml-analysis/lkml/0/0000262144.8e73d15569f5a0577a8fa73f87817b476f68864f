CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#133: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:969:
+extern void cond_resched(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#210: FILE: fs/inode.c:299:
+static int invalidate_list(struct list_head *head, struct list_head *dispose, struct list_head *mark)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#230: FILE: fs/inode.c:321:
+			tmp = next = mark->next;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#242: FILE: fs/inode.c:366:
+	marker = kmalloc(sizeof(*marker), GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_REPEAT);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#304: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3470:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(cond_resched);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#317: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3483:
+int __sched cond_resched_lock(spinlock_t * lock)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
