#26: 
1. the function in the ppc 8260 ethernet driver that's suppose to put the interface into promiscuous or multicast modes contains a 'return' statement immediately at the beginning. this prevents running an 8260-based system as a bridge for example. the 'return' statement is not indented, and there's no comment to explain it. it is unclear if it was forgotten there by the writer or whether it serves some functional role (improve performance for other modes of operations, cover up for untested code later, etc.). removing it does not seem to hurt the operation of the system though. unless there's a known use for this 'return', i would like to suggest the following patch (demonstrated here for 2.4.22):
