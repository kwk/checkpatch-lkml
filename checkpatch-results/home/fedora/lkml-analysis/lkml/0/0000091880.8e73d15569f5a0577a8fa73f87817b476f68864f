#319: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_int.h:275:
+	int (*ioctl) (struct dasd_device *, unsigned int, void __user *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
