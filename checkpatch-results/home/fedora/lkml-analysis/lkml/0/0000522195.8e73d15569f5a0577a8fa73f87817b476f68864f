Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#104: FILE: net/ipv4/icmp.c:242:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
