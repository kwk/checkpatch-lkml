To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#345: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/suspend.c:132:

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#393: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/suspend_asm.S:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
