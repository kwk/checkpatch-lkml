I've replaced one `echo -e' with `printf', because, for example, my shell is

./tmp.EfiDkiSq0Q//home/fedora/lkml-analysis/lkml/0/patch.offset.0000023262.commit.8e73d15569f5a0577a8fa73f87817b476f68864f total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 0 checks, 99 lines checked

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
