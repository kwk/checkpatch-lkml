ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#29: 
--- a/drivers/char/random.c	2002-08-17 19:55:31.000000000 -0500

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#39: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:599:
+static __u32 *batch_entropy_pool=0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

#48: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:607:

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#58: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:611:
+	batch_pos = batch_credit = batch_samples = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
