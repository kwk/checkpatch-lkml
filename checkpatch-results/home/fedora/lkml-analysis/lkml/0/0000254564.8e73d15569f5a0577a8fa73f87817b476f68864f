CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "child->signal"
#52: FILE: kernel/ptrace.c:85:
+	    child->signal != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#55: FILE: kernel/ptrace.c:88:
+		if (child->state == TASK_STOPPED) {
[...]
+		} else if (child->state != TASK_TRACED && !kill) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
