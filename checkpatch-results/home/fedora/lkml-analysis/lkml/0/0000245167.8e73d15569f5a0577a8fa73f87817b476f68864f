WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#347: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/irq.c:98:
+	unsigned irq = regs->orig_rax & 0xff;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#410: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/irq.c:101:
+	BUG_ON(irq > 256);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#985: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/hardirq.h:25:
