Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#66: FILE: net/packet/af_packet.c:332:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#74: FILE: net/packet/af_packet.c:335:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
