ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#100: FILE: include/linux/usb.h:280:
+extern struct usb_interface *usb_find_interface(struct usb_driver *drv, kdev_t kdev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
