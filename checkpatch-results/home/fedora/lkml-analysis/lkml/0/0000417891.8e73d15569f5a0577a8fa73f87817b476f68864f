#25: 
This is take 2 of the updated patch against 2.5.45. I'm asking the compiler 

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#44: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ioport.c:113:
+	volatile struct pt_regs * regs = (struct pt_regs *) &unused;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#44: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ioport.c:113:
+	volatile struct pt_regs * regs = (struct pt_regs *) &unused;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#44: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ioport.c:113:
+	volatile struct pt_regs * regs = (struct pt_regs *) &unused;
