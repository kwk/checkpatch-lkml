The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#53: FILE: arch/um/kernel/trap_kern.c:46:
+	if (in_atomic())

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.
