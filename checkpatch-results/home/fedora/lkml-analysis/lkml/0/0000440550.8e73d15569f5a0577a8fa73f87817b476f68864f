Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#130: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1302:
+	BUG_ON(irqs_disabled());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#215: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1443:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#224: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1452:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
