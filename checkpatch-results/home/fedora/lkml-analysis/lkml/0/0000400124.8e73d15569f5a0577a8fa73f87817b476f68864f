We did have all of this running, but I never submitted the patch for reasons

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ptr"
#115: FILE: init/main.c:335:
+	if (ptr == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#128: FILE: init/main.c:348:
