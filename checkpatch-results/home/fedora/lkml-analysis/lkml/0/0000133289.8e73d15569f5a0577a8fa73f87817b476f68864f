Subject: [PATCH] fix bug in sn/ia64 for sparse CPU numbering

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#48: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/sn2/sn_hwperf.c:753:
+					cpuobj = (struct sn_hwperf_object_info *) p + cpuobj_index++;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#48: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/sn2/sn_hwperf.c:753:
+					cpuobj = (struct sn_hwperf_object_info *) p + cpuobj_index++;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
