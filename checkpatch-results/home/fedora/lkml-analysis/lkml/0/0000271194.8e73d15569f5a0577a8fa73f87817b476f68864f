#59: 
USB: fix bug where removing usb-serial modules or usb serial devices could oops

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#77: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/generic.c:58:
+ * depending on the command line argument */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#84: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/generic.c:65:
+static int generic_probe(struct usb_interface *interface,
+			       const struct usb_device_id *id)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "id_pattern"
#89: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/generic.c:70:
+	if (id_pattern != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
