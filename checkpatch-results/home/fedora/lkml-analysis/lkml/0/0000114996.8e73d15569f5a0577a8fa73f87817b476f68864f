CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#41: FILE: include/linux/kallsyms.h:23:
+extern int __print_symbol(const char *fmt, unsigned long address);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#89: FILE: kernel/kallsyms.c:254:
+	return printk(fmt, buffer);
