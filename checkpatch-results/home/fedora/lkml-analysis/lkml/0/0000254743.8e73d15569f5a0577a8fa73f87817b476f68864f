Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever
possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#135: FILE: sound/core/pcm_native.c:3023:
+static struct page *snd_pcm_mmap_data_nopage(struct vm_area_struct *area, unsigned long address, int *type)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
