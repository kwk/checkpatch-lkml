#34: 
Following patch removes the union and any references to it. Applies to 2.6.9.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#50: FILE: fs/cifs/dir.c:202:
+		if ((nd->open.flags & O_ACCMODE) == O_RDONLY)
[...]
-		else if ((nd->intent.open.flags & O_ACCMODE) == O_WRONLY) {
[...]
 			write_only = TRUE;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#204: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c:784:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
