ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#75: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/mtrr.h:73:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#76: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/mtrr.h:74:
+static char *mtrr_strings[MTRR_NUM_TYPES] =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
