In message <Pine.LNX.4.44.0310011216530.24564-100000@home.osdl.org> you write:

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#246: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/systbls.S:38:
+/*80*/	.word compat_setgroups16, sys_getpgrp, sys_setgroups, compat_sys_setitimer, sys32_ftruncate64

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
