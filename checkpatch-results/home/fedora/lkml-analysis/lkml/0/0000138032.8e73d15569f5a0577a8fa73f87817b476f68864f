WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#64: 
#define MAX_NR_ZONES            3       /* Sync this with ZONES_SHIFT */

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#126: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:170:
+extern int create_mem_file(unsigned long long len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
