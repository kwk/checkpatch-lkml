This is a mininal fix, really only serving as a reminder, that this

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#56: FILE: fs/namespace.c:874:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'Hack'
#57: FILE: fs/namespace.c:875:
+		/* Hack hack.  Need to get reference to namespace

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#58: FILE: fs/namespace.c:876:
+		/* Hack hack.  Need to get reference to namespace
+		   while ensuring that count is not already zero.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
