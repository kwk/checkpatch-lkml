WARNING:UNNECESSARY_INT: Prefer 'unsigned long long' over 'unsigned long long int' as the int is unnecessary

+	unsigned long long int x, y;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#112: FILE: src/measure.c:39:
+	unsigned long long int x, y;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
