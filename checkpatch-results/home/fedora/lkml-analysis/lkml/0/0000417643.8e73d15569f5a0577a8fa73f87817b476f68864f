WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#49: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/longhaul.c:439:
+		   Assume min=3D3.0x & max =3D whatever we booted at. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
