#25: 
Ugly trick to help make malloc not sleeping - we can't do anything else. But

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: arch/um/include/kern_util.h:115:
+extern int __cant_sleep(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: arch/um/include/user.h:21:
+extern void *um_vmalloc_atomic(int size);

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#77: FILE: arch/um/kernel/helper.c:64:
+	else stack = alloc_stack(0, __cant_sleep());

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'contiguos' may be misspelled - perhaps 'contiguous'?
#103: FILE: arch/um/kernel/main.c:202:
+	else if (size <= PAGE_SIZE) /* finding contiguos pages can be hard*/
 	                                       ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#140: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process_kern.c:308:
+int __cant_sleep(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#141: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process_kern.c:309:
+	return in_atomic() || irqs_disabled() || in_interrupt();

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.
