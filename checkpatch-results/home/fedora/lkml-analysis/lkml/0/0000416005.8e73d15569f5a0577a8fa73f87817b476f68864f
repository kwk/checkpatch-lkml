ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#39: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:21:
+long    htlbpagemem = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:SSCANF_TO_KSTRTO: Prefer kstrto<type> to single variable sscanf
#58: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:518:
+	if (sscanf(s, "%d", &htlbpage_max) <= 0)
+		htlbpage_max = 0;

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#62: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:522:
+__setup("hugepages=", hugetlb_setup);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#79: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:539:
+	htlbpage_max = htlbpagemem = htlbzone_pages = i;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#80: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:540:
+	printk("Total HugeTLB memory allocated, %ld\n", htlbpagemem);
