Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#108: FILE: drivers/misc/ibmasm/command.c:34:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#116: FILE: drivers/misc/ibmasm/command.c:42:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

+	  This option enables device driver support for in-band access to the
+	  IBM RSA (Condor) service processor in eServer xSeries systems.
+	  The ibmasm device driver allows user space application to access
+	  ASM (Advanced Systems Management) functions on the service
+	  processor. The driver is meant to be used in conjunction with
+	  a user space API.
+	  The ibmasm driver also enables the OS to use the UART on the
+          service processor board as a regular serial port.
+	  
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
