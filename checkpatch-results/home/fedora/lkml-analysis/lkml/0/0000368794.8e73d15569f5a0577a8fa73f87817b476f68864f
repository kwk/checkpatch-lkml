ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#61: 
--- a/include/linux/timex.h	Tue May 20 00:03:28 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#83: FILE: include/linux/timex.h:321:
+	void (*update) (long);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'long' should also have an identifier name
#83: FILE: include/linux/timex.h:321:
+	void (*update) (long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
