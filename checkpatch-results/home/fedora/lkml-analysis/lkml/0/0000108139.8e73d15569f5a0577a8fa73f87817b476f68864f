CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#122: FILE: include/linux/mempolicy.h:150:
+extern void mpol_set_task_struct_flag(struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#165: FILE: mm/slab.c:2707:
+	if (unlikely(current->flags & (PF_MEM_SPREAD|PF_MEMPOLICY)))
 	                                            ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#166: FILE: mm/slab.c:2708:
+		if ((objp = alternate_node_alloc(cachep, flags)) != NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#183: FILE: mm/slab.c:2752:
+	nid_alloc = nid_here = numa_node_id();

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
