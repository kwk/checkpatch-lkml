CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#78: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:709:
+	dir->i_ctime = dir->i_mtime = dir->i_atime = *ts;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
