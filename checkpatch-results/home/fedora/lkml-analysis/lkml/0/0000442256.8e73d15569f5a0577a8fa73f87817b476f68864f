WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#38: FILE: drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_misc.c:875:
+	MINFO->limits.system.vcomax	= (bd->pins[ 36] == 0xFF) ? MINFO->limits.pixel.vcomax	: bd->pins[ 36] * mult;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
