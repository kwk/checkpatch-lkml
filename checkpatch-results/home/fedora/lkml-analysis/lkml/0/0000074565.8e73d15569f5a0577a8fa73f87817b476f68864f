#27: 
I need a little assistance to isolate the cause of the following problem.  Any assistance offered would be greatly appreciated.  I can rebuild, reconfigure, and jump through hoops as required to get useful debugging information.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'reseting' may be misspelled - perhaps 'resetting'?
#52: 
The system stays in the hung state until I power up a machine on the internal network and make a DHCP request.  The affected firewall machine then wakes from its sleep and continues normal operation.  During the hang period the system clock has stopped ticking i.e. system time is now wrong and ntpd shuts down.  The hangcheck_timer (default settings) and "Detect Soft Lockup" do not trigger.  The kernel log sometimes records "tulip_stop_rxtx() failed"  and/or "wifi0: hardware error; reseting" if madwifi is loaded.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ^^^^^^^^
