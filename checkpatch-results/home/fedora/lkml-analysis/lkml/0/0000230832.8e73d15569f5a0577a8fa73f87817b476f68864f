Andrea posted this one-liner a while ago as part of a larger patch.  He said

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#38: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:905:
+               } else if (end <= p->start) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
