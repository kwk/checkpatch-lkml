CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:164:
+extern unsigned long get_active_limit(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#87: FILE: mm/clockpro.c:107:
+	struct zone * zone;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
