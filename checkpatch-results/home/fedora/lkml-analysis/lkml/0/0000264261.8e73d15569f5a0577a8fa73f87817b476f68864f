ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#44: 
--- a/kernel/power/Kconfig	2004-08-01 21:32:06 -07:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#50: FILE: kernel/power/Kconfig:21:
+config PM_DEBUG
+	bool "Power Management Debug Support"
+	---help---
+	This option enables verbose debugging support in the Power Management
+	code. This is helpful when debugging and reporting various PM bugs,
+	like suspend support.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_VARIABLE: Use of EXTRA_CFLAGS is deprecated, please use `ccflags-y instead.
#66: FILE: kernel/power/Makefile:3:
+EXTRA_CFLAGS	+=	-DDEBUG

EXTRA_{A,C,CPP,LD}FLAGS are deprecated and should be replaced by the new
flags added via commit f77bf01425b1 ("kbuild: introduce ccflags-y,
asflags-y and ldflags-y").

The following conversion scheme maybe used::

  EXTRA_AFLAGS    ->  asflags-y
  EXTRA_CFLAGS    ->  ccflags-y
  EXTRA_CPPFLAGS  ->  cppflags-y
  EXTRA_LDFLAGS   ->  ldflags-y
