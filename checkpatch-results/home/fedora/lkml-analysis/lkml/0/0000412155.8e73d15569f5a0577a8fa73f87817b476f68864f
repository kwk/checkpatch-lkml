Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
