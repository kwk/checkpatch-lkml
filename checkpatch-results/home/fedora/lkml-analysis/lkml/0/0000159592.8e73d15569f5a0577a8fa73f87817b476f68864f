CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#94: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:458:
+	extern void sighand_free_cb(struct rcu_head *rhp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#154: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1160:
+	if (!ret && sig && (sp = p->sighand)) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
