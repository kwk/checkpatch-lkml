WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#63: FILE: drivers/xen/util.c:1:
+#include <linux/config.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#68: FILE: drivers/xen/util.c:6:
+#include <asm/uaccess.h>

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!area"
#82: FILE: drivers/xen/util.c:20:
+	if (area == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#102: FILE: drivers/xen/util.c:40:
+	struct vm_struct *ret;
+	ret = remove_vm_area(area->addr);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#103: FILE: drivers/xen/util.c:41:
+	BUG_ON(ret != area);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#144: FILE: include/xen/driver_util.h:9:
+extern struct vm_struct *alloc_vm_area(unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
