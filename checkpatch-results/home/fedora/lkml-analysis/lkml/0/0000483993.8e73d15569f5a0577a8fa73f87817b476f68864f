WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#84: FILE: include/asm-i386/smplock.h:23:
+			BUG();			\

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:NEW_TYPEDEFS: do not add new typedefs
#95: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:139:
+typedef struct task_struct task_t;

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#99: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:143:
+extern void idle_startup_done(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after wait_init_idle
#127: FILE: init/main.c:306:
+static unsigned long __initdata wait_init_idle;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
