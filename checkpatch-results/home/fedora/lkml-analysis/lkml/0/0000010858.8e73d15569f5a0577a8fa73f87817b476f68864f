Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*new)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct sem_undo)...)
#63: FILE: ipc/sem.c:1073:
+       new = kzalloc(sizeof(struct sem_undo) + sizeof(short)*nsems, GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
