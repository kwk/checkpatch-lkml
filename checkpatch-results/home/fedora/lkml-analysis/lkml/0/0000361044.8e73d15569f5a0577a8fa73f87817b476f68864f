WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#138: FILE: kernel/sched.c:322:
+	bonus = MAX_USER_PRIO*PRIO_BONUS_RATIO*(p->best_sleep_avg/BEST_SLEEP_DECAY)/MAX_SLEEP_AVG/100 -

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
