CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dev)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct dio_dev)...)
#39: FILE: drivers/dio/dio.c:227:
+		dev = kzalloc(sizeof(struct dio_dev), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
