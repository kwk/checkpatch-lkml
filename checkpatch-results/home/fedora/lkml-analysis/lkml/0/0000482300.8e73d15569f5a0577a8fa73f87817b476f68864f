ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#42: 
--- a/drivers/usb/usb.c	Wed Jan 23 13:20:28 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#63: FILE: drivers/usb/usb.c:2531:
+	if (!(port = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#98: FILE: drivers/usb/usb.c:2808:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(usb_make_path);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#108: FILE: include/linux/usb.h:884:
+extern int usb_make_path(struct usb_device *dev, char *buf, size_t size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
