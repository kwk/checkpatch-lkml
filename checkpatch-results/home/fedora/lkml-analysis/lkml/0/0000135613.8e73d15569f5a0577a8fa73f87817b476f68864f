#26: 
fid is declared as a u32 (unsigned int), and then a few lines later, it is checked for a value < 0, which is clearly useless.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#45: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/airo.c:2043:
+static void get_tx_error(struct airo_info *ai, s32 fid)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
