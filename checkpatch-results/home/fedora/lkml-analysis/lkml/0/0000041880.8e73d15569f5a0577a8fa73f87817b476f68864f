#76: 
 Pp: a potential volatile, preserved page. There are two cases for page out:

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#149: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/traps.c:68:
+extern pgm_check_handler_t do_discard_fault;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#178: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:35:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#194: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:528:
+__setup("nocmm2", nocmm2);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#203: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:537:
+	if (virt_to_phys((void *) kaddr) != address)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#237: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:571:
+		switch (*(unsigned char *) regs->psw.addr) {

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#354: FILE: include/asm-s390/pgtable.h:617:
+	unsigned long __physpage = __pa((__page-mem_map) << PAGE_SHIFT);  \
 	                                       ^

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#396: FILE: mm/rmap.c:598:
+			BUG_ON(!page_make_stable(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
