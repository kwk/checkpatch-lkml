ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#40: 
--- a/kernel/power/pmdisk.c	2004-07-17 14:51:48 -07:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

+extern unsigned short swapfile_used[MAX_SWAPFILES];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Do not use assignments in if condition.

should be written as::
