WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#181: FILE: mm/shmem.c:172:
+static struct vm_operations_struct shmem_zero_vm_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#198: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1108:
+		struct shmem_inode_info *info = SHMEM_I(inode);
+		if (shmem_acct_size(info->flags, vm_size - i_size))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#204: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1114:
+		if (vm_size <= SHMEM_MAX_BYTES) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#207: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1117:
+			inode->i_ctime = inode->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#209: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1119:
+		} else
