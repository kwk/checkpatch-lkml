CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#80: FILE: usb/storage/transport.c:1077:
+		    us->pusb_dev->descriptor.idProduct == 0x2003) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#82: FILE: usb/storage/transport.c:1079:
+			/* This device will send bcs->Status == 0x8a for unused targets and
+			   == 0x02 for SRB's that require SENSE. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting
