# This is a BitKeeper generated diff -Nru style patch.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#48: 
--- a/arch/ppc/syslib/mpc52xx_setup.c   2004-09-14 12:47:30 +02:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#54: FILE: arch/ppc/syslib/mpc52xx_setup.c:26:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
