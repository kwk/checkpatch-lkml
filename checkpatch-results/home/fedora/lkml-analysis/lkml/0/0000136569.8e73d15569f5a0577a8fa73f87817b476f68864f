CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*buf)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct rchan_buf)...)
#44: FILE: fs/relayfs/buffers.c:136:
+	struct rchan_buf *buf = kzalloc(sizeof(struct rchan_buf), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
