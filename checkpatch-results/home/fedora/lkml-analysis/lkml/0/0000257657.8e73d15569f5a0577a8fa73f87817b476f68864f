Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#140: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-ixp2000.c:60:
+		while(!gpio_line_get(ixp2000_scl_pin(data)) && i--);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#148: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-ixp2000.c:68:
+	if (val) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
