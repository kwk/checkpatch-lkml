WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#35: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .2
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#65: FILE: arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_ioctl.c:42:
+^Iret = put_user(new_encode_dev(tty_devnum(real_tty)), ptr); $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 125 exceeds 100 columns
#81: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/cmd64x.c:611:
+		pci_write_config_dword(dev, PCI_ROM_ADDRESS, dev->resource[PCI_ROM_RESOURCE].start | PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#94: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt34x.c:177:

 				dev->resource[PCI_ROM_RESOURCE].start | PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE);

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#101: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1334:
 static unsigned int __devinit init_chipset_hpt366(struct pci_dev *dev, const char *name)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#113: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1344:
+		pci_write_config_dword(dev, PCI_ROM_ADDRESS,
 			dev->resource[PCI_ROM_RESOURCE].start | PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#124: FILE: drivers/net/forcedeth.c:1892:
+	 * to init hw */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 24)

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <diFree>
#315: FILE: fs/jfs/inode.c:137:
+		diFree(inode);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#341: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:337:
+			unsigned long endvma = vma->vm_end; 
+			if (endvma > end)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
