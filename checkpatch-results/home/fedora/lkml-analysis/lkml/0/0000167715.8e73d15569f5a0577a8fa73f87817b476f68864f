The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#53: FILE: drivers/pci/bus/pci-bridge.c:21:
+static struct pci_bus * ppb_create_bus(struct pci_dev *dev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#124: FILE: drivers/pci/bus/pci-bridge.c:92:
+	bus->number = bus->secondary = busnr;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
