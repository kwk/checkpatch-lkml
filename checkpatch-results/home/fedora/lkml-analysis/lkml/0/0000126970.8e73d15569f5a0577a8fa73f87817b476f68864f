CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#123: FILE: include/linux/kprobes.h:161:
+extern void inc_nmissed_count(struct kprobe *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#139: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:253:
+	struct kprobe *kp;
+	if (p->pre_handler != aggr_pre_handler) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
#146: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:260:
+	return;
