WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'do_cdu31a_request', this function's name, in a string
#84: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdu31a.c:1378:
+		printk("Leaving do_cdu31a_request at %d\n", __LINE__);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
