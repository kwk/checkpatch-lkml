WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#178: FILE: kernel/mutex.c:2:
+ * kernel/mutex.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#335: FILE: kernel/mutex.c:159:
+			TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, add_to_head __IP__)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
