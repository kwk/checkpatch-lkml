WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#94: FILE: kernel/timer.c:238:
+			 * and lock_timer_base checks ->base != 0. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#117: FILE: kernel/timer.c:412:
+		BUG_ON(tmp->base != &base->t_base);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
