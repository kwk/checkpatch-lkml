WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#43: FILE: fs/relayfs/inode.c:36:
+struct file_operations relayfs_file_operations;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
