CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#101: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:256:
+extern void kobject_fork(struct kobject *, pid_t, pid_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
