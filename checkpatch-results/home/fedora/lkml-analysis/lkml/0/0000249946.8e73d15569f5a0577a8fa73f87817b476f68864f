CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#37: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:169:
+extern unsigned long long os_usecs(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#147: FILE: arch/um/kernel/time_kern.c:71:
+		if(delta < 0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
