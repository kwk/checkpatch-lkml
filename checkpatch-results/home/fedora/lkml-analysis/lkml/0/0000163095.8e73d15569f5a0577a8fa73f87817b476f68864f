Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#121: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1209:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#133: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1221:
+	if (!nodes_empty(nodes)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#138: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1226:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
