WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#77: FILE: ptrace.c:61:
+			if (child->signal->flags & SIGNAL_STOP_STOPPED) {
[...]
+			} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#152: FILE: linux/ptrace.h:83:
+extern int ptrace_attach_jail(struct task_struct *tsk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
