WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#188: FILE: drivers/atm/firestream.c:954:
+		   successfully. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 126 exceeds 100 columns
#428: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c:1026:
+						"verify, page 0x%08x, " "%6i bytes were successful\n", __FUNCTION__, page, i);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

#595: FILE: drivers/scsi/advansys.c:12377:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
