CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#129: FILE: drivers/input/misc/uinput.c:278:
+	dev->name = name = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
