The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
