#27: 
Small patch for the latest nvidia nforce 1.0-261 nvnet drivers with kernel 2.5.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#87: FILE: nvnet/nvnet.c:30:
+char* aPhyAddrAndId[256] = {};

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
