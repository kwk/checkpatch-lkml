#28: 
After doing a fairly extensive scan of the 2.4.18 source code, I notice that

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#49: FILE: include/linux/capability.h:94:
+/* Overrides the following restrictions that:
+   the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits will be turned off when a file is modified;

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting
