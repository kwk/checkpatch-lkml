WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'developpers' may be misspelled - perhaps 'developers'?
#30: 
Driver developpers should set pci_driver.driver.name, while
       ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_driver *' should also have an identifier name
#64: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:866:
+int __pci_register_driver(struct pci_driver *, struct module *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct module *' should also have an identifier name

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#102: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:344:
+		 * use pci_driver.driver.name instead of pci_driver.name */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#157: FILE: drivers/ide/setup-pci.c:814:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(__ide_pci_register_driver);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#169: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1327:
+extern int __ide_pci_register_driver(struct pci_driver *driver, struct module *owner);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
