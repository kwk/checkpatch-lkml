#63: FILE: include/asm-i386/thread_info.h:109:
+	if (offset == 0 || offset > (THREAD_SIZE-sizeof(void*)))

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
