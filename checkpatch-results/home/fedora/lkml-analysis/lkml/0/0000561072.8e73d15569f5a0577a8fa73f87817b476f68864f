Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#60: FILE: fs/proc/proc_tty.c:184:
+static struct inode_operations proc_cons_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
