Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#885: FILE: kernel/extable.c:16:
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#895: FILE: kernel/extable.c:24:
+extern struct exception_table_entry __stop___ex_table[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#931: FILE: kernel/module.c:1637:
+  ^I/* Set up and sort exception table */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#931: FILE: kernel/module.c:1637:
+  ^I/* Set up and sort exception table */$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#931: FILE: kernel/module.c:1637:
+  ^I/* Set up and sort exception table */$

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#933: FILE: kernel/module.c:1639:
+	mod->extable = extable = (void *)sechdrs[exindex].sh_addr;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#955: FILE: lib/extable.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#956: FILE: lib/extable.c:2:
+ * lib/extable.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
