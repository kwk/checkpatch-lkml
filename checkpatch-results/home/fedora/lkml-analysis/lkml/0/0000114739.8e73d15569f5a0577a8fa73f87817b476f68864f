ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#190: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:1638:
+static int make_request(request_queue_t *q, struct bio * bi)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <MaxSector>
#209: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:1668:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#209: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:1668:
+		if (conf->expand_progress == MaxSector)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
