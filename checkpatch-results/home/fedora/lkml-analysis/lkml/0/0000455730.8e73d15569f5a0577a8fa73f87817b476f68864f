WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#64: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:539:
+	current->flags |= PF_IOTHREAD;	/* loop can be used in an encrypted device
+					   hence, it mustn't be stopped at all because it could

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#113: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:2:
+ * linux/kernel/suspend.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#147: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:863:

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#147: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:863:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#150: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:866:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'noone' may be misspelled - perhaps 'no one'?
#154: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:870:

 		              ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '==' (ctx:VxV)

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 118 exceeds 100 columns
#159: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:875:
+			do_magic(0);			/* This function returns after machine woken up from resume */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
