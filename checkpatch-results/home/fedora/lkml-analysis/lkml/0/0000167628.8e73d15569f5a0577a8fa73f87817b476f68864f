#28: 
I would like to get some feedback on this patch for the kernel.  It's sole purpose is to help in reducing boot time by not waiting to synchronize the clock edge with the hardware clock. This when combined with other boot reduction patched can bring the kernel boot time to well under 10 seconds, in most cases two or three seconds.  In a desktop system this patch is probably insignificant, howerver several patches like this in a set top box or cell phone will be signicant.
