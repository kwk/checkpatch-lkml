WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#130: FILE: include/asm-ia64/hw_irq.h:62:
+#define IA64_MAX_DEVICE_VECTORS		(IA64_DEF_LAST_DEVICE_VECTOR - IA64_DEF_FIRST_DEVICE_VECTOR + 1)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#138: FILE: include/asm-ia64/hw_irq.h:96:
+extern int reserve_irq_vector (int vector);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
