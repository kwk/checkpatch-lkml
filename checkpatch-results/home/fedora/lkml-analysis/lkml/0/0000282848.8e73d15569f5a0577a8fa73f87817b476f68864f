   In particular, a read/write of x bytes where x % 4 != 0 will loop forever.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#144: 
--- a/sound/oss/i810_audio.c	Tue May 11 04:14:27 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'port' - possible side-effects?
#181: FILE: sound/oss/i810_audio.c:503:

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct i810_state *' should also have an identifier name
#236: FILE: sound/oss/i810_audio.c:1083:
+	void (*start)(struct i810_state *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#416: FILE: sound/oss/i810_audio.c:1267:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#466: FILE: sound/oss/i810_audio.c:1301:
+                if (signal_pending(current) && signals_allowed) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+                        break;
+                }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
