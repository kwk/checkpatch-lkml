CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#43: FILE: arch/um/include/registers.h:18:
+extern void get_thread_regs(union uml_pt_regs *uml_regs, void *buffer);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#176: FILE: arch/um/sys-i386/sysrq.c:91:
+		ebp = (unsigned long) KSTK_EBP(task);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'tsk' may be better as '(tsk)' to avoid precedence issues
#217: FILE: include/asm-um/processor-generic.h:142:
+#define KSTK_REG(tsk, reg) \
+	({ union uml_pt_regs regs; \
+	   get_thread_regs(&regs, tsk->thread.mode.skas.switch_buf); \
+	   UPT_REG(&regs, reg); })
