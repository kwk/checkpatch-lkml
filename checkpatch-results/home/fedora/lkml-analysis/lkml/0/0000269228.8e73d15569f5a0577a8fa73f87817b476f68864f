CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev"
#65: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_osm.c:4209:
+	if (dev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#69: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_osm.c:4213:
+	if (spin_is_locked(&ahd->platform_data->spin_lock))

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/locking/lockdep-design.html#annotations

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ahd_linux_next_device_to_run"
