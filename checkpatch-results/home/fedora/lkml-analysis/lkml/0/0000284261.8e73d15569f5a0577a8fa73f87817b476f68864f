CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <i91uVersion>
#124: FILE: drivers/scsi/ini9100u.c:167:
+char *i91uVersion = "v1.04a";

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#132: FILE: drivers/scsi/ini9100u.c:556:
+int i91u_bus_reset(Scsi_Cmnd * SCpnt)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#151: FILE: drivers/scsi/ini9100u.h:85:
+extern int i91u_bus_reset(Scsi_Cmnd *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'Scsi_Cmnd *' should also have an identifier name
#151: FILE: drivers/scsi/ini9100u.h:85:
+extern int i91u_bus_reset(Scsi_Cmnd *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
