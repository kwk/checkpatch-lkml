WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#115: FILE: fs/ntfs/super.c:1186:

 			^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#121: FILE: fs/ntfs/super.c:1192:
+	vol->attrdef = (ATTR_DEF*)ntfs_malloc_nofs(ino->i_size);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
