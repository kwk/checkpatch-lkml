WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'suspend', this function's name, in a string
#127: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:1148:
+		printk(KERN_CRIT "apm: suspend was vetoed, but suspending anyway.\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#254: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:1289:

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#271: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:1459:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
