WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#80: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:330:
+	extern int use_cyclone;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#81: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:331:
+	extern int use_cyclone;
+	if (use_cyclone == 0) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#83: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:333:
+		static const char s[] __initdata = "Not an IBM x440/NUMAQ. Don't use i386 CONFIG_NUMA anywhere else."

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of const init definition must use __initconst
#83: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:333:
+		static const char s[] __initdata = "Not an IBM x440/NUMAQ. Don't use i386 CONFIG_NUMA anywhere else."

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#84: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:334:

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I^Ipanic(s); $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
