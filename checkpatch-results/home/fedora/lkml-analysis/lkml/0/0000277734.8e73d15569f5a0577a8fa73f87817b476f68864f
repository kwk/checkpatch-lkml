WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#48: 
######################################

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'drivers' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#59: FILE: usb/storage/unusual_devs.h:413:
+ * Some EagleTec devices don't work with the other entry for EagleTec. $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

slight adjustment.

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#63: FILE: usb/storage/unusual_devs.h:416:
+ * That is the only reason this entry is needed.
+*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
