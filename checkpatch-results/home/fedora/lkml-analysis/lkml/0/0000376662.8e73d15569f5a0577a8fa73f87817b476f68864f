--- a/fs/nfsd/nfs4proc.c	Sun Apr 20 12:59:32 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct svc_rqst *' should also have an identifier name
#41: FILE: include/linux/nfsd/xdr4.h:347:
+int nfsd4_setclientid_confirm(struct svc_rqst *, struct nfsd4_setclientid_confirm *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
