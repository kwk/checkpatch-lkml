ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#34: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:612:
+int dont_enable_local_apic __initdata = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
