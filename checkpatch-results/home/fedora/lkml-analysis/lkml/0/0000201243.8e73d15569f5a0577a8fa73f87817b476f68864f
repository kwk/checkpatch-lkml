CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#168: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:49:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#215: FILE: fs/devlist.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#259: FILE: fs/devlist.c:45:
+int register_dev(dev_t a, dev_t b, int size, const char * name,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*d)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct device_name)...)
#279: FILE: fs/devlist.c:65:
+	d = kmalloc(sizeof(struct device_name), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
