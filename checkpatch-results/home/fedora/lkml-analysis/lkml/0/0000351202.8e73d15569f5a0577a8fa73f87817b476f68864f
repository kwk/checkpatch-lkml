ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config BLK_DEV_HD_ONLY
+	bool "Old hard disk (MFM/RLL/IDE) driver"
+	depends on IDE
+	---help---
+	  There are two drivers for MFM/RLL/IDE hard disks. Most people use
+	  the newer enhanced driver, but this old one is still around for two
+	  reasons. Some older systems have strange timing problems and seem to
+	  work only with the old driver (which itself does not work with some
+	  newer systems). The other reason is that the old driver is smaller,
+	  since it lacks the enhanced functionality of the new one. This makes
+	  it a good choice for systems with very tight memory restrictions, or
+	  for systems with only older MFM/RLL/ESDI drives. Choosing the old
+	  driver can save 13 KB or so of kernel memory.
+
+	  If you are unsure, then just choose the Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL driver
+	  instead of this one. For more detailed information, read the
+	  Disk-HOWTO, available from
+	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
