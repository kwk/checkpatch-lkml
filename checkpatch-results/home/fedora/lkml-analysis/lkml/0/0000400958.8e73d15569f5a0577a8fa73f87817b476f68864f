WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#173: FILE: include/asm-i386/mach-summit/mach_apic.h:116:
+	static unsigned	next_cpu = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#175: FILE: include/asm-i386/mach-summit/mach_apic.h:118:
+	if (next_cpu >= NR_CPUS || cpu_2_logical_apicid[next_cpu] == BAD_APICID)

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#179: FILE: include/asm-i386/mach-summit/mach_apic.h:122:
+	return (val);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
