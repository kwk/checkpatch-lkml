CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dn"
#69: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pmac_pci.c:294:
+	if (dn == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#80: FILE: arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_pci.c:319:
+	struct device_node *np = pci_busdev_to_OF_node(bus, devfn);
+	if (np == NULL)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
