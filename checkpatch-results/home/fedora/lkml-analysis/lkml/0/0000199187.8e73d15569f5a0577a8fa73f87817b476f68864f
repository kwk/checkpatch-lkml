#29: 
This update only affects Unisys' ES7000 machines. The patch reflects a change needed to determine which generation of ES7000 is currently running. The next generation of ES7000s will have conventional legacy support so the patch accommodates for this. This patch has been tested and verified on both an authentic 5xx ES7000 box and the next generation ES7000 box.
