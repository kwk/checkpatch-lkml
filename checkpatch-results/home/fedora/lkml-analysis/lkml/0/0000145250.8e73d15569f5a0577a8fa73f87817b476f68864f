Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#174: FILE: init/Kconfig:90:
+config SWAP_PREFETCH
+	bool "Support for prefetching swapped memory"
+	depends on SWAP
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  This option will allow the kernel to prefetch swapped memory pages
+	  when idle. The pages will be kept on both swap and in swap_cache
+	  thus avoiding the need for further I/O if either ram or swap space
+	  is required.
+	  
+	  What this will do on workstations is slowly bring back applications
+	  that have swapped out after memory intensive workloads back into
+	  physical ram if you have free ram at a later stage and the machine
+	  is relatively idle. This means that when you come back to your
+	  computer after leaving it idle for a while, applications will come
+	  to life faster. Note that your swap usage will appear to increase
+	  but these are cached pages, can be dropped freely by the vm, and it
+	  should stabilise around 50% swap usage.
+	  
+	  Desktop users will most likely want to say Y.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:DUPLICATED_SYSCTL_CONST: duplicated sysctl range checking value 'zero', consider using the shared one in include/linux/sysctl.h
#215: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:862:
+		.extra1		= &zero,

Commit d91bff3011cf ("proc/sysctl: add shared variables for range
check") added some shared const variables to be used instead of a local
copy in each source file.

Consider replacing the sysctl range checking value with the shared
one in include/linux/sysctl.h.  The following conversion scheme may
be used::

  &zero     ->  SYSCTL_ZERO
  &one      ->  SYSCTL_ONE
  &int_max  ->  SYSCTL_INT_MAX

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
