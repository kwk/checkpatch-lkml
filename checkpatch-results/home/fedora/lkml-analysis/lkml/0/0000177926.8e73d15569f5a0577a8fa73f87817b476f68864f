ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#157: 
--- a/drivers/net/tulip/tulip_core.c	2005-05-27 22:06:00.000000000 -0400

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::
