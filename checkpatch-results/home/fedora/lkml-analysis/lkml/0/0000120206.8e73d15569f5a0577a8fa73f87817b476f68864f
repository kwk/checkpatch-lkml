WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#192: FILE: kernel/synchro-test.c:1:
+/* synchro-test.c: run some threads to test the synchronisation primitives

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

#306: FILE: kernel/synchro-test.c:115:
+#define ACCOUNT(var, N) var##_taken[N]++;

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \

    } while (0)

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#306: FILE: kernel/synchro-test.c:115:
+#define ACCOUNT(var, N) var##_taken[N]++;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#695: FILE: kernel/synchro-test.c:504:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
