#47: 
I checked in the i386 code (the _syscall5 macro and the sys_clone definition). 

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+ * this, too.*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
