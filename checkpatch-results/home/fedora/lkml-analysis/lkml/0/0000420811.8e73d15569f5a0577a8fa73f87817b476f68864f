The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/bitops.h> instead of <asm/bitops.h>
#69: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/kwatch.c:12:
+#include <asm/bitops.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#264: FILE: include/asm-i386/kwatch.h:27:
+static inline int register_kwatch(unsigned long addr, u8 length, u8 type, kwatch_handler_t handler) { return -ENOSYS; }

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#264: FILE: include/asm-i386/kwatch.h:27:
+static inline int register_kwatch(unsigned long addr, u8 length, u8 type, kwatch_handler_t handler) { return -ENOSYS; }

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
