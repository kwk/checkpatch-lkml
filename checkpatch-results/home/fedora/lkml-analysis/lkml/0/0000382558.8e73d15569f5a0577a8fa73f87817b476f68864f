ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#47: FILE: inode.c:56:
+               inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#47: FILE: inode.c:56:
+               inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = $

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#47: FILE: inode.c:56:
+               inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = 

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
