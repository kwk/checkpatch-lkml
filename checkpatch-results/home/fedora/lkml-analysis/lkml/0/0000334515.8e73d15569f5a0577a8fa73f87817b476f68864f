CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#126: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/setup.c:420:
+	end_pfn = max_pfn = memory_end >> PAGE_SHIFT;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#143: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/setup.c:499:
+	lc->kernel_stack = ((unsigned long) &init_thread_union) + THREAD_SIZE;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#192: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/smp.c:529:
+        cpu_lowcore->current_task = (unsigned long) idle;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#284: FILE: include/asm-s390/hardirq.h:23:
+ * on the lowcore */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#307: FILE: include/asm-s390/hardirq.h:84:
+	BUG_ON( hardirq_count() );					\

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
