CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#150: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:890:
+		rq->bio = rq->biotail = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:IF_0: Consider removing the code enclosed by this #if 0 and its #endif

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#248: FILE: mm/highmem.c:28:
+	int gfp = gfp_mask | (int) data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#259: FILE: mm/highmem.c:257:
+	isa_page_pool = mempool_create(ISA_POOL_SIZE, page_pool_alloc, page_pool_free, (void *) __GFP_DMA);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
