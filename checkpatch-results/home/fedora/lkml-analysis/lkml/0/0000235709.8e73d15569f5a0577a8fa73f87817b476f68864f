ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#67: FILE: kobject_uevent.c:262:
+^I/* reserve space for the sequence, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#68: FILE: kobject_uevent.c:263:
+	 * put the real one in after the hotplug call */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided

+	envp[i++] = seq_buff = scratch;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
