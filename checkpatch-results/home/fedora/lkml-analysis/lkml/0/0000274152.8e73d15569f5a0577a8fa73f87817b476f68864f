CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#68: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:639:
+	psmouse->pktcnt = psmouse->cmdcnt = psmouse->out_of_sync = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
