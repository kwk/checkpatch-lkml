WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#36: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .2
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#70: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#75: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/airo.h:1:
+#ifndef _AIRO_H_

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#168: FILE: drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c:302:
+	return sprintf(buf, "usb:v%04Xp%04Xd%04Xdc%02Xdsc%02Xdp%02X"
+			"ic%02Xisc%02Xip%02X\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:MISSING_SPACE: break quoted strings at a space character
#168: FILE: drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c:302:
+	return sprintf(buf, "usb:v%04Xp%04Xd%04Xdc%02Xdsc%02Xdp%02X"
+			"ic%02Xisc%02Xip%02X\n",

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <idVendor>
#169: FILE: drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c:303:
+			le16_to_cpu(udev->descriptor.idVendor),

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <idProduct>
#170: FILE: drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c:304:
+			le16_to_cpu(udev->descriptor.idProduct),

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bcdDevice>
#171: FILE: drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c:305:
+			le16_to_cpu(udev->descriptor.bcdDevice),

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bDeviceClass>
#172: FILE: drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c:306:
+			udev->descriptor.bDeviceClass,

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bDeviceSubClass>
#173: FILE: drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c:307:

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bDeviceProtocol>
#174: FILE: drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c:308:

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bInterfaceProtocol>
#177: FILE: drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c:311:
+			alt->desc.bInterfaceProtocol);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#316: FILE: fs/exec.c:754:
+	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&sig->count) != 1);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#401: FILE: net/ipv4/ipvs/ip_vs_core.c:1014:
+		/* don't restart its timer, and silently
+		   drop the packet. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#401: FILE: net/ipv4/ipvs/ip_vs_core.c:1014:
+		   drop the packet. */
