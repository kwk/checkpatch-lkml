CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#52: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:267:
+extern int remove_vma_swap(struct vm_area_struct *vma, struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#74: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:544:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
