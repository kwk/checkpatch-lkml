CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#104: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:219:
+				pte_base = pte = (pte_t *) alloc_bootmem_low_pages(PAGE_SIZE);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#104: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:219:
+				pte_base = pte = (pte_t *) alloc_bootmem_low_pages(PAGE_SIZE);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#107: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:221:
+				for (k = 0; k < PTRS_PER_PTE && pfn < max_low_pfn; pte++, pfn++, k++)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
