CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'par->max_pixclock < VOODOO3_MAX_PIXCLOCK'

+	if (((var->vmode & FB_VMODE_MASK) == FB_VMODE_INTERLACED) &&

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#97: FILE: drivers/video/tdfxfb.c:622:
+		vbs = vd = (info->var.yres << 1) - 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
