CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#40: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:538:
+extern void FASTCALL(____wake_up(wait_queue_head_t *q, unsigned int mode, unsigned int wq_mode));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#153: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c:164:
+		____wake_up(&sem->wait, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE | TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, WQ_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
