WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#45: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:67:
+	/* Valid image is on the disk, if we continue we risk serious data corruption
+	   after resume. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#46: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:68:
+	while(1);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#88: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:618:
+					memcpy((void *)pbe->address, (void *)pbe->orig_address, PAGE_SIZE);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
