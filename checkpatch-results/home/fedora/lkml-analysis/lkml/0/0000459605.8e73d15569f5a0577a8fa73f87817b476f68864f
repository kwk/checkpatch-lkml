WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#57: 
dcache_readdir inconsistantly counts entries in the d_subdirs list. The code

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#74: FILE: fs/readdir.c:74:
+					struct dentry *de = list_entry(list, struct dentry, d_child);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#75: FILE: fs/readdir.c:75:
+					struct dentry *de = list_entry(list, struct dentry, d_child);
+					if (!list_empty(&de->d_hash) && de->d_inode) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#76: FILE: fs/readdir.c:76:
+						if (!j)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
