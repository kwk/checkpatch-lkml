#28: 
probing for UART_BUG_TXEN in 8250 driver leads to weird effects on some ARM boards (pnx4008 for instance). That is, the driver detects  UART_BUG_TXEN (though it apparently shouldn't) and it leads to symbol loss in console on input (i. e. you input 'a' and you get nothing, then you input 'b' and you get 'a', then you input 'c' and get 'b' and so on).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#55: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1664:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
