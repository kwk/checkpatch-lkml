WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+	for (i = 1; i < hvsi_udbg_buf_len; i++) {
+		hvsi_udbg_buf[i-1] = hvsi_udbg_buf[i];
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
