ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#55: 
--- a/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.c

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#73: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.c:2772:
+	if (dt) {
[...]
+	} else if (period == 9)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
