WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#63: FILE: mm/nommu.c:574:
+			if (ret == (unsigned long) -ENOSYS)

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
