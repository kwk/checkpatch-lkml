WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'documentataion' may be misspelled - perhaps 'documentation'?

             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#205: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.c:2020:
+			/* Don't go to out_err, you can only do that if
+			   the device is registered already. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
