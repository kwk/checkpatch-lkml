ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#46: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:342:
+			unsigned long endvma = vma->vm_end; 
+			if (endvma > end)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
