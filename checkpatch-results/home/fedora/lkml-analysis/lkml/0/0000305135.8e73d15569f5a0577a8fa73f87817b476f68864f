  ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#37: 
Can you test this patch please?  It essentially implements Paulus' suggestion.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#85: FILE: mm/mmap.c:762:
+				start_addr = addr = unmapped_base;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#91: FILE: mm/mmap.c:768:
+		/* On the first pass always skip the brk gap to not
+		   confuse glibc malloc.  This can happen with user

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
