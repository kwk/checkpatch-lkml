ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#32: FILE: fs/isofs/rock.c:156:
+  if (buffer) kfree(buffer);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:NEEDLESS_IF: kfree(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required
