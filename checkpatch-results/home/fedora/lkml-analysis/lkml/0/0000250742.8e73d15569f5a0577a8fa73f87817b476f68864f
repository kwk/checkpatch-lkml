#43: FILE: drivers/net/wan/sdla_fr.c:3983:
+					ptr_trc_el = (void*)card->u.f.trc_el_base;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
