CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: include/linux/timex.h:307:
+extern unsigned long time_interpolator_get_offset(long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'long' should also have an identifier name
#77: FILE: include/linux/timex.h:307:
+extern unsigned long time_interpolator_get_offset(long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#89: FILE: kernel/time.c:497:
+		nsec = xtime.tv_nsec+time_interpolator_get_offset(seq);
 		                    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
