ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#31: 
--- a/fs/namei.c	Thu Oct 31 02:39:30 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#74: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:113:
+#define MS_POSIXACL	(1<<16)	/* VFS does not apply the umask */
                    	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#74: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:113:
+#define MS_POSIXACL	(1<<16)	/* VFS does not apply the umask */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
