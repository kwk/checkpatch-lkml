# This is a BitKeeper generated diff -Nru style patch.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#60: 
--- a/include/net/dst.h	2004-12-30 01:11:18 -05:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#78: FILE: include/net/xfrm.h:182:
+struct xfrm_bundle_list
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#80: FILE: include/net/xfrm.h:184:
+	struct dst_entry *	dst;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#97: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_policy.c:712:
+	struct net_device *dev = dst->dev;
+	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&bundle.node);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
