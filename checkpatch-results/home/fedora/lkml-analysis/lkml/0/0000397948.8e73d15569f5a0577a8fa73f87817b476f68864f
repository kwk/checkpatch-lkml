WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#33: 
is that the filp variable is NULL at posix_lock_file. The NULL value
            ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

should be written as::

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#184: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:571:
+extern int posix_lock_file(struct inode *, struct file_lock *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#184: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:571:
+extern int posix_lock_file(struct inode *, struct file_lock *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
