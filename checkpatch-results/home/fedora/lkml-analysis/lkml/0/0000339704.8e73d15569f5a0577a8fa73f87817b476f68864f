ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#38: 
--- a/kernel/configs.c	Thu Sep  4 10:35:39 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#123: FILE: kernel/configs.c:69:
+static struct file_operations config_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ikconfig_dir"
#177: FILE: kernel/configs.c:112:
+	if (ikconfig_dir == NULL) 

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#187: FILE: kernel/configs.c:117:
+	entry = create_proc_entry("config", S_IFREG | S_IRUGO, ikconfig_dir);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#198: FILE: kernel/configs.c:122:
+	entry->size = ikconfig_size = strlen(ikconfig_config);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
