#30: 
this patch removes some useless casts to and from (void *) as well as a cast

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*slot_cur->func)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct pci_func)...)
#169: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/ibmphp_core.c:1144:
+	slot_cur->func = kmalloc(sizeof(struct pci_func), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
