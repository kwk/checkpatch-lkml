CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:72:
+extern int remove_work(struct workqueue_struct *wq, struct work_struct *work);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#109: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:551:
+	 * process of executing */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#113: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:555:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
