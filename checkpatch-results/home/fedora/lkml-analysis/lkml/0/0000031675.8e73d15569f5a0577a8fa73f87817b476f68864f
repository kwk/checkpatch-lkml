ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#71: FILE: include/asm-generic/bug.h:48:
*/\

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#72: FILE: include/asm-generic/bug.h:49:
+       /* check 'condition' first to avoid cache miss with __warn_once
+       if (unlikely(__ret_warn_once))                  \

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
