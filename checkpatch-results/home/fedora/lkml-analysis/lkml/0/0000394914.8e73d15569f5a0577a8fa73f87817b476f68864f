The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#450: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:198:
+extern struct sys_device device_apic;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#458: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:205:
+        return device_register(&device_nmi);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#458: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:205:

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#473: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:300:
+void setup_apic_nmi_watchdog (void)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#530: FILE: arch/i386/oprofile/nmi_int.c:70:
+static int nmi_enabled = 0;	/* 0 == registered but off, 1 == registered and on */

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#550: FILE: arch/i386/oprofile/nmi_int.c:90:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
