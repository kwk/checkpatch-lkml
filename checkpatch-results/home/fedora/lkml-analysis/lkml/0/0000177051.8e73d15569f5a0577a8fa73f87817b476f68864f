        OCFS2 wants to mark an inode which has been orphaned by another node

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#31:

                     ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#57: FILE: fs/inode.c:1059:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(generic_drop_inode);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1414:
+extern void generic_drop_inode(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
