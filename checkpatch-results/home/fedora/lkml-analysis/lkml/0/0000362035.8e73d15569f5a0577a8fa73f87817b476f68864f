WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'commnad' may be misspelled - perhaps 'command'?
#34: 
that for processes with >4k command lines, the commnad line available 
                                               ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'truncat' may be misspelled - perhaps 'truncate'?

                                            ^^^^^^^

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#62: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:30:
+ /*
+ * What to put in the command line when we truncat them.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#69: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:37:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
