#27: 
[PATCH] PCI: make drivers use the pci shutdown callback instead of the driver core callback.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#75: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptscsih.c:173:
+void ^I^Imptscsih_shutdown(struct pci_dev *);$

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#75: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptscsih.c:173:
+void 		mptscsih_shutdown(struct pci_dev *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_dev *' should also have an identifier name
#75: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptscsih.c:173:
+void 		mptscsih_shutdown(struct pci_dev *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
