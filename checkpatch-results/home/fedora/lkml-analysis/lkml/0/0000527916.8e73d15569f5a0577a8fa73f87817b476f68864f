WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#66: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-irq.c:405:
+	u8 irq;
+	irq = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#67: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-irq.c:406:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
