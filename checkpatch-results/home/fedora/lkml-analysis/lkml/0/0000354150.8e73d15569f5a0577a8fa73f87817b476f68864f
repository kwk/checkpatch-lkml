CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#135: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:461:
+	q->rq.pending[READ] = q->rq.pending[WRITE] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'rw == WRITE'
#158: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:565:
+		if ((rw == WRITE) || (rw == READ && rl->pending[READ] > rlim))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#201: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:903:
+			printk("too many: %u + %u > %u\n", rl->pending[READ], rl->pending[WRITE], q->nr_requests);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#262: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:299:
+static inline int blk_oversized_queue_reads(request_queue_t * q)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
