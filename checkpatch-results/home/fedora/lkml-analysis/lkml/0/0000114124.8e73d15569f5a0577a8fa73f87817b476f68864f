CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/smp_lock.h:42:
+extern int __lockfunc trylock_kernel(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#115: FILE: lib/kernel_lock.c:87:
+			return 0;
+		else

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#123: FILE: lib/kernel_lock.c:95:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
