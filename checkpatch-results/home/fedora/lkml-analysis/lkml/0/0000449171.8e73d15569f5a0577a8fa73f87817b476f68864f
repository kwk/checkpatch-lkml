that patch should be mergable as it is.
                     ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 130 exceeds 100 columns
#56: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1339:
+		devpts_pty_new(driver->other->name_base + minor, MKDEV(driver->other->major, minor + driver->other->minor_start));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#224: FILE: fs/devpts/inode.c:47:
+		if (sscanf(this_char, "uid=%i%c", &n, &dummy) == 1) {
[...]
-		else if (!strcmp(this_char,"gid")) {
[...]
-			gid = simple_strtoul(value,&value,0);
[...]
-				return 1;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#328: FILE: fs/devpts/inode.c:96:
+	devpts_root = s->s_root = d_alloc_root(inode);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#356: FILE: fs/devpts/inode.c:128:
+	struct dentry *root = devpts_root;
+	down(&root->d_inode->i_sem);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#628: FILE: include/linux/devpts_fs.h:19:
+void devpts_pty_kill(int);		/* unlink */

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
