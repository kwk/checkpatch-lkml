#47: FILE: fs/Kconfig:763:
+config PROC_UPDIKE

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo**bar" should be "foo **bar"
#66: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:157:
+static int updike_read_proc(char *page, char**start, off_t off,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#76: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:167:
+	while ((i < days) && (i <= PAGE_SIZE - 4)) {
+		page[++i] = '=';
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
