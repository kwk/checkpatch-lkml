ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#50: FILE: kernel/sys.c:371:
void __user * arg)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#52: FILE: kernel/sys.c:373:
+			   unsigned int cmd, void __user * arg)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#99: FILE: kernel/sys.c:432:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
