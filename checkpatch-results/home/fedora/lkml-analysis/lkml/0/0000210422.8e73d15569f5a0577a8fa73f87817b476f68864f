WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#115: FILE: fs/hpfs/dentry.c:52:
+static struct dentry_operations hpfs_dentry_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
