The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#142: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-cs5535.c:55:
+/* The hardware supports interrupt driven mode too, but I haven't

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#269: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-cs5535.c:182:
+		/* fallthrough */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#349: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-cs5535.c:262:
+	while (time_before(jiffies, timeout)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
