Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#62: FILE: drivers/net/ns83820.c:800:
+	struct sk_buff *tmp = __dev_alloc_skb(len+2, GFP_ATOMIC);
+	if (!tmp)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
