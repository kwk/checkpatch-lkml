WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#57: FILE: security/sysctl_capable.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
