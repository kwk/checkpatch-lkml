CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#242: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:92:
+extern unsigned long nr_iowait(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#274: FILE: kernel/sched.c:581:
+	for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; ++i)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#306: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1736:
+	struct runqueue *rq;
+	preempt_disable();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
