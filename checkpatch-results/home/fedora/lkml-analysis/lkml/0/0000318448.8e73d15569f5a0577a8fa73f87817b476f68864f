WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#104: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:7:
+/**
+* Allan Bezerra (ajsb@dcc.fua.br) &

line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
