ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#62: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:642:
+int safe_smp_processor_id(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#83: FILE: include/asm-i386/smp.h:93:
+extern int safe_smp_processor_id(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
