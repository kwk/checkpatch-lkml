CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/linux/memory_hotplug.h:91:
+extern void arch_refresh_nodedata(int nid, pg_data_t *pgdat);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#75: FILE: include/linux/memory_hotplug.h:134:
 }
+static inline void generic_refresh_nodedata(int nid, pg_data_t *pgdat)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
