#50: 
   NTFS: 2.0.12 - Initial cleanup of address space operations following 2.0.11 changes.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#64: 
--- a/Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt	Sun Jun 30 13:42:23 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_VARIABLE: Use of EXTRA_CFLAGS is deprecated, please use `ccflags-y instead.
#128: FILE: fs/ntfs/Makefile:8:
+EXTRA_CFLAGS = -DNTFS_VERSION=\"2.0.12\"

EXTRA_{A,C,CPP,LD}FLAGS are deprecated and should be replaced by the new
flags added via commit f77bf01425b1 ("kbuild: introduce ccflags-y,
asflags-y and ldflags-y").

The following conversion scheme maybe used::

  EXTRA_AFLAGS    ->  asflags-y
  EXTRA_CFLAGS    ->  ccflags-y
  EXTRA_CPPFLAGS  ->  cppflags-y
  EXTRA_LDFLAGS   ->  ldflags-y

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#235: FILE: fs/ntfs/aops.c:130:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
