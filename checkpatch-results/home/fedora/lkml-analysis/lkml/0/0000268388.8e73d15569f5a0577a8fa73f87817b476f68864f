WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#52: FILE: include/linux/rmap.h:97:
+unsigned long page_address_in_vma(struct page *, struct vm_area_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct vm_area_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#52: FILE: include/linux/rmap.h:97:
+unsigned long page_address_in_vma(struct page *, struct vm_area_struct *);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#68: FILE: mm/rmap.c:239:
+	if (PageAnon(page)) {
[...]
+	} else if (page->mapping && !(vma->vm_flags & VM_NONLINEAR)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#100: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:523:
+static unsigned long unuse_vma(struct vm_area_struct * vma,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
