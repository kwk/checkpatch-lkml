CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*mcp)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct mcp)...)
#44: FILE: drivers/mfd/mcp-core.c:203:
+	mcp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct mcp) + size, GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
