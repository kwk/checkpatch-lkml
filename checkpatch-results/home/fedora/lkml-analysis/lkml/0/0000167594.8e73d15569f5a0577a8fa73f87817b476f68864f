ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#89: FILE: fs/9p/vfs_dir.c:212:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#138: FILE: fs/9p/vfs_file.c:382:
+	if (ret) {
[...]
+		return -EFAULT;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
