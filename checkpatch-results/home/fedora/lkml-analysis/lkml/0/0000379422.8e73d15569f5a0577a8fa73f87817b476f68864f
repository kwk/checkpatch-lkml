Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "priv->tty->driver.modem_ctrl"
#153: FILE: drivers/net/irda/irtty-sir.c:204:
+	ASSERT(priv->tty->driver.modem_ctrl != NULL, return -1;);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#171: FILE: drivers/net/irda/sir_kthread.c:160:
+		 * Jean II */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
