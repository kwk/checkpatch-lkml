WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rescue_pages', this function's name, in a string
#79: FILE: mm/readahead.c:725:
+	dprintk("rescue_pages(ino=%lu, index=%lu nr=%lu)\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#109: FILE: mm/readahead.c:755:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
