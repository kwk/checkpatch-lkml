#54: 
In the absense of a pointer to a userspace tool, I found the following handy.
       ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#126: FILE: kernel/timer_top.c:156:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#128: FILE: kernel/timer_top.c:158:
