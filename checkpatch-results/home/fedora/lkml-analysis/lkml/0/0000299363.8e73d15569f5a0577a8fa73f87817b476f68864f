CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#67: FILE: fs/smbfs/inode.c:777:
+	oldmnt = (struct smb_mount_data *) data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#71: FILE: fs/smbfs/inode.c:781:
+		struct file_system_type *type = get_fs_type("smbfs_binary");
+		sb = get_sb_nodev(type, flags, data, smb_fill_super);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
