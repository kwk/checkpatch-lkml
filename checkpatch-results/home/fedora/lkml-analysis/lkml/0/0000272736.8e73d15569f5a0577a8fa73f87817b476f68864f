WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

+machvec_tlb_migrate_finish (struct mm_struct *mm)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#158: FILE: include/asm-ia64/machvec.h:77:
+extern void machvec_tlb_migrate_finish (struct mm_struct *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct mm_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#158: FILE: include/asm-ia64/machvec.h:77:
+extern void machvec_tlb_migrate_finish (struct mm_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
