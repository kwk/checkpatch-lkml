Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Non-standard signature: 'Signoff-by:' - perhaps 'Signed-off-by:'?
#55: 
Signoff-by: Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_dev *' should also have an identifier name
#66: FILE: include/linux/agp_backend.h:103:
+extern struct agp_bridge_data * (*agp_find_bridge)(struct pci_dev *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
