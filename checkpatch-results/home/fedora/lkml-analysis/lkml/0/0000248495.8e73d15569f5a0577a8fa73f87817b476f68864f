ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#50: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1029:
			    kernel_cap_t * inheritable,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#54: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1030:
+	int (*sysctl) (struct ctl_table * table, int op);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
