CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#144: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:2661:
+	cgc.cmd[8] = cgc.buflen = 8;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#148: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:2664:
+	if ((ret = cdo->generic_packet(cdi, &cgc))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
