#116: FILE: arch/i386/mm/ioremap.c:206:
+	return (void*) (offset + fix_to_virt(FIX_BTMAP_BEGIN));

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#176: FILE: include/asm-i386/io.h:102:
+extern void *bt_ioremap(unsigned long offset, unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
