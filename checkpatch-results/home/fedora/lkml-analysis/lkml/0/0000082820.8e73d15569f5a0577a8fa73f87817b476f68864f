WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#63: FILE: kernel/sys.c:113:
+	BUG_ON(addr_in_init_section(n)

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#64: FILE: kernel/sys.c:114:
+	BUG_ON(addr_in_init_section(n)
+		 || addr_in_init_section(n->notifier_call));
