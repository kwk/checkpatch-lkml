WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#40: 
#ifdef CONFIG_X86

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#130: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:99:
+extern void dump_stack(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#147: FILE: lib/dump_stack.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_notice([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_notice(dev, ... then pr_notice(...  to printk(KERN_NOTICE ...
#157: FILE: lib/dump_stack.c:11:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dump_stack', this function's name, in a string
#158: FILE: lib/dump_stack.c:12:
+		"This architecture does not implement dump_stack()\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
