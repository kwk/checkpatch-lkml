ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#97: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:1048:
+^I           test_bit(DMF_FREEING, &md->flags))) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#110: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:1088:
+	BUG_ON(test_bit(DMF_FREEING, &md->flags));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
