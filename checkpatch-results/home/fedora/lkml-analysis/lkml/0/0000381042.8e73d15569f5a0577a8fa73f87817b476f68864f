This patch is a forward port of the fairsched-2.4.19 patch by Rik van Riel, which

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#158: FILE: kernel/sched.c:40:
+int fairsched = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#160: FILE: kernel/sched.c:42:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#178: FILE: kernel/sched.c:330:
+	if(fairsched){
+		/* special processing for per-user fair scheduler */
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
