Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#47: FILE: drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c:405:
+		if (!left)
[...]
+	 else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#55: FILE: drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c:413:
+			/*  the low bit is optional in the tone sliders and masking
+			    it lets us avoid the 0xf 'bypass'.. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

#81: FILE: drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c:583:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
