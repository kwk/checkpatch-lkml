#27: 
The sighand cache is only used in fs/exec.c and kernel/fork.c. It is defined

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#41: FILE: fs/exec.c:65:
+extern kmem_cache_t	*sighand_cachep;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
