I've been following the recent 2.4.1-pre series and am wondering why the following one-liner

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'drivers' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (7, 15)
#35: FILE: md/raid5.c:1073:
        while ((bh=return_fail)) {
+               return_fail = bh->b_reqnext;

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#37: FILE: md/raid5.c:1074:
+               return_fail = bh->b_reqnext;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
