ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#57: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2528:
back

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#65: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2533:
+/* Semaphore wakeups, Daniel Phillips, phillips@innominate.de, 2000/12
+

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#80: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2544:
+	if (!block)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#133: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2725:
+^I        waiters = atomic_read(&bdflush_waiters);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#138: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2730:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
