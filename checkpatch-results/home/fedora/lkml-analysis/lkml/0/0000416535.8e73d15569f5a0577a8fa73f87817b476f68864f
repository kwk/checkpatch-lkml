WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#63: FILE: include/asm-ia64/system.h:440:
+#define finish_arch_switch(rq, prev)		\
+do {	spin_unlock_irq(&(prev)->switch_lock);	\
+} while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'p' - possible side-effects?
#67: FILE: include/asm-ia64/system.h:444:
+#define task_running(rq, p) \
+	((rq)->curr == (p) || spin_is_locked(&(p)->switch_lock))

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#68: FILE: include/asm-ia64/system.h:445:
+	((rq)->curr == (p) || spin_is_locked(&(p)->switch_lock))

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
