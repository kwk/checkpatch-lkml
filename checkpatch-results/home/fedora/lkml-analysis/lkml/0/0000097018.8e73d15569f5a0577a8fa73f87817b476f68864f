CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cpu_index < 0'
#85: FILE: drivers/acpi/processor_core.c:469:
+	if (!cpu0_initialized && (cpu_index < 0) && (num_online_cpus() == 1)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#85: FILE: drivers/acpi/processor_core.c:469:
+	if (!cpu0_initialized && (cpu_index < 0) && (num_online_cpus() == 1)) {
 		cpu_index = 0;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
