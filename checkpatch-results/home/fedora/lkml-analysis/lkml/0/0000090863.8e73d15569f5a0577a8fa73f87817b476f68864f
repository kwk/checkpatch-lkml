Introduces config option CONFIG_UTS_NS and uts_namespace structure for this.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#120: FILE: include/linux/utsname.h:41:
+extern struct uts_namespace *create_uts_ns(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*ns)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct uts_namespace)...)
#168: FILE: init/version.c:37:
+	ns = kmalloc(sizeof(struct uts_namespace), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ns"
#169: FILE: init/version.c:38:
+	if (ns == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
