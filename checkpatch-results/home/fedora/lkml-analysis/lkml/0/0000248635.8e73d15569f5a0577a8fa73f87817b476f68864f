ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#57: FILE: fs/Kconfig:929:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#100: FILE: mm/shmem.c:179:
+static struct inode_operations shmem_special_inode_operations;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#198: FILE: mm/shmem.c:2020:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#201: FILE: mm/shmem.c:2023:
+static size_t shmem_xattr_security_list(struct inode *inode, char *list, const char *name, int name_len)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
