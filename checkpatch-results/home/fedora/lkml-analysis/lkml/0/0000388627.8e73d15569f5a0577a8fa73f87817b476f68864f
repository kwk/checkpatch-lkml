CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#75: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:254:
+		child->number = child->secondary = busnr;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
