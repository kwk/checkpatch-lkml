CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: include/net/ip.h:98:
+extern int		ip_fragment(struct sk_buff *skb, int (*output)(struct sk_buff *));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#85: FILE: net/bridge/br_netfilter.c:810:
+^I        br_nf_dev_queue_xmit);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#114: FILE: net/ipv4/ip_output.c:422:
+int ip_fragment(struct sk_buff *skb, int (*output)(struct sk_buff*))

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#122: FILE: net/ipv4/ip_output.c:674:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ip_fragment);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
