CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#209: FILE: include/linux/string.h:91:
+extern char *kstrdup(const char *s, int gfp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#260: FILE: lib/string.c:614:
+	if (!s) return NULL;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#436: FILE: sound/core/memory.c:191:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
