ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#84: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:97:
+		      struct dentry * dir)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#132: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:130:
+	if (!IS_ERR(dir)) {
[...]
 	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#195: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:190:
+	s = str = kstrdup(n, GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Done>
#210: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:205:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
