CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#114: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs.h:473:
+extern struct nfs4_client *nfs4_get_client(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#157: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs_sb.h:35:
+	 * This is used to generate the clientid, and the callback address. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *			bar" should be "foo *bar"
#159: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs_sb.h:37:
+	char *			mnt_path;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
