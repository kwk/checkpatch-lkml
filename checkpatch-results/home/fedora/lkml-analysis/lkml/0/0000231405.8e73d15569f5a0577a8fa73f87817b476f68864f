CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*save)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct sa1111_save_data)...)
#77: FILE: arch/arm/common/sa1111.c:813:
+	save = kmalloc(sizeof(struct sa1111_save_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#111: FILE: arch/arm/common/sa1111.c:930:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
