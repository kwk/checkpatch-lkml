ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#55: FILE: ppc/kernel/traps.c:349:
+void $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#56: FILE: ppc/kernel/traps.c:350:
+show_stack(struct task_struct *task, unsigned long * sp)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#58: FILE: ppc/kernel/traps.c:352:
+	printk(KERN_CRIT "arch/ppc/kernel/traps.c::show_stack() called but not implemented!\n");

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_crit([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_crit(dev, ... then pr_crit(...  to printk(KERN_CRIT ...
#58: FILE: ppc/kernel/traps.c:352:
+	printk(KERN_CRIT "arch/ppc/kernel/traps.c::show_stack() called but not implemented!\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'show_stack', this function's name, in a string
#58: FILE: ppc/kernel/traps.c:352:
+	printk(KERN_CRIT "arch/ppc/kernel/traps.c::show_stack() called but not implemented!\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
