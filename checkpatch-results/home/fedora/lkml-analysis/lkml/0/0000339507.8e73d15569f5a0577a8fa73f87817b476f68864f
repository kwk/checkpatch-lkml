WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#100: FILE: kernel/futex.c:75:
+	/* While a futex is waiting, this holds fd; sigio is sent using it.
+	   When woken, this holds either 0 or -EFAULT, set by the waker. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#173: FILE: kernel/futex.c:247:
+	int j, count = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#189: FILE: kernel/futex.c:263:
+			if (this->key.private.uaddr < old_start
+			    || this->key.private.uaddr - old_start >= old_len)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#199: FILE: kernel/futex.c:273:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#404: FILE: mm/mremap.c:193:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
