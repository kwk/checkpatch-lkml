WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'funciton' may be misspelled - perhaps 'function'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:JIFFIES_COMPARISON: Comparing jiffies is almost always wrong; prefer time_after, time_before and friends

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cx->latency > 150'
#106: FILE: drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c:313:
+		if (cx->demotion.state && cx->demotion.threshold.bm &&
+		    (dyn_tick->next_tick < (jiffies + 1))
+		    && (cx->latency > 150)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
