ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#78: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:1925:
+	if ((ret = blkdev_get_partition(pd->bdev, FMODE_READ, O_RDONLY)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#154: FILE: fs/block_dev.c:1050:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(blkdev_get_partition);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#167: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1458:
+extern int blkdev_get_partition(struct block_device *, mode_t, unsigned);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct block_device *' should also have an identifier name
#167: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1458:
+extern int blkdev_get_partition(struct block_device *, mode_t, unsigned);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'mode_t' should also have an identifier name
#167: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1458:
