ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#92: 
--- a/arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S	Sat Aug 17 15:26:52 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

distractions when editing files.
