ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#47: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:270:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#70: FILE: include/linux/morseops.h:1:
+/*  Yes, it's morse code ops indeed.  */

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#82: FILE: include/linux/morseops.h:13:
+static inline unsigned char tomorse(char c) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#103: FILE: include/linux/vt_kern.h:39:
+extern void kd_set_led_all(int state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#147: FILE: kernel/morse.c:2:
+ *  kernel/morse.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'distingush' may be misspelled - perhaps 'distinguish'?
#153: FILE: kernel/morse.c:8:
+ *  we have panic'd.  This is to distingush panics from "real lockups."
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#179: FILE: kernel/morse.c:34:
+#define MORSE_OUTPUT_BLINK	(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#210: FILE: kernel/morse.c:65:
+const unsigned char morsetable[] = {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
