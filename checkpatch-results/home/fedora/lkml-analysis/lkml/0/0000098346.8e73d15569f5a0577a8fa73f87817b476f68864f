WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#56: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#67: FILE: drivers/dma/Kconfig:7:
+config DMA_ENGINE
+	bool "Support for DMA engines"
+	---help---
+	  DMA engines offload copy operations from the CPU to dedicated
+	  hardware, allowing the copies to happen asynchronously.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#101: FILE: drivers/dma/dmaengine.c:15:
+this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#157: FILE: drivers/dma/dmaengine.c:71:
+	__ATTR(memcpy_count, S_IRUGO, show_memcpy_count, NULL),

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;

#227: FILE: drivers/dma/dmaengine.c:141:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

#258: FILE: drivers/dma/dmaengine.c:172:
+	list_for_each_entry(client, &dma_client_list, global_node) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
