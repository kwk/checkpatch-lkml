WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'simliar' may be misspelled - perhaps 'similar'?
#28: 
Currently the bttv and saa7134 drivers have simliar functions, but
                                            ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#49: FILE: drivers/i2c/i2c-core.c:503:
+		if (NULL == adap->clients[i])

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#55: FILE: drivers/i2c/i2c-core.c:509:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#83: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:333:
+ * the given arguments */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#84: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:334:
+extern void i2c_clients_command(struct i2c_adapter *adap,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
