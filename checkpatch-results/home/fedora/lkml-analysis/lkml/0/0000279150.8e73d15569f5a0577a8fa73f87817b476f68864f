CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Device>
#38: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.c:777:
+static int	   ahc_linux_sanity_check(Scsi_Device *);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev"
#77: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.c:3884:
+	if (dev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#81: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.c:3888:
+	if (spin_is_locked(&ahc->platform_data->spin_lock))

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/locking/lockdep-design.html#annotations

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#129: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.h:259:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
