ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#109: FILE: drivers/media/video/meye.c:789:
+	static int sequence = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#184: FILE: drivers/media/video/meye.c:1194:
+		switch (c->id) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/

a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
