#23: 
This patch adds DID support for ICH6 and 6300ESB to i2c-i801.c(SMBus).  In order to add this support I needed to patch pci_ids.h with the SMBus DID's.  To keep things orginized I renumbered the ICH6 and ESB entries in pci_ids.h.  I then patched the piix IDE and i810 audio drivers to reflect the updated #define's.  I also removed an error from irq.c; there was a reference to a 6300ESB DID that does not exist.  This patch is against the 2.6.6 kernel.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
