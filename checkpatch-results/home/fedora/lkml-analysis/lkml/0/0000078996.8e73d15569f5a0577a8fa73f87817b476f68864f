CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: include/linux/bootmem.h:57:
+extern void * __init __alloc_bootmem_low_nopanic(unsigned long size,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#65: FILE: mm/bootmem.c:478:
+void * __init __alloc_bootmem_low_nopanic(unsigned long size,
+		unsigned long align, unsigned long goal)

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#71: FILE: mm/bootmem.c:484:
+		if ((ptr = __alloc_bootmem_core(bdata, size, align, goal,

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
