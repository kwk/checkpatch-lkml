WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#155: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/serial.h:21:
+#define arch_8250_sysrq_via_ctrl_o(ch, port) ((ch) == '\x0f' && power4_sysrq_via_ctrl_o && uart_handle_break((port)))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
