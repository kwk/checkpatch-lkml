#25: 
Add some comments about the "uml-sysemu-fixes" patch of 2.6.10-mm1 (merged in 2.6.11-rc1).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#60: FILE: arch/um/kernel/tt/tracer.c:363:
+				 * loop which executed a OP_TRACE_ON request.*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
