ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#67: FILE: drivers/sound/ymfpci.c:85:
+static int synth_io = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#104: FILE: drivers/sound/ymfpci.c:1903:
+		if (instance == 0) {
[...]
+		} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
