Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#114: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:167:
+		u16 data = tf->data + (hob->data << 8);
+		hwif->OUTW(data, ports[IDE_DATA_OFFSET]);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
