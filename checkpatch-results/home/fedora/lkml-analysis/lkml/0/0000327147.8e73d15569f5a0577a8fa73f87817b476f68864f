ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_DMA_SUPPORTED' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#218: FILE: include/asm-ia64/dma-mapping.h:34:
+#define ARCH_HAS_DMA_SUPPORTED

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#292: FILE: include/asm-sparc64/dma-mapping.h:10:
+	BUG_ON(dev->bus != &pci_bus_type);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
