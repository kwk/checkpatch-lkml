CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#134: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:282:
+extern void bio_free(struct bio *, struct bio_set *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct bio *' should also have an identifier name
#134: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:282:
+extern void bio_free(struct bio *, struct bio_set *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct bio_set *' should also have an identifier name
#134: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:282:
+extern void bio_free(struct bio *, struct bio_set *);
