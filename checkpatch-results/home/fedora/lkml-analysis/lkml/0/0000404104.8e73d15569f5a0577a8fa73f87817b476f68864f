ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#39: FILE: drivers/net/Kconfig:1581:
+config NET_GIGABIT_ETH
+	bool "Ethernet (1000 Mbit)"
+	---help---
+	  Ethernet (also called IEEE 802.3 or ISO 8802-2) is the most common
+	  type of Local Area Network (LAN) in universities and companies.
+
+	  Common varieties of Ethernet are: 10BASE-2 or Thinnet (10 Mbps over
+	  coaxial cable, linking computers in a chain), 10BASE-T or twisted
+	  pair (10 Mbps over twisted pair cable, linking computers to central
+	  hubs), 10BASE-F (10 Mbps over optical fiber links, using hubs),
+	  100BASE-TX (100 Mbps over two twisted pair cables, using hubs),
+	  100BASE-T4 (100 Mbps over 4 standard voice-grade twisted pair
+	  cables, using hubs), 100BASE-FX (100 Mbps over optical fiber links)
+	  [the 100BASE varieties are also known as Fast Ethernet], and Gigabit
+	  Ethernet (1 Gbps over optical fiber or short copper links).
+
+	  If your Linux machine will be connected to an Ethernet and you have
+	  a gigabit Ethernet network interface card (NIC) installed in your
+	  computer, say Y here and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
+	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.  You will then also have
+	  to say Y to the driver for your particular NIC.
+
+	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
+	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
+	  the questions about gigabit Ethernet network cards. If unsure,
+	  say N.
+
 config ACENIC
 	tristate "Alteon AceNIC/3Com 3C985/NetGear GA620 Gigabit support"
+	depends on NET_GIGABIT_ETH && PCI
+	depends on NET_GIGABIT_ETH && PCI
 	---help---
 	  Say Y here if you have an Alteon AceNIC, 3Com 3C985(B), NetGear
 	  GA620, SGI Gigabit or Farallon PN9000-SX PCI Gigabit Ethernet

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
