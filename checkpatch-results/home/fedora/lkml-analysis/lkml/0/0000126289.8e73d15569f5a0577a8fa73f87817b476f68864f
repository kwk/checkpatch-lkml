CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/asm-frv/semaphore.h:58:
+extern void __down_sem(struct semaphore *sem, unsigned long flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '__down_sem', this function's name, in a string
#154: FILE: arch/frv/kernel/semaphore.c:46:
+	semtrace(sem, "Entering __down_sem");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
