WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#36: FILE: Makefile:4:

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#67: FILE: arch/ppc64/Kconfig:237:
+config NUMA

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

#300: FILE: drivers/hwmon/it87.c:529:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

#597: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_proto_tcp.c:366:
+	 * protocol info, in that case skip the parsing */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#663: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_helper_pptp.c:115:
+	BUG_ON(ct->status & IPS_NAT_DONE_MASK);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#668: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_helper_pptp.c:120:
+	range.min_ip = range.max_ip
+		= ct->master->tuplehash[!exp->dir].tuple.dst.ip;

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#671: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_helper_pptp.c:123:
+		range.min = range.max = exp->saved_proto;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#679: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_helper_pptp.c:131:
+	range.min_ip = range.max_ip
+		= ct->master->tuplehash[!exp->dir].tuple.src.ip;

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#682: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_helper_pptp.c:134:
+		range.min = range.max = exp->saved_proto;

WARNING:NETWORKING_BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: networking block comments don't use an empty /* line, use /* Comment...
#764: FILE: net/ipv6/exthdrs.c:680:
+	/*
+	 * ignore the dest before srcrt unless srcrt is being included.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#788: FILE: net/ipv6/ip6_flowlabel.c:228:
+	struct ipv6_txoptions * fl_opt = fl->opt;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!fopt"
#794: FILE: net/ipv6/ip6_flowlabel.c:230:
+	if (fopt == NULL || fopt->opt_flen == 0)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
