WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#122: FILE: fs/ntfs/mft.c:913:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#136: FILE: fs/ntfs/mft.c:923:
+	BUG_ON(!nr);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#139: FILE: fs/ntfs/mft.c:926:
+	maddr = (u8*)kmap(page);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
