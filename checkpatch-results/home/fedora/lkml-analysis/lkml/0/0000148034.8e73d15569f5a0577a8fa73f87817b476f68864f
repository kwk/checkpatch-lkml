The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#72: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-irq.c:672:
+		switch(router->device)
+		{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#72: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-irq.c:672:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
