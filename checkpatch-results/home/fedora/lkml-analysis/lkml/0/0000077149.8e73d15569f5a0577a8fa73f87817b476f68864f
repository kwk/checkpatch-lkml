CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/elf.h> instead of <asm/elf.h>
#64: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.c:16:
+#include <asm/elf.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#119: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c:73:
+	struct page *p = virt_to_page(adr - vma->vm_start + syscall_page);
+	get_page(p);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#128: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c:82:
+static struct vm_operations_struct syscall_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#156: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c:110:
+	if ((ret = insert_vm_struct(mm, vma))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#195: FILE: arch/i386/mm/pgtable.c:142:
+static int nr_fixmaps = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#211: FILE: arch/i386/mm/pgtable.c:160:
+	BUG_ON(nr_fixmaps > 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_SETUP_ADDITIONAL_PAGES' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#241: FILE: include/asm-i386/elf.h:137:
+#define ARCH_HAS_SETUP_ADDITIONAL_PAGES

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#243: FILE: include/asm-i386/elf.h:139:
+extern int arch_setup_additional_pages(struct linux_binprm *bprm,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#244: FILE: include/asm-i386/elf.h:140:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
