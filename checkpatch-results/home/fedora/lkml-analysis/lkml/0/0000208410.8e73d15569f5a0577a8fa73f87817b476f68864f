CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#83: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:461:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#85: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:463:
+	/* Check limitations.
+		1. System must be running (weird things happen during bootup)

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:USE_NEGATIVE_ERRNO: return of an errno should typically be negative (ie: return -EINVAL)
#89: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:467:
+		return EINVAL;

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#98: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:476:
+void sn_bte_bzero_init(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#109: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/setup.c:254:
+	extern void sn_bte_bzero_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
