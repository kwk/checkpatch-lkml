WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#79: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:79:
+	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&pd->cdrw.pending_bios) <= 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#191: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:2093:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#309: FILE: include/linux/pktcdvd.h:235:
+struct packet_stacked_data
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
