CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/smb_fs.h:201:
+extern void smb_install_null_ops(struct smb_ops *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#118: FILE: fs/smbfs/proc.c:3442:
+static struct smb_ops smb_ops_null =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
