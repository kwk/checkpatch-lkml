Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#127: FILE: include/linux/delay.h:46:
+ */ $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
#133: FILE: include/linux/delay.h:52:
+#define msleep_interruptible(msecs)		\

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#145: FILE: include/linux/delay.h:64:
+#define msleep_wq_interruptible(msecs)		\
+	__msleep_wq_state(msecs, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
