CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'mm == NULL'
#66: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:254:
+	if ((mm == NULL) || (mm == &init_mm))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'mm == &init_mm'
#66: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:254:
+	if ((mm == NULL) || (mm == &init_mm))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mm"
#66: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:254:
+	if ((mm == NULL) || (mm == &init_mm))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
