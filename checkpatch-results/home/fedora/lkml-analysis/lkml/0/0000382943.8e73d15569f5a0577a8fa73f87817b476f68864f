Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#48: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:55:
+               inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = zerotime;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
