# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#177: FILE: net/core/dev.c:1083:
+		if ((skb = skb_checksum_help(skb)) == NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#240: FILE: net/core/dev.c:1517:
+	skb->h.raw = skb->nh.raw = skb->data;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#266: FILE: net/packet/af_packet.c:1329:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
