The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#123: FILE: drivers/leds/ledtrig-timer.c:61:
+static void led_timer_setdata(struct led_device *led_dev, unsigned long duty, unsigned long frequency)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#166: FILE: drivers/leds/ledtrig-timer.c:104:
+	unsigned long state = simple_strtoul(buf, &after, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*timer_data)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct timer_trig_data)...)
#218: FILE: drivers/leds/ledtrig-timer.c:156:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
