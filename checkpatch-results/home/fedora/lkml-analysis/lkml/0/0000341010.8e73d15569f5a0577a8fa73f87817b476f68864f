Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#161: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:464:
+	if (!res) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#169: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:472:
+static struct file_operations proc_stat_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
