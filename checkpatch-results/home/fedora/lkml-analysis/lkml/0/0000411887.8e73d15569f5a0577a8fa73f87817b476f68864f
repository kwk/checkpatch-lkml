WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#56: FILE: drivers/acpi/acpi_ksyms.c:149:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ec_read);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#94: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:259:
+	if (!err) {
[...]
+	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#98: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:263:
+	}
+	else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#126: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:587:
+	   we now have the *real* EC info, so kill the makeshift one.*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*ec_ecdt)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct acpi_ec)...)
#191: FILE: drivers/acpi/ec.c:773:
+	ec_ecdt = kmalloc(sizeof(struct acpi_ec), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
