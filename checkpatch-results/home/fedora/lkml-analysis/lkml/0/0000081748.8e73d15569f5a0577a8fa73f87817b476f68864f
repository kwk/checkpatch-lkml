The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#54: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:123:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#65: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:134:
+	{RESOURCE_TYPE_TOKEN, RES_STRING"=%s"},

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#136: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:205:
+		if (ctlr) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#139: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:208:

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#162: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:231:
+			j = snprintf(buf, bufsize, "%s=%s,%s=%d,%s=%d,%s=%d\n",

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#187: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:265:
+		.ca_mode = S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
