WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#49: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/vsyscall.c:55:
+extern unsigned long long monotonic_base;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#86: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/vsyscall.c:277:
+	return (nsec);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
