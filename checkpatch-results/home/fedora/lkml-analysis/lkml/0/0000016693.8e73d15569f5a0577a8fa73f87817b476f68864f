Subject: [PATCH] large pci adress space in pci/probe.c for linux-2.6.18
                           ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#63: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:170:
+				/* if BAR space is over 4GB we need to make sure that

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
