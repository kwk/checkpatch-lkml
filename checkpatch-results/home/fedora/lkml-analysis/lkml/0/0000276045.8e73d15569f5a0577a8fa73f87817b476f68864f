#55: FILE: include/asm-alpha/smp.h:53:
+int smp_call_function_on_cpu(void (*func) (void *info), void *info,int retry, int wait, cpumask_t cpu);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
