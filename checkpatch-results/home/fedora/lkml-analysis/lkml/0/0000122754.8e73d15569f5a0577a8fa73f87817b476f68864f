CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*alarm_events)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct tlclk_alarms)...)
#84: FILE: drivers/char/tlclk.c:205:
+	alarm_events = kzalloc(sizeof(struct tlclk_alarms), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
