Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#57: FILE: lib/zlib_inflate/infblock.c:83:
+    z->adler = s->check = (*s->checkfn)(0L, NULL, 0);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
