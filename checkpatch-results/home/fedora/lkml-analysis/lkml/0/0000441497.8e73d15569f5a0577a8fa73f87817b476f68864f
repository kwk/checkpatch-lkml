#39: 
Yeah, this should be fixed. unregister_netdevice() sleeps under rtnl_lock().

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'net' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

+          device to become free.$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#51: FILE: core/dev.c:2581:
+       /* We don't have to hold rtnl semaphore while we're waiting for
+          device to become free.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
