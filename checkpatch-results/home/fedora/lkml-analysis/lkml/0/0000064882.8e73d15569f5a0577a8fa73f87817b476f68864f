ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#114: FILE: kernel/power/Kconfig:101:
+ $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#146: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:41:
+int suspend_post_context_save(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
