#33: 
This was forgot in a previous patch so UML does not compile with TT mode enabled.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:204:
+extern void stop(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
