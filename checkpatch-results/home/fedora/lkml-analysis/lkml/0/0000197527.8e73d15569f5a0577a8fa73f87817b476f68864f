ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#38: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:107:
+asmlinkage int printk_nospam(unsigned int magic, const char * fmt, ...)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __printf(2, 3) over __attribute__((format(printf, 2, 3)))

#41: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:110:
+/* Don't print the previously printed message had the same magic or the rate

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

distractions when editing files.
