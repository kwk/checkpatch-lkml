ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
