ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#69: FILE: t/linux-fuse/fs/fuse/dev.c:173:
+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#92: FILE: t/linux-fuse/fs/fuse/dev.c:192:
+		void (*end) (struct fuse_conn *, struct fuse_req *) = req->end;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#93: FILE: t/linux-fuse/fs/fuse/dev.c:193:
+		void (*end) (struct fuse_conn *, struct fuse_req *) = req->end;
+		req->end = NULL;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
