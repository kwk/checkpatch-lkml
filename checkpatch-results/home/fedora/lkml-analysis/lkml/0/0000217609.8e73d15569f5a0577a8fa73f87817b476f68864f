WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#119: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usb_atm.h:32:
+/*
+#define DEBUG

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#130: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usb_atm.h:43:
+#define UDSL_ASSERT(x)	BUG_ON(!(x))

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns

+#define UDSL_ASSERT(x)	do { if (!(x)) warn("failed assertion '" #x "' at line %d", __LINE__); } while(0)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
