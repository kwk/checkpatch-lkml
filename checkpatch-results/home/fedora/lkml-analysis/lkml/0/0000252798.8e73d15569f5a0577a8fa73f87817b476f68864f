WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#126: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:219:
+	struct list_head mmlist;		/* List of maybe swapped mm's.  These are globally strung

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#242: FILE: mm/memory.c:293:
+						if (list_empty(&dst->mmlist)) {

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
