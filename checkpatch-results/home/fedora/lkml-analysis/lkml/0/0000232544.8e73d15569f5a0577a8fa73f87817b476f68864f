CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#61: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:792:
+extern int check_user_page_readable(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long address);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#94: FILE: mm/memory.c:810:
+follow_page(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long address, int write) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "__follow_page"
#102: FILE: mm/memory.c:818:
+	return __follow_page(mm, address, /*read*/1, /*write*/0) != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#105: FILE: mm/memory.c:821:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(check_user_page_readable);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
