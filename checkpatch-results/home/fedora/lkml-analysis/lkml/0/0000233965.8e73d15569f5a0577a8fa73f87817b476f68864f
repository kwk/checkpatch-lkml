ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"

+int driver_probe_device(struct device_driver * drv, struct device * dev,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
