#201: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c:546:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#296: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/head64.c:22:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
