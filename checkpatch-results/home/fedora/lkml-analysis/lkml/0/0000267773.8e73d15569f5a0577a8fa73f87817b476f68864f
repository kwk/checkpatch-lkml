Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#131: FILE: include/linux/time.h:351:
+extern void getnstimeofday (struct timespec *tv);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
