ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/fs/smbfs/proc.c	Tue Apr  8 09:36:43 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#65: FILE: fs/smbfs/proto.h:30:
+extern int smb_proc_setattr_unix(struct dentry *d, struct iattr *attr, unsigned int major, unsigned int minor);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: fs/smbfs/proto.h:30:
+extern int smb_proc_setattr_unix(struct dentry *d, struct iattr *attr, unsigned int major, unsigned int minor);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
