ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#82: 
--- a/drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c	2004-06-16 19:56:46 +02:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#119: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:163:
+				psmouse->nak = 0;	/* Workaround for mice which don't ACK the Get ID command */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#132: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:171:
+	if (test_bit(PSMOUSE_FLAG_CMD, &psmouse->flags)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#165: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:261:
+	while (test_bit(PSMOUSE_FLAG_ACK, &psmouse->flags) && timeout--) udelay(1);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#222: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:309:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#226: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:313:
+			if (command == PSMOUSE_CMD_GETID && !test_bit(PSMOUSE_FLAG_ID, &psmouse->flags)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#267: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:766:
+	psmouse->pktcnt = psmouse->out_of_sync = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
