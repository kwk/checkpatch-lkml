ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#37: 
--- a/fs/sysfs/dir.c	Thu Jul  3 18:15:51 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#43: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:124:
+void sysfs_rename_dir(struct kobject * kobj, char *new_name)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:STRLCPY: Prefer strscpy over strlcpy - see: https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAHk-=wgfRnXz0W3D37d01q3JFkr_i_uTL=V6A6G1oUZcprmknw@mail.gmail.com/

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#62: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:143:
+^Iup(&parent->d_inode->i_sem);^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct kobject *' should also have an identifier name
#76: FILE: include/linux/sysfs.h:42:
+extern void

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
