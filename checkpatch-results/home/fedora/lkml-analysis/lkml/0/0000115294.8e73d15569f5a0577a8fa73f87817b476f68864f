WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#161: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:777:
+		struct zone *zone = page_zone(page);
+		spin_lock_irq(&zone->lru_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#247: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:170:
+extern int lru_add_drain_all(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
