ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#123: FILE: net/sunrpc/clnt.c:801:
+	if (!(p = call_verify(task))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#188: FILE: net/sunrpc/xprt.c:585:
+^I       ^Iif (req->rq_ntrans == 1) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct rpc_clnt *' should also have an identifier name
#318: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/clnt.h:129:
+int		rpc_congestion_wait(struct rpc_clnt *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#323: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/clnt.h:134:
+	struct rpc_clnt *clnt = task->tk_client;
+	task->tk_active = 1;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#517: FILE: net/sunrpc/sched.c:1003:
+			if (likely(!rpciod_task_pending())) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
