CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:963:
+extern int cond_resched_softirq(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#86: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3594:
+	BUG_ON(!in_softirq());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#97: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3605:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(cond_resched_softirq);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#99: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3607:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
