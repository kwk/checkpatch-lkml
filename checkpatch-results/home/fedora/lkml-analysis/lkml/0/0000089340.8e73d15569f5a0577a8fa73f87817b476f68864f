+	    *(__be64 *) ifp->if_guid == __constant_cpu_to_be64(-1LL)) {

Use of __constant_<foo> form is discouraged for the following functions::

  __constant_cpu_to_be[x]
  __constant_cpu_to_le[x]
  __constant_be[x]_to_cpu
  __constant_le[x]_to_cpu
  __constant_htons
  __constant_ntohs

Using any of these outside of include/uapi/ is not preferred as using the
function without __constant_ is identical when the argument is a
constant.

In big endian systems, the macros like __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) and
cpu_to_be32(x) expand to the same expression::

  #define __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) ((__force __be32)(__u32)(x))
  #define __cpu_to_be32(x)          ((__force __be32)(__u32)(x))

In little endian systems, the macros __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) and
cpu_to_be32(x) expand to __constant_swab32 and __swab32.  __swab32
has a __builtin_constant_p check::

  #define __swab32(x)				\
    (__builtin_constant_p((__u32)(x)) ?	\
    ___constant_swab32(x) :			\
    __fswab32(x))

So ultimately they have a special case for constants.
Similar is the case with all of the macros in the list.  Thus
using the __constant_... forms are unnecessarily verbose and
not preferred outside of include/uapi.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

#1063: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_intr.c:395:
+				 (dd->ipath_maskederrs & ~dd->
+				  ipath_ignorederrs));

A single dereferencing identifier spanned on multiple lines like::

  struct_identifier->member[index].
  member = <foo>;

is generally hard to follow. It can easily lead to typos and so makes
the code vulnerable to bugs.

If fixing the multiple line dereferencing leads to an 80 column
violation, then either rewrite the code in a more simple way or if the
starting part of the dereferencing identifier is the same and used at
multiple places then store it in a temporary variable, and use that
temporary variable only at all the places. For example, if there are
two dereferencing identifiers::

  member1->member2->member3.foo1;
  member1->member2->member3.foo2;

then store the member1->member2->member3 part in a temporary variable.
It not only helps to avoid the 80 column violation but also reduces
the program size by removing the unnecessary dereferences.

But if none of the above methods work then ignore the 80 column
violation because it is much easier to read a dereferencing identifier
on a single line.
