ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#95: FILE: video/console/vgacon.c:57:
+static int cursor_size_lastfrom = 0, cursor_size_lastto = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'from == cursor_size_lastfrom'
#111: FILE: video/console/vgacon.c:419:
+	if ((from == cursor_size_lastfrom) && (to == cursor_size_lastto))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#137: FILE: video/console/vgacon.c:904:
+^I^I^I        /* void size to cause regs to be rewritten */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#138: FILE: video/console/vgacon.c:905:
+				cursor_size_lastfrom = cursor_size_lastto = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
