I think we should mark the i2c-philips-par, i2c-elv and i2c-velleman drivers as "deprecated" in i2c/busses/Kconfig. Is there a standard way to do so (like there is "&& EXPERIMENTAL" for new drivers)?

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
