WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'sonypi_camera_command', this function's name, in a string
#156: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:477:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "sonypi: sonypi_camera_command invalid: %d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

#186: FILE: drivers/media/video/meye.c:1845:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
