+static struct pcmcia_bus_socket * get_socket_info_by_nr(unsigned int nr);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*s)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct pcmcia_bus_socket)...)
#299: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/ds.c:915:
+	s = kmalloc(sizeof(struct pcmcia_bus_socket), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#312: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/ds.c:1012:
+		struct pcmcia_bus_socket *bus_sock = container_of(list_loop, struct pcmcia_bus_socket, socket_list);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
