CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*sc)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct uea_softc)...)
#199: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/ueagle-atm.c:1340:
+	sc = kzalloc(sizeof(struct uea_softc), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
