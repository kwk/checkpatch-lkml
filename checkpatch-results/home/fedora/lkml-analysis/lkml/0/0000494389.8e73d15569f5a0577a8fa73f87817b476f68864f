ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#108: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:140:
+		if ((error = walk(gp, data)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#115: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:147:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(walk_gendisk);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:96:
+extern int walk_gendisk(int (*walk)(struct gendisk *, void *), void *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#128: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:96:
+extern int walk_gendisk(int (*walk)(struct gendisk *, void *), void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
