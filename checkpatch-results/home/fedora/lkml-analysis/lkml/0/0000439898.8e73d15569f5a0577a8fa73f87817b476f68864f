`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#70: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:749:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

 		                ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#71: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:750:
+		align = size = 4*1024*1024;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#77: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:755:
 		
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#79: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:757:
+	/* We check if we are behind a transparent PCI bridge. If yes,
+	   we just allocate resources from its parent.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
