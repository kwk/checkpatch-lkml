should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#267: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs.h:304:
+extern void fat_fs_panic(struct super_block *s, const char *fmt, ...);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
