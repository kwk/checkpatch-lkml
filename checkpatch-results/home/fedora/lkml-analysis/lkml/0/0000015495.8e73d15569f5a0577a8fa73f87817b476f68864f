WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#90: FILE: drivers/acpi/video.c:1514:
+	int min, max, min_above, max_below, i, l;
+	max = max_below = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: drivers/acpi/video.c:1514:
+	max = max_below = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#94: FILE: drivers/acpi/video.c:1518:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
