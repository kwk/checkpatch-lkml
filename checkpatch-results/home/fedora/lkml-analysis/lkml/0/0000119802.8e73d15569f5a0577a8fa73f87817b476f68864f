ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#86: FILE: init/main.c:562:
+unsigned int boot_delay = 0; /* msecs delay after each printk during bootup */

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#87: FILE: init/main.c:563:
+extern long preset_lpj;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
