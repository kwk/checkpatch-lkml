CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#83: FILE: mm/memory.c:1416:
+	pageable = ram = pfn_valid(page_to_pfn(new_page));

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#88: FILE: mm/memory.c:1421:
+		BUG_ON(!pageable && as);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
