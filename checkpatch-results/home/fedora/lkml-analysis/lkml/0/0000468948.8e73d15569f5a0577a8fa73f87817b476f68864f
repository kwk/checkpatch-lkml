ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - void do_softirq() should probably be void do_softirq(void)
#33: FILE: ppp_deflate.c:45:
+extern asmlinkage void do_softirq();

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#33: FILE: ppp_deflate.c:45:
+extern asmlinkage void do_softirq();

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
