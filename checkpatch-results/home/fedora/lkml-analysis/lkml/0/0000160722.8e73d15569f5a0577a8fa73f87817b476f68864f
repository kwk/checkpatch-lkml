Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'adjustement' may be misspelled - perhaps 'adjustment'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'interval >= MINSEC'
#107: FILE: kernel/ntp.c:285:
+	if ((time_status & STA_FLL) && (interval >= MINSEC)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#135: FILE: kernel/ntp.c:313:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
