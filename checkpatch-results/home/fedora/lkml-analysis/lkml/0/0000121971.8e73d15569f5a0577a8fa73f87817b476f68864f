WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct task_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#146: FILE: include/asm-i386/vm86.h:213:
+void release_vm86_irqs(struct task_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#153: FILE: include/asm-i386/vm86.h:220:
+static inline int handle_vm86_trap(struct kernel_vm86_regs *a, long b, int c) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
