ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#92: FILE: drivers/net/acenic.c:52:
#include <linux/config.h>

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#124: FILE: drivers/net/acenic.c:2649:
while (test_and_set_bit(0, &ap->jumbo_refill_busy));
+		synchronize_irq(dev->irq);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 203 exceeds 100 columns

+#if (defined(__i386__) && defined(CONFIG_HIGHMEM)) || defined(__x86_64__) || defined (__ia64__) || defined(__mips64__) || (defined(__mips__) && defined(CONFIG_HIGHMEM) && defined(CONFIG_64BIT_PHYS_ADDR))

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
