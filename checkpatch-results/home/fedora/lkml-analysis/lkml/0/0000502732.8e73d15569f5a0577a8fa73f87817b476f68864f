ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#125: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:128:
+^I             + init_tasks[0]->times.tms_stime);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#289: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:552:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
