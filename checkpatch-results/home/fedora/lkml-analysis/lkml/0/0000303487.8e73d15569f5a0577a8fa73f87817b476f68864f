WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#39: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:141:
+extern int radeonfb_old_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#40: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:142:
+extern int radeonfb_old_setup(char*);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char*' should also have an identifier name
#40: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:142:
+extern int radeonfb_old_setup(char*);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
