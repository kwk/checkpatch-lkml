WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+					if(pDev->next_lun == NULL) {

 					}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pDev->next_lun"
#51: FILE: drivers/scsi/dpt_i2o.c:1501:
+					if(pDev->next_lun == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
