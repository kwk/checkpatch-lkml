CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#107: FILE: include/linux/mempolicy.h:158:
+extern void numa_policy_rebind(const nodemask_t *old, const nodemask_t *new);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#116: FILE: include/linux/mempolicy.h:232:
+static inline void numa_policy_rebind(const nodemask_t *old,
+					const nodemask_t *new)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#167: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1212:
+static void rebind_policy(struct mempolicy *pol, const nodemask_t *old,
+							const nodemask_t *new)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#184: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1229:
+		pol->v.preferred_node = node_remap(pol->v.preferred_node,

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#201: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1246:
+		 * then zonelist_policy() will "FALL THROUGH" to MPOL_DEFAULT.

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#212: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1257:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
