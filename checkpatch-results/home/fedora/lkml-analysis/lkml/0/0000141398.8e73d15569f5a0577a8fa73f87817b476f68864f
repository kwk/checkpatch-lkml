WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#109: FILE: include/linux/mm_inline.h:86:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#268: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:719:
+	struct page * page;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#311: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:179:
+extern int isolate_lru_page(struct page *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
