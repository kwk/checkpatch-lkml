Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#44: 
#define BIO_MAX_PAGES           (256)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#60: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:29:
+#define DIO_BIO_MAX_SIZE (16*1024)
