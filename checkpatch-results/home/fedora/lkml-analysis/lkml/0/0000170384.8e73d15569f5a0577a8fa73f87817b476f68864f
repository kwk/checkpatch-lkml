WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#31: FILE: kernel/power/suspend.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#32: FILE: kernel/power/suspend.h:2:
+ * kernel/power/suspend.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#46: FILE: kernel/power/suspend.h:16:
+   $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: kernel/power/suspend.h:18:
+extern void drain_local_pages(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
