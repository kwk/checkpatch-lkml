ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#131: FILE: net/core/rtnetlink.c:223:
+static int do_setlink(struct sk_buff *skb, struct nlmsghdr *nlh, void *arg) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#138: FILE: net/core/rtnetlink.c:230:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
