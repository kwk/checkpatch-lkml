ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#63: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1394:
+static int ext3_direct_IO(int rw, struct inode * inode, struct kiobuf *

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#64: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1394:
iobuf, unsigned long blocknr, int blocksize)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#76: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1406:
+	if (rw == WRITE) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#104: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1433:

+			if (end > inode->i_size) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#108: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1437:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#108: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:1437:
+				/*
+			 	* We're going to return a positive `ret'

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
