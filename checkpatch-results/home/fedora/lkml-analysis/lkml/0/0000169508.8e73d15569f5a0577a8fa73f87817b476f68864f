# Original is at linux-pm ML. Cross posting...

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#257: FILE: arch/arm/power/cpu.c:37:
+#include <asm/uaccess.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#262: FILE: arch/arm/power/cpu.c:42:
+extern void enable_sep_cpu(void *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#262: FILE: arch/arm/power/cpu.c:42:
+extern void enable_sep_cpu(void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#284: FILE: arch/arm/power/cpu.c:64:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
