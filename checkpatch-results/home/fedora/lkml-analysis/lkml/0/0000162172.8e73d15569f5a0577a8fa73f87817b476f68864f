WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#51: FILE: fs/relayfs/buffers.c:140:
+	buf->padding = kmalloc(chan->n_subbufs * sizeof(size_t *), GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#269: FILE: include/linux/relayfs_fs.h:143:
+extern size_t relay_switch_subbuf(struct rchan_buf *buf,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
