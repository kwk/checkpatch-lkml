WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#165: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:218:
+	BUG_ON(!list_empty(&pd->cdrw.pkt_free_list));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
