CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#137: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:656:
+	cnx->reset_timer.data = (unsigned long) cnx;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#148: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:966:
+	if (0 == cnx->outstanding_tx)

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#168: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:1123:
+	 * execute it after the module's been unloaded. Hmm. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:JIFFIES_COMPARISON: Comparing jiffies is almost always wrong; prefer time_after, time_before and friends
#175: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:1130:
+		if (trigger_time < jiffies) {

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#179: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:1134:
+			veth_error("%d packets not acked by LPAR %d within %d "
+					"seconds, resetting.\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
