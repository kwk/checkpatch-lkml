The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while loop
#298: FILE: kernel/synchro-test.c:108:
+#define ACCOUNT(var, N) var##_taken[N]++;

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#298: FILE: kernel/synchro-test.c:108:
+#define ACCOUNT(var, N) var##_taken[N]++;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#679: FILE: kernel/synchro-test.c:489:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
