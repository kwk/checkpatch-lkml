CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: include/linux/netfilter_ipv4/ip_tables.h:460:
+extern struct ipt_target *ipt_find_target(const char *name, u8 revision);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#114: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c:449:
+			} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#264: FILE: net/sched/ipt.c:230:
+	if (NULL != p) {

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#266: FILE: net/sched/ipt.c:232:
+		struct ipt_entry_target *t = p->t;
+		if (t && t->u.kernel.target)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
