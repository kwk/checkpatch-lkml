CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#87: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:437:
 {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 132 exceeds 100 columns
#100: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:450:
+#if defined(CONFIG_CPU_486) || defined(CONFIG_CPU_586) || defined(CONFIG_CPU_K6) || defined(CONFIG_CPU_K7) || defined(CONFIG_CPU_K8)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
