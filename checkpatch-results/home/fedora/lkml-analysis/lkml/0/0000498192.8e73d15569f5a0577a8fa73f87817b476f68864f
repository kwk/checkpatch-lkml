CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:553:
+	extern u64 get_jiffies64(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#74: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:562:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#110: FILE: kernel/timer.c:696:
+	static unsigned long jiffies_hi = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
