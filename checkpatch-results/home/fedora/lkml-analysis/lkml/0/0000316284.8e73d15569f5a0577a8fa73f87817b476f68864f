Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#62: 
# echo 'clear' > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#79: FILE: sound/core/oss/pcm_oss.c:817:
+				tmp = snd_pcm_oss_write2(substream, runtime->oss.buffer, runtime->oss.period_bytes, 1);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
