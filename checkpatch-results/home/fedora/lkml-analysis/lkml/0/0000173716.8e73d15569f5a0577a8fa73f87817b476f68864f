WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#75: FILE: mm/rmap.c:453:
+		BUG_ON(!anon_vma);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#76: FILE: mm/rmap.c:454:
+		anon_vma = (void *) anon_vma + PAGE_MAPPING_ANON;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
