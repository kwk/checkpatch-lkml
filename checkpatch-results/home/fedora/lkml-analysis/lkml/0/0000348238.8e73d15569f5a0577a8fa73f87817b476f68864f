ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#54: 
--- a/arch/i386/Kconfig	2003-08-05 18:39:25.000000000 +0200

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#220: FILE: kernel/Kconfig.swsusp:1:
+config SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
+	bool "Software Suspend (EXPERIMENTAL)"
+	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PM && SWAP
+	---help---
+	  Enable the possibility of suspending the machine.  This feature
+	  doesn't require APM.  You may suspend your machine by 'swsusp'
+	  or 'shutdown -z <time>' (with the appropriate patch for sysvinit).
+
+	  The suspend procedure will create an image that is saved in one
+	  of your active swap partitions (swap files are not supported).
+
+	  On the next boot, passing the kernel boot option
+	  'resume=/path/to/your/swap/partition' will cause the kernel
+	  to detect the saved image, restore system memory from it and
+	  then continue to run as before you suspended.  If you don't
+	  want the previous state restored, use the 'noresume' kernel
+	  boot option.  However, note that in this case your partitions
+	  will appear to be damaged and you will need to re-mkswap.
+
+	  You are not advised to boot without resuming and then resume
+	  later.  There is a high probability that buffers on disk won't
+	  match with the saved ones.
+
+	  SMP is NOT supported at this time.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
