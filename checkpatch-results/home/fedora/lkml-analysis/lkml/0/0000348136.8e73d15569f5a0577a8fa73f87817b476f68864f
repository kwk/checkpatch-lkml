WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#71: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:461:
+/* Deprecated function to silence the NMI watchdog for long waits.
+   Better fix the driver instead of using this. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'driver_touch_watchdog', this function's name, in a string
#76: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:466:
+		print_symbol(KERN_ERR "Function %s uses driver_touch_watchdog.\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
