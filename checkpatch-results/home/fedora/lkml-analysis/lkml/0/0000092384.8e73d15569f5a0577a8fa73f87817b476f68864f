Fix is to accept references from all sections that includes "unwind." in the name.

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#55: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:675:
+	const char *namelist3 [] = {

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^Ifor (s = namelist3; *s; s++)^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "strstr"
#67: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:687:
+		if (strstr(*s, name) != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
