ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#64: FILE: include/linux/timer.h:91:
+  extern int del_singleshot_timer_sync(struct timer_list * timer);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#64: FILE: include/linux/timer.h:91:
+  extern int del_singleshot_timer_sync(struct timer_list * timer);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#100: FILE: kernel/timer.c:375:
+		BUG_ON(ret);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#106: FILE: kernel/timer.c:381:

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
