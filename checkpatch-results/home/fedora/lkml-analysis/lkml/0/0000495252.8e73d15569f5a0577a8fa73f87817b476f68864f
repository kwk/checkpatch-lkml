ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#89: FILE: fs/devfs/base.c:3255:
+	for (; de != NULL; de = parent)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "de"
#89: FILE: fs/devfs/base.c:3255:
+	for (; de != NULL; de = parent)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
