Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#61: FILE: arch/um/drivers/net_kern.c:155:
+	if(lp->close != NULL) (*lp->close)(lp->fd, &lp->user);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "lp->close"
#61: FILE: arch/um/drivers/net_kern.c:155:
+	if(lp->close != NULL) (*lp->close)(lp->fd, &lp->user);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
