The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#50: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_numtasks.c:1:
+/* ckrm_numtasks.c - "Number of tasks" resource controller for CKRM

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*res)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ckrm_numtasks)...)
#99: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_numtasks.c:50:
+	res = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ckrm_numtasks), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#133: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_numtasks.c:84:
+	int rc;
+	do {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#136: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_numtasks.c:87:
+	BUG_ON(rc != 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
