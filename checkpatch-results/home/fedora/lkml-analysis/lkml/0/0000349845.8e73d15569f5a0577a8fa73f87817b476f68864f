ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#35: 
--- a/drivers/char/watchdog/acquirewdt.c	Wed Jul 30 20:53:31 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#289: FILE: drivers/char/watchdog/shwdt.c:2:
+ * drivers/char/watchdog/shwdt.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
