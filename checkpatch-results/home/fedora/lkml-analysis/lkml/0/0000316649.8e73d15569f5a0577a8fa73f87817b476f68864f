The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
