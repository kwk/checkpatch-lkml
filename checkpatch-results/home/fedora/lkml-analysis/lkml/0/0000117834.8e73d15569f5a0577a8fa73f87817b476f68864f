ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#43: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_mc.c:56:
+static int check_pci_parity = 0;	/* default NO check PCI parity */

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#53: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_mc.c:1760:
+	/* If we get back 0xFFFF then we must suspect that the card has been pulled but
+	   the Linux PCI layer has not yet finished cleaning up. We don't want to report

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
