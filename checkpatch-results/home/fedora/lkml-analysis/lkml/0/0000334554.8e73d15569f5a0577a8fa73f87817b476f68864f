--- a/drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c	Thu Sep 25 18:36:58 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#58: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:536:
+	if (hw.z > 30) input_report_key(dev, BTN_TOUCH, 1);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#74: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:87:
+	if (test_bit(BTN_TOOL_FINGER, handle->dev->keybit)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#78: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:91:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#155: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:151:
+							if (test_bit(BTN_TOOL_FINGER, handle->dev->keybit)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#155: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:151:
+							if (test_bit(BTN_TOOL_FINGER, handle->dev->keybit)) {

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
