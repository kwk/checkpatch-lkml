WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#100: FILE: ams.c:239:
+	ams.idev->dev = &ams.client.dev;

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#142: FILE: ams.c:478:
+	if ((ams.of_dev = of_platform_device_create(np, "ams", NULL)) == NULL) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
