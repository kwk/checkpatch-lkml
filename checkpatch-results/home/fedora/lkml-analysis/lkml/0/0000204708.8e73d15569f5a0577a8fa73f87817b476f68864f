+static int i2c_stop_timer(struct i2c_adapter * adap);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
