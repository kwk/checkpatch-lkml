WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#160: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:207:
+/**
+  * Return a copy of the next line in a mmap'ed file.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#164: FILE: scripts/mod/modpost.c:211:
+char* get_next_line(unsigned long *pos, void *file, unsigned long size)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
