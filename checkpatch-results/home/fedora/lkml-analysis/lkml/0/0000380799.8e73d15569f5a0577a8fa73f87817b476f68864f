ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#86: FILE: shmem.c:1639:
+				if(*rest == '+') {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#88: FILE: shmem.c:1641:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#117: FILE: shmem.c:1730:
+	blocks = inodes = totalram_pages / 2;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
