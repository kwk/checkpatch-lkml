#27: 
We have been working with MIPL to further split the patch as you had suggested. The patch I am sending breaks this into Correspondent Node, Mobile Node and Home Agent functionalities. This patch is against 2.5.45. As part of integrating with 2.5.45 as well as due to the splitting done, there is one outstanding issue with the patch : at module unload time, some memory allocated during module_init is not freed up. However this is a small issue and we are confident of submitting a patch in a couple of days to fix this. The code base is the same that was submitted a few days ago, so the only new thing is the further splitting work and integrating with 2.5.45.
