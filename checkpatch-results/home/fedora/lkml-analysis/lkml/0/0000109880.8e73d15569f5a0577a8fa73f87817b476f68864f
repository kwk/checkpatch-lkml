#28: 
"make mandocs" complains on fs/inode.c because touch_atime() has an undescribed paramter. This patch silences the complaint by describing the param. Also update the kernel-doc entry to reflect dentry usage over raw inode access.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'paramter' may be misspelled - perhaps 'parameter'?
