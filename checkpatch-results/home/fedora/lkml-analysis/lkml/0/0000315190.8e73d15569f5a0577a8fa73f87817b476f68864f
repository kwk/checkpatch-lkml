CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#32: FILE: drivers/scsi/NCR53C9x.h:655:
+extern void esp_cmd(struct NCR_ESP *esp, struct ESP_regs *eregs, unchar cmd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#43: FILE: drivers/scsi/mac_esp.c:49:
+extern void esp_handle(struct NCR_ESP *esp);
