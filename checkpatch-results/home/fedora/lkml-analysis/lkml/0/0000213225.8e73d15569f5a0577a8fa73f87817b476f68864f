ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#27: 
--- a/drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c	2005-01-21 23:41:14 +01:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:NEW_TYPEDEFS: do not add new typedefs

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#131: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:1942:
+	if (!(floppy = ide_floppy_get(disk)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#230: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:2103:

+	set_capacity(disk, idefloppy_capacity(floppy->drive));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
