WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#80: FILE: drivers/infiniband/core/smi.c:41:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#135: FILE: drivers/infiniband/core/smi.c:96:
+		if (2 <= hop_ptr && hop_ptr <= hop_cnt) {

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#188: FILE: drivers/infiniband/core/smi.c:149:
+			return (smp->initial_path[hop_ptr+1] <= phys_port_cnt);
 			                                 ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#206: FILE: drivers/infiniband/core/smi.c:167:
+	} else {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
