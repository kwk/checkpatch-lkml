ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#96: FILE: net/ipv6/ip6_flowlabel.c:228:
+	struct ipv6_txoptions * fl_opt = fl->opt;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!fopt"
#98: FILE: net/ipv6/ip6_flowlabel.c:230:
+	if (fopt == NULL || fopt->opt_flen == 0)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
