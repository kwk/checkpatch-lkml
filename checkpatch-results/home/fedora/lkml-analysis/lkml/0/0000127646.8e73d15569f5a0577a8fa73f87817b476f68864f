WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#72: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cs5535.c:1:
+/**

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#73: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cs5535.c:2:
+ * linux/arch/i386/kernel/cs5535.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#92: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cs5535.c:21:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#94: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cs5535.c:23:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#126: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cs5535.c:55:

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.

#127: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cs5535.c:56:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'high32 != 0'

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
