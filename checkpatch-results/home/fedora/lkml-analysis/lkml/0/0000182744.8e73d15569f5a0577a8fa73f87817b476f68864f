WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#94: 
driver core convention to return '0' on success and an error code otherwise.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#151: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:471:
+			pr_debug("bus %s: attach device %s failed with %d\n", bus->name, dev->bus_id, error);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
