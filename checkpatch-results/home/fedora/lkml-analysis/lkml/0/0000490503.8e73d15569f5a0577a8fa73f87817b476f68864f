#28: 
Hello. I would like to formally introduce myself to this list, as this is my first post. Of course, I would not come to the table empty handed.. I bring to you a patch ;)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'compatable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'compatible'?
#34: 
I may be looking at this and the multi-device drivers in the near future as I have a need for support for partitions on these devices; I think it would be really neat if the software-raid could eventually become compatable with hardware raid.. although much slower, it may be a nice thing to have for testing purposes or a last resort for those who fry their hardware raid-controllers ;)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^
