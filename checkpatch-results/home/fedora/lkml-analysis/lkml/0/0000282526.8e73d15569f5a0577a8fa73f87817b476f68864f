WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#43: FILE: security/commoncap.c:61:
+	if (!cap_issubset (*inheritable, target->cap_inheritable)) {
 		return -EPERM;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

#176: FILE: security/commoncap.c:174:
+^I        current->suid = current->euid = current->fsuid = bprm->set_uid;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#176: FILE: security/commoncap.c:174:
+	        current->suid = current->euid = current->fsuid = bprm->set_uid;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
