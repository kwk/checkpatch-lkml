#81: 
> jiffies_64_to_clock_t() takes and returns a u64, not an unsigned long long.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'guarenteed' may be misspelled - perhaps 'guaranteed'?

guarenteed to be at least 64 bits by the C99 standard.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#227: FILE: include/linux/kernel_stat.h:37:
+extern unsigned long long nr_context_switches(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
