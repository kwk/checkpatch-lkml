#39: FILE: include/linux/should_fail.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_SHOULD_FAIL_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>

+#include <asm/atomic.h>

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#48: FILE: include/linux/should_fail.h:10:
+struct should_fail_data {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
