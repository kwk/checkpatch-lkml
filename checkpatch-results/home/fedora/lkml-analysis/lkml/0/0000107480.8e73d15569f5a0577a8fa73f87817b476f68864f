WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#80: FILE: fs/lockd/svc.c:48:
+static struct task_struct *	nlmsvc_task;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#132: FILE: fs/lockd/svc.c:295:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "lockd_down: no users! pid=%d\n", nlmsvc_task->pid);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'lockd_down', this function's name, in a string
#132: FILE: fs/lockd/svc.c:295:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "lockd_down: no users! pid=%d\n", nlmsvc_task->pid);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
