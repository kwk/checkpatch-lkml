Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#107: FILE: drivers/net/3c59x.c:2088:
+		if (tx_status & 0x08)  vp->xstats.tx_max_collisions++;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
