WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#144: FILE: drivers/scsi/53c700.c:316:
+	BUG_ON(!dma_is_consistent(hostdata->dev, pScript) && L1_CACHE_BYTES < dma_get_cache_alignment());

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#144: FILE: drivers/scsi/53c700.c:316:
+	BUG_ON(!dma_is_consistent(hostdata->dev, pScript) && L1_CACHE_BYTES < dma_get_cache_alignment());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <pScript>
#144: FILE: drivers/scsi/53c700.c:316:
+	BUG_ON(!dma_is_consistent(hostdata->dev, pScript) && L1_CACHE_BYTES < dma_get_cache_alignment());

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#273: FILE: include/asm-mips/dma-mapping.h:66:
+extern int dma_is_consistent(struct device *dev, dma_addr_t dma_addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
