WARNING:ENOTSUPP: ENOTSUPP is not a SUSV4 error code, prefer EOPNOTSUPP
#85: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsproc.c:596:
+		{ nfserr_notsupp, -ENOTSUPP },

ENOTSUPP is not a standard error code and should be avoided in new patches.
EOPNOTSUPP should be used instead.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20200510182252.GA411829@lunn.ch/

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#116: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/svc.h:231:
+	struct svc_program *	pg_next;	/* other programs */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#128: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/xprt.h:152:
+	unsigned int		clients;	/* Number of clients using
+						   this transport */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#159: FILE: net/sunrpc/clnt.c:946:
+		rpc_exit(task, -ENOSYS);

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!progp"
#180: FILE: net/sunrpc/svc.c:325:
+	if (progp == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#190: FILE: net/sunrpc/svc.c:438:
