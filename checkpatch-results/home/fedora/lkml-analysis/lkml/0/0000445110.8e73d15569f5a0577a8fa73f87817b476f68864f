CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:605:
+extern int do_munmap(struct mm_struct *, unsigned long, size_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct mm_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#76: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:605:
+extern int do_munmap(struct mm_struct *, unsigned long, size_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#93: FILE: include/linux/mman.h:16:
+	extern int sysctl_overcommit_memory;
+	return sysctl_overcommit_memory > 1;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

 		                                 ^

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'do_munmap', this function's name, in a string
#191: FILE: mm/mmap.c:1071:
+	vm_validate_enough("entering do_munmap");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
