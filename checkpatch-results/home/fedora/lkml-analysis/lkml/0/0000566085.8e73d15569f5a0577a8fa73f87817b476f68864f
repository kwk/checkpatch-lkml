#23: 
Hello all. I've seen a problem with the VESA framebuffer console using ywrap

actually is. I therefore went ahead and modified the VESA frambuffer code to

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
