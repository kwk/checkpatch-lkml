#33: 
This patch makes the suspend code SMP clean by removing PF_FREEZE and PF_FROZEN. Instead

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns

+			/* If there is nothing on the todo list then get the process to freeze itself */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*n)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct notifier_block)...)
#135: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:92:
+				n = kmalloc(sizeof(struct notifier_block), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#141: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:98:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
