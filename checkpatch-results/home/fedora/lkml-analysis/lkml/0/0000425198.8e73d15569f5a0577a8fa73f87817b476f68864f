  driver model: and present field to struct device and implement device_unregister().

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/drivers/base/core.c	Tue Oct  8 17:55:22 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#67: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:244:
+	struct device * parent;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#74: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:251:
+	BUG_ON(dev->present);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#135: FILE: include/linux/device.h:331:
+extern void device_unregister(struct device * dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
