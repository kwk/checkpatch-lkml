againts 2.4.19-pre10 and I have tested it on three different boxes.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#44: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp.c:31:
+ *  2002-06-06  Made the use of dma channel 0 configurable $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 126 exceeds 100 columns
#53: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp.c:64:
+int isapnp_allow_dma0 = -1;		/* allow dma 0 during auto activation: -1=off (:default), 0=off (set by user), 1=on */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:WxV)
#71: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp.c:1758:
+	int i, mindma =1;
 	              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#98: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp_proc.c:955:
+	i = simple_strtoul(value, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#100: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp_proc.c:957:
