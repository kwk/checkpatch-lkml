Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#481: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:121:
+static void via_set_speed(ide_hwif_t *hwif, u8 dn, struct ide_timing *timing)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#562: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:249:
+		if ((*isa = pci_find_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA +

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#565: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:252:
+			via_config->id, NULL))) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#739: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:418:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
