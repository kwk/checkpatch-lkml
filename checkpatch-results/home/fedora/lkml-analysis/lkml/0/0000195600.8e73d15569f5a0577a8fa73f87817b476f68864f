CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#75: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:277:
+			low_count = (unsigned long) high_memory - p;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#83: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:283:
+			if (tmp > low_count) tmp = low_count;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#130: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:345:
+ ^Ireturn read;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
