#29: 
starvation problems as we saw with xtime.  This patch changes it to seq_lock

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#33: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_tsc.c	Mon Sep 15 15:48:01 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
