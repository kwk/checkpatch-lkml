CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#643: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1879:
+extern void inode_drop_nlink(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#655: FILE: ipc/mqueue.c:310:
+  ^Iinode_drop_nlink(inode);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#655: FILE: ipc/mqueue.c:310:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
