CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#101: FILE: lib/inflate.c:1007:
+	io.opos = io.bits = io.buf = io.ipos = io.itotal = io.ototal = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'gunzip', this function's name, in a string
#117: FILE: lib/inflate.c:1072:
+		error("couldn't allocate gunzip window\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
