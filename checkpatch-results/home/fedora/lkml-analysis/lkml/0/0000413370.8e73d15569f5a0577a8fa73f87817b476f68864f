ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#28: 
--- a/include/linux/string.h	Sat Oct  5 18:42:33 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#35: FILE: include/linux/string.h:18:
+extern char *strdup(const char *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const char *' should also have an identifier name
#35: FILE: include/linux/string.h:18:
+extern char *strdup(const char *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#75: FILE: lib/string.c:493:
+	char *p = kmalloc(strlen(s) + 1, GFP_KERNEL);
+	if (p)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
