WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#74: 
#include <unistd.h>

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
