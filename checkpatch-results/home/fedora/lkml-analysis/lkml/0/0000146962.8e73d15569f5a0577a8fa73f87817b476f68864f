WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Non-standard signature: 'Sigend-off-by:' - perhaps 'Signed-off-by:'?
#41: 
Sigend-off-by: Chris Wright <chrisw@osdl.org>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#57: FILE: drivers/net/skge.c:2832:

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#76: FILE: drivers/net/skge.c:2845:
+	if (hw->chip_id == CHIP_ID_GENESIS)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
