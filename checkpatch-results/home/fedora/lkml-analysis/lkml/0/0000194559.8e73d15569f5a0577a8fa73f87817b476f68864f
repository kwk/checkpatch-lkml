#41: 
> Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000068

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment
#78: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serport.c:38:
+	spinlock_t lock;

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#98: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serport.c:64:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#161: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serport.c:110:
+	struct serport *serport = (struct serport *) tty->disc_data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#196: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serport.c:168:
+	serport->serio = serio = kcalloc(1, sizeof(struct serio), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:STRLCPY: Prefer strscpy over strlcpy - see: https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAHk-=wgfRnXz0W3D37d01q3JFkr_i_uTL=V6A6G1oUZcprmknw@mail.gmail.com/
#200: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serport.c:172:
+	strlcpy(serio->name, "Serial port", sizeof(serio->name));

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#246: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serport.c:219:
+	struct serport *serport = (struct serport *) tty->disc_data;
