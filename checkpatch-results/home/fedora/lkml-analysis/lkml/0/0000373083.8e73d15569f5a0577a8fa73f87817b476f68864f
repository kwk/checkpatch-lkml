Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#77: FILE: usr/src/linux/drivers/char/Config.in:176:
CONFIG_DISABLE_TRACKPAD_WHILE_TYPING

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

#109: FILE: usr/src/linux/drivers/char/pc_keyb.c:78:
+static int last_kbd_event = 0; /* used to hold timestamp of last kbd 
+#endif

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#128: FILE: usr/src/linux/drivers/char/pc_keyb.c:465:
+        if ( abs(jiffies - last_kbd_event) < HZ ) return;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#141: FILE: usr/src/linux/drivers/char/pc_keyb.c:489:
  {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
