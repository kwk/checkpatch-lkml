WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'wont' may be misspelled - perhaps 'won't'?
#32: 
thread wont go away (call pthread_exit()) before the signal is delivered -
       ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#78: FILE: kernel/signal.c:574:
+static int check_kill_permission(int sig, struct siginfo *info,
 					struct task_struct *t)

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p->tgid == tgid'
#108: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1962:
+	if (p && (!tgid || (p->tgid == tgid))) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#121: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1984:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
