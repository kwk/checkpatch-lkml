#24: 
#endif statements and labels at the end of compound statements when using gcc 

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

#50: FILE: drivers/atm/fore200e.c:440:
+    case FORE200E_STATE_BLANK:;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#62: FILE: drivers/cdrom/sbpcd.c:1120:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open brace '{'
#78: FILE: drivers/i2o/i2o_core.c:383:
+	if (c->devices != NULL){

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#78: FILE: drivers/i2o/i2o_core.c:383:
+	if (c->devices != NULL){
 		c->devices->prev=d;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "c->devices"
#78: FILE: drivers/i2o/i2o_core.c:383:
+	if (c->devices != NULL){

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

switch default case is sometimes written as "default:;".  This can
cause new cases added below default to be defective.

A "break;" should be added after empty default statement to avoid
unwanted fallthrough.
