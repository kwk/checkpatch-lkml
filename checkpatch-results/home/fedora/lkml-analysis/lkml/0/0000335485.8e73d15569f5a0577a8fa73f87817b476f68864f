#28: 
1. move timer initialization into nr_init_timers so that we can use mod_timer

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#47: FILE: net/netrom/af_netrom.c:65:
+void nr_init_timers(struct sock *sk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
