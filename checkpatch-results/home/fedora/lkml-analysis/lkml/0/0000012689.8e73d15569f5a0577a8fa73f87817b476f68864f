Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#49: FILE: include/asm-s390/kexec.h:29:
+#define KEXEC_CONTROL_MEMORY_LIMIT (1UL<<31)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
