WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#76: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:304:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxW)
#92: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:331:
+		brightness= brightness << HCI_LCD_BRIGHTNESS_SHIFT;
 		          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#106: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:345:
+	int value = bd->props->brightness;
+	return tosh_set_brightness(value);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#130: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:594:

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#134: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:598:

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#145: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:612:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
