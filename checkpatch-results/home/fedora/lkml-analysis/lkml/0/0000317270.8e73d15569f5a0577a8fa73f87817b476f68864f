Mark --ignoremerge deprecated, point towards bk changes -d'$unless(:MERGE:)' instead.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
