CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#71: FILE: drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c:301:
+	rq->buffer = (void *) failed_command;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#95: FILE: drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c:540:
+		ide_execute_command(drive, WIN_PACKETCMD, &idescsi_transfer_pc, get_timeout(pc), NULL);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#108: FILE: drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c:786:
+	struct Scsi_Host *host  = cmd->device->host;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
