# Enhance bio_(un)map_user() and add blk_rq_bio_prep().

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

#54: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:2286:
+	rq->hard_nr_sectors = rq->nr_sectors = bio_sectors(bio);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#250: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:435:
+extern void blk_rq_bio_prep(request_queue_t *, struct request *, struct bio *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'request_queue_t *' should also have an identifier name
#250: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:435:
+extern void blk_rq_bio_prep(request_queue_t *, struct request *, struct bio *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
