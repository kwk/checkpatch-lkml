Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
