#20: 
Here's the follow-up patch which introduces the prototypes for the new syscalls.  There was also a typo in one of the new symbols.  Do we really need the __NR_ia32_* macros?  The userlevel on x86-64 should be bi-arch and provide the native ia32 unistd.h.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#45: FILE: include/linux/syscalls.h:537:
+asmlinkage long sys_mknodat(int dfd, const char __user * filename, int mode,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
