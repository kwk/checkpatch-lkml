#31: 
Description: Fix infinite recursion when alignment passed is 0 in function aligned_kmalloc(), in file drivers/atm/firestream.c. Also, a negative value for alignment does not make sense. Check for negative value too.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#47: FILE: drivers/atm/firestream.c:1388:
+		if ((unsigned long)t & ((alignment <= 0) ? 0 : (alignment-1))) {
 		                                                         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'alignment <= 0'
#47: FILE: drivers/atm/firestream.c:1388:
+		if ((unsigned long)t & ((alignment <= 0) ? 0 : (alignment-1))) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
