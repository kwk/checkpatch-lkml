WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#47: FILE: include/linux/stdlib.h:1:
+#ifndef __STDLIB_H__

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#50: FILE: include/linux/stdlib.h:4:
+extern int abs (int i);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: include/linux/stdlib.h:4:
+extern int abs (int i);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
