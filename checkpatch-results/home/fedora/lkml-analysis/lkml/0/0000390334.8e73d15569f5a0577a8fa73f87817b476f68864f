The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
