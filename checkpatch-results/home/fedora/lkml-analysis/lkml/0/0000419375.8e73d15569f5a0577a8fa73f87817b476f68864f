EXPS/2 protocol, specificly dealing with the wheel.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#86: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:120:
+						case REL_HWHEEL: if (list->mode =3D=3D 2) list->dw -=3D value; break;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#86: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:120:
+						case REL_HWHEEL: if (list->mode =3D=3D 2) list->dw -=3D value; break;

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
