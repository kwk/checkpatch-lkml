#27: 
Here is a fairly rapid evolution of the O*int patches for interactivity thanks

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#120: FILE: kernel/sched.c:367:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#121: FILE: kernel/sched.c:368:
+		else {
+

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#137: FILE: kernel/sched.c:384:
+
+}

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#139: FILE: kernel/sched.c:386:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
