ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!task->tk_action"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
