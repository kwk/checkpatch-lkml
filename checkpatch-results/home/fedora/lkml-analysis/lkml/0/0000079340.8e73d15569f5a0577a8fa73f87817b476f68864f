ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#130: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2139:
+ ^Iif (system_state < SYSTEM_RUNNING) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#130: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2139:
+ ^Iif (system_state < SYSTEM_RUNNING) {$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#130: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2139:
+ ^Iif (system_state < SYSTEM_RUNNING) {$

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#154: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1480:
+		BUG_ON(system_state < SYSTEM_RUNNING);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
