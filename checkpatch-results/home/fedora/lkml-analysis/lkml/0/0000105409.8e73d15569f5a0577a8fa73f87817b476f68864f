Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#322: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_int.h:274:
+	int (*ioctl) (struct dasd_device *, unsigned int, void __user *);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dasd_device *' should also have an identifier name
#322: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_int.h:274:
+	int (*ioctl) (struct dasd_device *, unsigned int, void __user *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name
#322: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_int.h:274:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
