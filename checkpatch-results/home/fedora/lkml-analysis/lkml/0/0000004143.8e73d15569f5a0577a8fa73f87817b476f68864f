WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#63: FILE: arch/um/kernel/physmem.c:401:
+extern int __init parse_iomem(char *str, int *add);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#66: FILE: arch/um/kernel/physmem.c:404:
+__uml_setup("iomem=", parse_iomem,
+"iomem=<name>,<file>\n"

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'in'
#71: FILE: arch/um/kernel/physmem.c:409:
+ * This list is constructed in parse_iomem and addresses filled in in

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#75: FILE: arch/um/kernel/physmem.c:413:
+struct iomem_region *iomem_regions = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#78: FILE: arch/um/kernel/physmem.c:416:
+int iomem_size = 0;
