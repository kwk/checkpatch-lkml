Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 118 exceeds 100 columns
#65: FILE: include/net/sock.h:709:
+#define bh_lock_sock(__sk)	do { rcu_read_lock_read(&ptype_lock); spin_lock(&((__sk)->sk_lock.slock)); } while (0)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
