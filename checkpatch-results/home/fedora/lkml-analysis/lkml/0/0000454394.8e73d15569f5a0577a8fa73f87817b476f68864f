ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#69: 
--- a/Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt	Wed Jun 19 11:27:29 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_VARIABLE: Use of EXTRA_CFLAGS is deprecated, please use `ccflags-y instead.
#113: FILE: fs/ntfs/Makefile:8:
+EXTRA_CFLAGS = -DNTFS_VERSION=\"2.0.9\"

EXTRA_{A,C,CPP,LD}FLAGS are deprecated and should be replaced by the new
flags added via commit f77bf01425b1 ("kbuild: introduce ccflags-y,
asflags-y and ldflags-y").

The following conversion scheme maybe used::

  EXTRA_AFLAGS    ->  asflags-y
  EXTRA_CFLAGS    ->  ccflags-y
  EXTRA_CPPFLAGS  ->  cppflags-y
  EXTRA_LDFLAGS   ->  ldflags-y

+	name = (u8*)kmalloc(NTFS_MAX_NAME_LEN * NLS_MAX_CHARSET_SIZE + 1,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
