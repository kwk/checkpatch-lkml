CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:59:
+extern void *kmem_cache_zalloc(kmem_cache_t *, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'kmem_cache_t *' should also have an identifier name
#49: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:59:
+extern void *kmem_cache_zalloc(kmem_cache_t *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name

+extern void *kmem_cache_zalloc(kmem_cache_t *, int);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#63: FILE: mm/slab.c:1618:
+	void    *ptr;
+	ptr = __kmem_cache_alloc(cachep, flags);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
