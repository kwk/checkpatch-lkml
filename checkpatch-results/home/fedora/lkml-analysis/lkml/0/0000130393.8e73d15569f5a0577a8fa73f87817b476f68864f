WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns

+	andi.	r0,r9,(_TIF_SYSCALL_T_OR_A|_TIF_SIGPENDING|_TIF_NEED_RESCHED|_TIF_RESTOREALL|_TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#200: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/systbl.S:325:
+COMPAT_SYS(ppoll)^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#217: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/thread_info.h:145:
+#define _TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK	(1<<TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK)
                             	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#217: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/thread_info.h:145:
+#define _TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK	(1<<TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
