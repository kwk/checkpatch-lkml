Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_CASTS: unnecessary cast may hide bugs, see http://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
