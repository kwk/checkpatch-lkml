Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#99: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:290:
+	p->set_child_tid = p->clear_child_tid = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#153: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:52:
+#define CLONE_UNTRACED		0x00800000	/* set if the tracing process can't force CLONE_PTRACE on this clone */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 112 exceeds 100 columns
#173: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:620:
+extern struct task_struct *do_fork(unsigned long, unsigned long, struct pt_regs *, unsigned long, int *, int *);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#173: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:620:
+extern struct task_struct *do_fork(unsigned long, unsigned long, struct pt_regs *, unsigned long, int *, int *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#173: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:620:
+extern struct task_struct *do_fork(unsigned long, unsigned long, struct pt_regs *, unsigned long, int *, int *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
