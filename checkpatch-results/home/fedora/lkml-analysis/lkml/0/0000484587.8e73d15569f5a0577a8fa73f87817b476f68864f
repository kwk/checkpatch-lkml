Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#85: FILE: usb.c:2082:
+^I^I^I}^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#93: FILE: usb.c:2085:
+				err("config descriptor too short (expected %i, got %i)", length, result);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#99: FILE: usb.c:2091:
+		}
+		else {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#99: FILE: usb.c:2091:
+		else {
+			memcpy(bigbuffer, buffer, length);
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
