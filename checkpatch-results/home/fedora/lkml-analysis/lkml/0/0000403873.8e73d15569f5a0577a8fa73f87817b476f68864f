ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#92: FILE: net/sched/Kconfig:5:
+config NET_SCHED
+	bool "QoS and/or fair queueing"
+	---help---
+	  When the kernel has several packets to send out over a network
+	  device, it has to decide which ones to send first, which ones to
+	  delay, and which ones to drop. This is the job of the packet
+	  scheduler, and several different algorithms for how to do this
+	  "fairly" have been proposed.
+
+	  If you say N here, you will get the standard packet scheduler, which
+	  is a FIFO (first come, first served). If you say Y here, you will be
+	  able to choose from among several alternative algorithms which can
+	  then be attached to different network devices. This is useful for
+	  example if some of your network devices are real time devices that
+	  need a certain minimum data flow rate, or if you need to limit the
+	  maximum data flow rate for traffic which matches specified criteria.
+	  This code is considered to be experimental.
+
+	  To administer these schedulers, you'll need the user-level utilities
+	  from the package iproute2+tc at <ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/>.
+	  That package also contains some documentation; for more, check out
+	  <http://snafu.freedom.org/linux2.2/iproute-notes.html>.
+
+	  This Quality of Service (QoS) support will enable you to use
+	  Differentiated Services (diffserv) and Resource Reservation Protocol
+	  (RSVP) on your Linux router if you also say Y to "QoS support",
+	  "Packet classifier API" and to some classifiers below. Documentation
+	  and software is at <http://icawww1.epfl.ch/linux-diffserv/>.
+
+	  If you say Y here and to "/proc file system" below, you will be able
+	  to read status information about packet schedulers from the file
+	  /proc/net/psched.
+
+	  The available schedulers are listed in the following questions; you
+	  can say Y to as many as you like. If unsure, say N now.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
