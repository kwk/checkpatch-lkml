WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#52: FILE: fs/isofs/rock.c:41:
+static int setup_rock_ridge(struct iso_directory_record *de, struct inode *inode, unsigned char ** chr)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo ** bar" should be "foo **bar"
#52: FILE: fs/isofs/rock.c:41:
+static int setup_rock_ridge(struct iso_directory_record *de, struct inode *inode, unsigned char ** chr)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#55: FILE: fs/isofs/rock.c:44:
+	int len = sizeof(struct iso_directory_record) + de->name_len[0];
+	if (len & 1)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
