WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#75: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:422:
+DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_FINAL(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA,	PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8237,		quirk_via_vt8237_bypass_apic_deassert);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
