ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#81: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:23:
+static void sysfs_d_iput(struct dentry * dentry, struct inode * inode)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#90: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:32:
+static struct dentry_operations sysfs_dentry_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
