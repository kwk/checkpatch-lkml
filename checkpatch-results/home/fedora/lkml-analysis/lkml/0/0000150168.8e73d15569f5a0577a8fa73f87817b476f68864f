WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'hppfs_open', this function's name, in a string
#106: FILE: fs/hppfs/hppfs_kern.c:530:
+				printk("hppfs_open : failed to read data from "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#107: FILE: fs/hppfs/hppfs_kern.c:531:
+				printk("hppfs_open : failed to read data from "
+						"host, err = %ld\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
