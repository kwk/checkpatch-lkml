CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#145: FILE: drivers/net/netconsole.c:287:
+	if (target_mac) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#154: FILE: drivers/net/netconsole.c:296:
+			char *sep;
+			val = simple_strtoul(ptr, &sep, 16);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#154: FILE: drivers/net/netconsole.c:296:
+			val = simple_strtoul(ptr, &sep, 16);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#243: FILE: netconsole-client.c:46:
+		fprintf(stderr, "usage: netconsole-client --client <IP> [--port <port> [--server <IP>]]\n");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#250: FILE: netconsole-client.c:51:
+	printf("listening on interface %s:%d for server %s:%d.\n", argv[2], port, argc > 6 ? argv[6] : "ANY", port);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
