The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#78: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:33:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*ff)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct fuse_file)...)
#86: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:41:
+	ff = kmalloc(sizeof(struct fuse_file), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#174: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:129:
+	if (err == -ENOSYS) {

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'fuse_set_page_dirty', this function's name, in a string
#349: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:304:
+	printk("fuse_set_page_dirty: should not happen\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#354: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:309:
+static struct file_operations fuse_file_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
