WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#45: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:117:
+	struct page *pages[HPAGE_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE];	/* page buffer */
 	                             ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#54: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:151:
+	struct vm_area_struct * vma;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#62: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:158:
+		unsigned long n = dio->curr_user_address & PAGE_MASK;
+		n = (n & ~HPAGE_MASK) >> PAGE_SHIFT;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#63: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:159:
+		n = HPAGE_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE - n;
 		              ^

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#65: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:161:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
