3) Rename __scheduling_functions_start_here/end_here to __sched_text_start/end.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#602: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:179:
+extern int in_sched_functions(unsigned long addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#630: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3675:
+	extern char __sched_text_start[], __sched_text_end[];

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#631: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3676:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
