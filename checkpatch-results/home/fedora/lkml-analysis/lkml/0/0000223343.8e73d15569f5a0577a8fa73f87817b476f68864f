CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#123: FILE: kernel/fork.c:741:
+	sig->it_real_value = sig->it_real_incr = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#125: FILE: kernel/fork.c:743:
+	sig->real_timer.data = (unsigned long) tsk;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#153: FILE: kernel/itimer.c:20:

+	if (timer_pending(&sig->real_timer)) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
