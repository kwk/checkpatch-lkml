EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#84: FILE: kernel/resource.c:133:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
