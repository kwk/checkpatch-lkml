Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:532:
+extern int dequeue_signal(sigset_t *mask, siginfo_t *info);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#87: FILE: kernel/signal.c:409:
+static int __dequeue_signal(struct sigpending *pending, sigset_t *mask,
+			siginfo_t *info)

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#96: FILE: kernel/signal.c:436:
+ * Dequeue a signal and return the element to the caller, which is $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#110: FILE: kernel/signal.c:450:
+		int signr = __dequeue_signal(&current->sig->shared_pending, mask, info);
+		if (signr)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
