CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#103: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:377:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cdi"
#169: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:495:
+	if (cdi == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#226: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:2702:
+	cdrom_numbers = kmalloc(n_entries * sizeof(unsigned long), GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#504: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.h:41:
+#define SECTOR_SIZE		(1 << SECTOR_BITS)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SCpnt>
#530: FILE: drivers/scsi/sr.c:293:
+	sg_count = SCpnt->use_sg;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#531: FILE: drivers/scsi/sr.c:294:
+	if (sg_count)
[...]
 	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#542: FILE: drivers/scsi/sr.c:302:
+	if ((sg = scsi_malloc(i)) == NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
