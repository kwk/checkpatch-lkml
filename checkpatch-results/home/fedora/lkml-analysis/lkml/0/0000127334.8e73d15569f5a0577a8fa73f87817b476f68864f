Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "log->bios_event_log"
#145: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_bios.c:385:
+	if (log->bios_event_log != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*log)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct tpm_bios_log)...)
#181: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_bios.c:436:
+	log = kzalloc(sizeof(struct tpm_bios_log), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
