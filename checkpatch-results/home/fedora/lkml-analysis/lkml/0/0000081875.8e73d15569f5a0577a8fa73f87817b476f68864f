CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#195: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:320:
+	n = m = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#275: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:391:
+					BUG_ON(!page_list);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#283: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:399:
+					memcpy((void *)pbe->address,
+						(void *)pbe->orig_address,

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#319: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:557:
+	for_each_pbe (p, pblist)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#412: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:644:

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#568: FILE: kernel/power/power.h:58:
+extern unsigned int count_data_pages(unsigned int *total);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#576: FILE: kernel/power/power.h:121:
+extern void free_image(void);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#682: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1469:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#727: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:187:
+extern unsigned long shrink_all_memory(unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
