CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/cacheflush.h> instead of <asm/cacheflush.h>
#62: FILE: arch/frv/kernel/frv_ksyms.c:19:
+#include <asm/cacheflush.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

+extern long __memset_user(void *dst, const void *src, size_t count);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
