CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ifa"
#76: FILE: drivers/net/bonding.c:1174:
+			if (ifa != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#78: FILE: drivers/net/bonding.c:1176:
+			read_unlock_irqrestore(&(((struct in_device *)slave_dev->ip_ptr)->lock), rflags);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
