#27: 
OK, let's see what can be done.  Situation is the same for all seq_file-based

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#82: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:522:
+static void create_seq_entry(char *name, mode_t mode, struct file_operations *f)

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#85: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:525:
+	struct proc_dir_entry *entry;
+	entry = create_proc_entry(name, mode|S_IFIFO, NULL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
