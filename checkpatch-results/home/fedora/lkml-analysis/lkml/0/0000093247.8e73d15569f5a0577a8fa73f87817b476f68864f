WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'immidiate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'immediate'?
#73: FILE: kernel/itimer.c:239:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#85: FILE: kernel/itimer.c:251:
+	it_new.it_interval.tv_sec = it_new.it_interval.tv_usec = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#94: FILE: kernel/itimer.c:260:
+	if ((!it_old.it_value.tv_sec && it_old.it_value.tv_usec) ||
+	      it_old.it_value.tv_usec >= 500000)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#225: FILE: include/linux/time.h:98:
+extern unsigned int alarm_setitimer(unsigned int seconds);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
