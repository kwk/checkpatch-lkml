#27: 
Improve some error messages in the COW driver, and say V3, not V2, when talking

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'write_cow_header', this function's name, in a string
#59: FILE: arch/um/drivers/cow_user.c:179:
+		cow_printf("write_cow_header - failed to allocate COW V3 header\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
