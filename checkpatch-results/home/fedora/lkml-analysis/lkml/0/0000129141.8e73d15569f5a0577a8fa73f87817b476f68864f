WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#35: 
nfsd read requests can be out of order, concurrent and with no ra-state info.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'overlaped' may be misspelled - perhaps 'overlapped'?
#48: 
overlaped read-ahead requests, which lead to many conflicts at step 4.
^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#54: 
# for pid in `pidof nfsd`; do taskset -p 1 $pid; done

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'relavant' may be misspelled - perhaps 'relevant'?
#64: 
readahead_ratio = 0, ra_max = 128kb (old logic, the ra_max is really not relavant)
                                                                         ^^^^^^^^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#123: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:627:
+#define RA_FLAG_NFSD		(1UL<<29)	/* request from nfsd */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
