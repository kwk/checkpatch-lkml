WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#61: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/scsiglue.c:223:
+ * Calling this for a SCSI-initiated reset is unnecessary but harmless. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/scsiglue.h:49:
+extern void usb_stor_report_device_reset(struct us_data *us);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#116: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/transport.c:998:

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#139: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/transport.c:984:
				bcs, US_BULK_CS_WRAP_LEN, NULL);

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.
