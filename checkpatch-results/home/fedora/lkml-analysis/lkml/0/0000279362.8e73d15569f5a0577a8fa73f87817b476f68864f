Fine. Since we will have to setup the static priority everytime CPU_DEAD is

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#58: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3249:
+	idle->prio = idle->static_prio = MAX_PRIO;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
