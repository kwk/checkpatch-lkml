#34: 
o The global sysfs_mount indicates whether sysfs is mounted or not. For this

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#98: FILE: fs/sysfs/mount.c:15:
+struct vfsmount *sysfs_mount = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#112: FILE: fs/sysfs/mount.c:38:
+^I^Iinode->i_nlink += sysfs_get_link_count(NULL);^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
