CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#42: FILE: include/net/x25.h:246:
+extern int x25_check_calluserdata(struct x25_calluserdata *,struct x25_calluserdata *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct x25_calluserdata *' should also have an identifier name
#42: FILE: include/net/x25.h:246:
+extern int x25_check_calluserdata(struct x25_calluserdata *,struct x25_calluserdata *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#60: FILE: net/x25/af_x25.c:231:
+static struct sock *x25_find_listener(struct x25_address *addr, struct x25_calluserdata *calluserdata)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#77: FILE: net/x25/af_x25.c:246:
 		     s->sk_state == TCP_LISTEN) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
