Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option

the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct machine_desc should normally be const
#554: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/spitz.c:350:
+static void __init fixup_spitz(struct machine_desc *desc,

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
