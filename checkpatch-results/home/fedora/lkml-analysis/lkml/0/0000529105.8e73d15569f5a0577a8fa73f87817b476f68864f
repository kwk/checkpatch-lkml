WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#74: FILE: drivers/sound/trident.c:3616:
+		extern struct hwrpb_struct *hwrpb;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#75: FILE: drivers/sound/trident.c:3617:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'hwrpb->sys_type'
#76: FILE: drivers/sound/trident.c:3618:
+		if ((hwrpb->sys_type) == 201) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
