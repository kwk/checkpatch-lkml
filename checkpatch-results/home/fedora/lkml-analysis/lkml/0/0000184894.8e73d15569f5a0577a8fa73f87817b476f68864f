The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#80: FILE: include/linux/plist.h:40:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"

+static inline struct pl_node* plist_next(const struct pl_head *head)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#142: FILE: lib/plist.c:2:
+ * lib/plist.c - Priority List implementation.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#154: FILE: lib/plist.c:14:
+		if (node->prio < iter->prio)
[...]
+		else if (node->prio == iter->prio) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#171: FILE: lib/plist.c:31:
+		struct pl_node *next = plist_next(&node->plist);
+		list_move_tail(&next->plist.prio_list, &node->plist.prio_list);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
