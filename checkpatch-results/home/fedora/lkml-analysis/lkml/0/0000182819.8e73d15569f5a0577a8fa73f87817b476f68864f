WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#85: FILE: include/asm-generic/timeofday.h:1:
+/*  linux/include/asm-generic/timeofday.h

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#85: FILE: include/asm-generic/timeofday.h:1:
+/*  linux/include/asm-generic/timeofday.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#99: FILE: include/asm-generic/timeofday.h:15:
+extern nsec_t read_persistent_clock(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#104: FILE: include/asm-generic/timeofday.h:20:
+extern void arch_update_vsyscall_gtod(nsec_t wall_time, cycle_t offset_base,

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#104: FILE: include/asm-generic/timeofday.h:20:
+				struct timesource_t* timesource, int ntp_adj);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
