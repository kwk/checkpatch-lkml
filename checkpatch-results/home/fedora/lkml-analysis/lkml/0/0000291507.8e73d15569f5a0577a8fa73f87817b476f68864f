CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#106: FILE: scripts/modpost.c:135:
+	new = symbolhash[hash] = alloc_symbol(name, symbolhash[hash]);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#165: FILE: scripts/modpost.c:432:
+		 * case module doesn't have its own. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
