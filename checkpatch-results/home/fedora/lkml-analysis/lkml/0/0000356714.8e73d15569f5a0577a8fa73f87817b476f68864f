ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#61: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/intel.c:12:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#64: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/intel.c:15:
+extern void select_idle_routine(const struct cpuinfo_x86 *c);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#87: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:150:

+/*

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#96: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:157:
+static void mwait_idle (void)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#105: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:165:
+			__monitor((void *)&current_thread_info()->flags,
+			if (need_resched())

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#116: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:176:
+		printk("Monitor/Mwait feature present.\n");

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#123: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:183:
+		if (!pm_idle) {
+			pm_idle =3D mwait_idle;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
