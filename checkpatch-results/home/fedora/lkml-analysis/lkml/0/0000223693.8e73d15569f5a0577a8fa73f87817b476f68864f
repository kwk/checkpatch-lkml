The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#355: FILE: net/sunrpc/cache.c:1099:
+static struct seq_operations cache_content_op = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
