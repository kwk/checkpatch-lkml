WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#16: 
Subject: [PATCH][SPARSE] Use $(CC) consistently throughout the Makefile

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#33: 
--- a/Makefile	Sat Jun  7 16:44:31 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
