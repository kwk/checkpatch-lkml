#35: 
Ok here's a patch I've booted and tested with a modification to swap prefetch

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#72: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:30:
+#define PREFETCH_NORMAL		(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#73: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:31:
+#define PREFETCH_AGGRESSIVE ^I(1 << 1)$

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#73: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:31:
+#define PREFETCH_AGGRESSIVE 	(1 << 1)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'peformed' may be misspelled - perhaps 'performed'?
#77: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:35:
+ * Once PREFETCH_AGGRESSIVE is set, swap prefetching will be peformed as much
