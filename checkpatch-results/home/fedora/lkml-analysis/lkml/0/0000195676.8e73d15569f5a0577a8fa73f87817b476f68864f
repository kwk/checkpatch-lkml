Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#84: FILE: crypto/compress.c:26:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#133: FILE: include/linux/crypto.h:377:
+	BUG_ON(crypto_tfm_alg_type(tfm) != CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_COMPRESS);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
