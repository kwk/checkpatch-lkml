CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/ptrace.h:87:
+extern void __ptrace_detach(struct task_struct *, unsigned int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct task_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#72: FILE: include/linux/ptrace.h:87:
+extern void __ptrace_detach(struct task_struct *, unsigned int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name
#72: FILE: include/linux/ptrace.h:87:
+extern void __ptrace_detach(struct task_struct *, unsigned int);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#84: FILE: kernel/ptrace.c:74:
+	BUG_ON(!child->ptrace);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
