#34: 
I'm working on cleaning up some of our dma allocation code to properly allocate 32-bit physical pages for dma on 64-bit platforms. I think our first pass at supporting em64t is sub-par. I'd like to fix that by using the correct kernel interfaces.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
