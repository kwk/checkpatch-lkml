WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#58: 
rename from include/asm-arm/arch-at91rm9200/at91rm9200_usart.h

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#66: FILE: drivers/serial/atmel_serial.h:2:
+ * drivers/serial/atmel_serial.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
