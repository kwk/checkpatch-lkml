ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#33: FILE: fs/super.c:832:
+        retval = 0;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#33: FILE: fs/super.c:832:
+        retval = 0;$

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#37: FILE: fs/super.c:835:
+		if(!(retval = sb->s_op->remount_fs(sb, &flags, data)));
+	            sb->s_flags = (sb->s_flags & ~MS_RMT_MASK) | (flags & MS_RMT_MASK);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#37: FILE: fs/super.c:835:
+		if(!(retval = sb->s_op->remount_fs(sb, &flags, data)));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#37: FILE: fs/super.c:835:
+		if(!(retval = sb->s_op->remount_fs(sb, &flags, data)));

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#37: FILE: fs/super.c:835:
+		if(!(retval = sb->s_op->remount_fs(sb, &flags, data)));

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
