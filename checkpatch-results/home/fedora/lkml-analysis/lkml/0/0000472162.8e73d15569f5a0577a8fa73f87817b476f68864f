I posted the initial version of this last week.  There was no discussion about the patch itself.  I can only hope that no news is good news :)

#21: 
My first version of the patch reinitialized i_meta_lock for every read_inode call.  This is not a correct way to do it.  However, 2.4 does not have the capability to have fs-specific init_inode_once() functions.  This probably meant altering the sb_ops structure if I wanted ext2_inode_info-specific initialization.  To make the patch less intrusive, I put i_meta_lock right into the inode structure.  I think that this is a good compromize between keeping ext2 code separated from VFS and patch simplicity.  The lock is now initialized once per inode in fs/inode.c's init_once(). 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ^^^^^^^^^^
