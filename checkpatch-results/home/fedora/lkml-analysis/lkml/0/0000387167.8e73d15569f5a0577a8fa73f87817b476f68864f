WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#66: 
One reason why we have some of the warnings left all around in the kernel is

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 132 exceeds 100 columns
#87: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:151:
+				fprintf(stderr, "%s:%d: warning: trying to assign nonexistent symbol %s\n", name, lineno, line + 7);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
