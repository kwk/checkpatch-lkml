CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#53: FILE: sound/ppc/pmac.c:933:
+	prop = (unsigned int *) get_property(sound, "layout-id", NULL);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#74: FILE: sound/ppc/pmac.c:973:
+		switch(layout_id) {

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#131: FILE: sound/ppc/tumbler.c:982:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tas_node"
#177: FILE: sound/ppc/tumbler.c:1130:
+	if (tas_node == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!paddr"
#181: FILE: sound/ppc/tumbler.c:1134:
+	if (paddr == NULL)
