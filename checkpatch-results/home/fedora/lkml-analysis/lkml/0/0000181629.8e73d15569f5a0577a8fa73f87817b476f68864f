ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#66: FILE: drivers/serial/ioc4_serial.c:1016:
+static int inline ioc4_attach_local(struct ioc4_driver_data *idd)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#74: FILE: drivers/serial/ioc4_serial.c:1024:
+	struct ioc4_control* control = idd->idd_serial_data;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#90: FILE: drivers/serial/ioc4_serial.c:1068:
+		if (idd->count_period/IOC4_EXTINT_COUNT_DIVISOR < 20) {

+		} else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
