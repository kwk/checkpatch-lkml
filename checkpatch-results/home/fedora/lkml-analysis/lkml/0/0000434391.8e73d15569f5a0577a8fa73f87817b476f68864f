ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#52: 
--- a/fs/inode.c	Sat Sep  7 14:52:45 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#60: FILE: fs/inode.c:543:
+	unsigned long tmp = hashval + ((unsigned long) sb / L1_CACHE_BYTES);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#61: FILE: fs/inode.c:544:
+	unsigned long tmp = hashval + ((unsigned long) sb / L1_CACHE_BYTES);
+	tmp = tmp + (tmp >> I_HASHBITS);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
