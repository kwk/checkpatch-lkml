WARNING:YIELD: Using yield() is generally wrong. See yield() kernel-doc (sched/core.c)
#57: FILE: drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c:728:
+		yield();

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#77: FILE: drivers/md/dm-table.c:52:
+	void (*event_fn)(void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#166: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:647:
+	struct mapped_device *md = (struct mapped_device *) context;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#200: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:847:
+ *---------------------------------------------------------------*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
