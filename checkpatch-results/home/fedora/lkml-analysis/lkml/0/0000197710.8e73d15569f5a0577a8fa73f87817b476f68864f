ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#82: FILE: kernel/timer.c:94:
+		return (void*)base - __TIMER_PENDING;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#161: FILE: kernel/timer.c:393:
+		 * also sees the list ops */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
