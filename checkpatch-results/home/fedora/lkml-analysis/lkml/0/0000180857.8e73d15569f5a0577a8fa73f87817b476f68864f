Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#285: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:414:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
