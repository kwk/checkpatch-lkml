Sorry for the repeat email but this bug is also in 2.5.22 and my patch is still

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#91: FILE: net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c:163:
+^I^I^I^I^I^Iif (np2 != NULL) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#91: FILE: net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c:163:
+						if (np2 != NULL) 

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1328311239.21255.24.camel@joe2Laptop/

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "np2"
#91: FILE: net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c:163:
+						if (np2 != NULL) 

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#92: FILE: net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c:164:

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#95: FILE: net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c:167:
+								   &((struct tcp_tw_bucket*)sk)->v6_rcv_saddr))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#95: FILE: net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c:167:
+								   &((struct tcp_tw_bucket*)sk)->v6_rcv_saddr))

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
