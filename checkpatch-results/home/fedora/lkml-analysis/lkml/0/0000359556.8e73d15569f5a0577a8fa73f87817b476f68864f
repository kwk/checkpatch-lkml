#29: 
Added needed release function, now all pci hotplug drivers need to implement

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#39: 
--- a/drivers/pci/hotplug/pci_hotplug.h	Wed Jun 25 17:37:57 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#45: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/pci_hotplug.h:54:
+#define to_hotplug_attr(n) container_of(n, struct hotplug_slot_attribute, attr);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
