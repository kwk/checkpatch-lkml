ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#46: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/mpparse.c:47:
+unsigned char pci_bus_to_node [256];

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#146: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/topology.h:29:
+#define pcibus_to_cpumask(bus)		node_to_cpumask(pci_bus_to_node[(bus)->number]);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
