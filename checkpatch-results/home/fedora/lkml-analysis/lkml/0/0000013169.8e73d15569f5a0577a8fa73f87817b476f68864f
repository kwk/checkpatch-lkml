#35: 
- fixes generic seq_operations usages, so that those structs may be defined as "const" as well

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#135: FILE: include/linux/seq_file.h:34:
+int seq_open(struct file *, const struct seq_operations *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const struct seq_operations *' should also have an identifier name
#135: FILE: include/linux/seq_file.h:34:
+int seq_open(struct file *, const struct seq_operations *);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#371: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1708:
+static const char * const policy_types[] = $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#372: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1709:
+static const char * const policy_types[] = 
+	{ "default", "prefer", "bind", "interleave" };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
