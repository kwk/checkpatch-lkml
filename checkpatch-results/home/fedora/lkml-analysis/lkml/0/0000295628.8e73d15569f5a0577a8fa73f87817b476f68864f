ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#46: FILE: drivers/block/cpqarray.c:321:
+	return (cpqarray_init_step2());

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#56: FILE: drivers/block/cpqarray.c:560:
+ *  This is it.  Find all the controllers and register them. $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
