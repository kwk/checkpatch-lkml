Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 120 exceeds 100 columns
#54: FILE: include/linux/rt_irq.h:29:
+# define raw_local_save_flags(flags)	do { typecheck(unsigned long,flags);  __raw_local_save_flags(flags); } while (0)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
