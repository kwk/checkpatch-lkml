WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#47: FILE: include/asm-arm26/bitops.h:189:
+extern int _find_first_zero_bit_le(const unsigned long * p, unsigned size);

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#47: FILE: include/asm-arm26/bitops.h:189:
+extern int _find_first_zero_bit_le(const unsigned long * p, unsigned size);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/asm-arm26/bitops.h:189:
+extern int _find_first_zero_bit_le(const unsigned long * p, unsigned size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
