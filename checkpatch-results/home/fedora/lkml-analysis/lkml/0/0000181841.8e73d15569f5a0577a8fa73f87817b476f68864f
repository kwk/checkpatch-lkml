Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#58: FILE: include/asm/fixmap.h:93:
+ BUG_ON(vaddr >= FIXADDR_TOP || vaddr < FIXADDR_USER_START);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
