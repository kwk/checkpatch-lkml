+static int mlock_fixup(struct vm_area_struct *vma, struct vm_area_struct **prev,
 	unsigned long start, unsigned long end, unsigned int newflags)

+	struct vm_area_struct * vma, * prev;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
