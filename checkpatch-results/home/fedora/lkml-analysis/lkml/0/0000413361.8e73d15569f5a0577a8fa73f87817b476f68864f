WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#99: FILE: arch/i386/lib/usercopy.c:343:
+ * 'size' must be larger than 256 */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
