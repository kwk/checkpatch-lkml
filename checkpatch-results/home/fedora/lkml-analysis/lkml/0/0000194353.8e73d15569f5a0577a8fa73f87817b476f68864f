Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*sbuf)...) over kmalloc(sizeof (struct kstatfs)...)
#65: FILE: kernel/acct.c:116:
+	sbuf = kmalloc(sizeof (struct kstatfs), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
