system, which cause inadequate completions of synchronous write I/O operations

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#89: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:560:
+int write_inode_now(struct inode *inode, int sync)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#114: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:646:
+	if (need_write_inode_now) {
[...]
  	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#156: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1344:
+extern int write_inode_now(struct inode *, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#156: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1344:
+extern int write_inode_now(struct inode *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
