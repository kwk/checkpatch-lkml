CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#57: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.c:13:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/thread_info.h> instead of <asm/thread_info.h>
#58: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.c:14:
+#include <asm/thread_info.h>

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#65: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.c:21:
+#define OFFSET(sym, str, mem) \
+	DEFINE(sym, offsetof(struct str, mem));

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
