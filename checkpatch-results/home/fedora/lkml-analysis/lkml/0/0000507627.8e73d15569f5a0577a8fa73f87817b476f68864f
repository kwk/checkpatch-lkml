The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

#108: FILE: include/asm-i386/syscall.h:23:
+extern int		sigsuspend1(struct pt_regs *regs, old_sigset_t mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#114: FILE: include/asm-i386/syscall.h:29:
+extern asmlinkage int	sys_pipe(unsigned long * fildes);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
