CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#46: FILE: include/linux/timex.h:96:
+#define FINENSEC (1L << SHIFT_SCALE) /* ~1 ns in phase units */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
#92: FILE: kernel/timer.c:687:
+	adj += shift_right(ltemp,(SHIFT_USEC + SHIFT_HZ - SHIFT_SCALE));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#139: FILE: kernel/timer.c:742:
+		long ltemp = time_phase >> SHIFT_SCALE;
+		time_phase -= ltemp << SHIFT_SCALE;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
