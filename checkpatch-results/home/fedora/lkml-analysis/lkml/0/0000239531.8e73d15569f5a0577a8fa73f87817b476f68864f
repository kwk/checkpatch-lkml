#46: 
  Signed-off-by: Dmitry Torokhov <dtor@mail.ru>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#69: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:100:
+	sonypi_device.queue.head = sonypi_device.queue.tail = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#79: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:108:
+        return sonypi_device.queue.len == 0;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#79: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:108:
+        return sonypi_device.queue.len == 0;$

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#155: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:519:
+	retval = fasync_helper(fd, filp, on, &sonypi_device.fasync);
 	                           ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#256: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:839:
+		sonypi_device.jog_dev.name = (char *) kmalloc(

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('
#256: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:839:
+		sonypi_device.jog_dev.name = (char *) kmalloc(

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_CASTS: unnecessary cast may hide bugs, see http://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html
#256: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:839:
+		sonypi_device.jog_dev.name = (char *) kmalloc(

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
