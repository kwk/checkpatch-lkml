Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#71: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:1052:
+		default:	res->name =3D "unknown";

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
