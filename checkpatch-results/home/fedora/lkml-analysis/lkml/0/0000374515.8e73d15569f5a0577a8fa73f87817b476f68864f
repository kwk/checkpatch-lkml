This is for 2.4 only -- 2.5 with ISDN doesn't even boot for me at the moment.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'drivers' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'PACKET_NOACK != bcs->tx_skb->pkt_type'
#38: FILE: isdn/hisax/hfc_pci.c:690:
+			if (bcs->st->lli.l1writewakeup &&
+                           (PACKET_NOACK != bcs->tx_skb->pkt_type))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

+                           (PACKET_NOACK != bcs->tx_skb->pkt_type))$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
