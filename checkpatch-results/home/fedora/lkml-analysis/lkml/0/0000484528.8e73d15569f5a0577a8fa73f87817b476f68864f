#24: 
Could you try this patchlet to fs/partitions/check.c::read_dev_sector() and look if there is any output by dmesg? It's

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#35: FILE: fs/partitions/check.c:414:
+		if (mapping->a_ops->sync_page)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
