CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'zone_size_pages == PAGES_PER_SECTION'
#67: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2083:
+	if (hotadd && (zone_size_pages == PAGES_PER_SECTION))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#124: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2842:
+	int i;
+	for_each_online_node(i)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#136: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2854:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
