#25: 
Firstly, the kernel lists that the device has an EXTRA_BTN - this is not true.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
