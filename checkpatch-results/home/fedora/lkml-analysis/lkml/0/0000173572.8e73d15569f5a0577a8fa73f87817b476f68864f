WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#97: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:285:
+	/* dev->current_state == PCI_D3cold actually indicates (re)boot
+		-- some firmware will leave devices in D3hot on boot

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
