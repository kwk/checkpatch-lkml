Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#134: FILE: arch/h8300/platform/h8s/ints.c:2:
+ * linux/arch/h8300/platform/h8s/ints.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#151: FILE: arch/h8300/platform/h8s/ints.c:77:
+static short use_kmalloc = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
