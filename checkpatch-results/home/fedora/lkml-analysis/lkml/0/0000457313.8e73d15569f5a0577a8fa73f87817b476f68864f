ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#39: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c	Tue May 21 14:47:06 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line

 static irq_balance_t irq_balance[NR_IRQS] __cacheline_aligned

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
