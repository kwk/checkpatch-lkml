ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#73: FILE: drivers/scsi/libata-core.c:4138:
+ *^IUnregister all objects associated with this host set. Free those $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#80: FILE: drivers/scsi/libata-core.c:4145:

+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#188: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:396:
+extern void ata_host_set_remove(struct ata_host_set *host_set);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
