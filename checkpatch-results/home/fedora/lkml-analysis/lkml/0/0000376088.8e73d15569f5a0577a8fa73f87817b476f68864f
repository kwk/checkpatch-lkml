ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#114: FILE: drivers/char/agp/agpgart_be.c:1148:
+	} else
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#114: FILE: drivers/char/agp/agpgart_be.c:1148:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#157: FILE: drivers/char/agp/agpgart_be.c:1235:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#157: FILE: drivers/char/agp/agpgart_be.c:1235:
+		agp_bridge.previous_size = agp_bridge.current_size = (void *) values;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#159: FILE: drivers/char/agp/agpgart_be.c:1237:
+		return(values[0].size);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
