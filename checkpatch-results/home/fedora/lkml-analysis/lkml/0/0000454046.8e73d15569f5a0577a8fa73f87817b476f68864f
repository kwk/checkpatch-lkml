CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:462:
+extern task_t *find_task_by_pid(int pid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#83: FILE: kernel/fork.c:79:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
