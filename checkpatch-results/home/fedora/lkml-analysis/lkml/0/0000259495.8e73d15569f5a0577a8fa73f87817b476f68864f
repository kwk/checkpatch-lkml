#47: 
This patch contains the code that enables us to access the previous kernel's

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#104: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:292:
+static ssize_t read_hmem(struct file * file, char * buf,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#124: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:312:
+		if ((pfn != -1) && (pfn > saved_max_pfn))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#155: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:737:
+static struct file_operations hmem_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0640'.
#177: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:828:
+	{12,"hmem",    S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP, &hmem_fops},

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
