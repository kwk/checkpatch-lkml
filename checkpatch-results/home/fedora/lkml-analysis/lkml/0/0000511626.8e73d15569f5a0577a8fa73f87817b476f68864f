WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'trys' may be misspelled - perhaps 'tries'?
#78: FILE: fs/super.c:693:
+ * it trys to use the specific super update function,
       ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#86: FILE: fs/super.c:701:
+		if (sb->s_op)
+		{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#116: FILE: fs/super.c:735:
+		if (sb->s_dirt && !(sb->s_flushed)) {
[...]
 			goto restart;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#165: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:863:
+	void (*write_super_kupdated) (struct super_block *);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct super_block *' should also have an identifier name
#165: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:863:
+	void (*write_super_kupdated) (struct super_block *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#174: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1203:
+extern void sync_supers(kdev_t, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'kdev_t' should also have an identifier name
#174: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1203:

#185: FILE: fs/reiserfs/super.c:34:
+void reiserfs_write_super_ex (struct super_block * s, int immediate)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
