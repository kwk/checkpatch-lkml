WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#16: 
Subject: Re: 1 New compile/sparse warning (overnight build)

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#65: FILE: fs/bio.c:500:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
