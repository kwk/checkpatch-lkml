#33: 
The new cbe_pmd_shadow_regs structure is added to the cbe_regs_map structure

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#58: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/cbe_regs.c:87:
+	struct cbe_regs_map *map = cbe_find_map(np);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!map"
#58: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/cbe_regs.c:87:
+	if (map == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern struct cbe_pmd_shadow_regs *cbe_get_pmd_shadow_regs(struct device_node *np);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
