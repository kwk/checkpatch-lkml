CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#43: FILE: include/linux/pid.h:71:
+extern struct pid *get_task_pid(struct task_struct *task, enum pid_type type);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#57: FILE: kernel/pid.c:311:
+	struct pid *pid;
+	rcu_read_lock();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
