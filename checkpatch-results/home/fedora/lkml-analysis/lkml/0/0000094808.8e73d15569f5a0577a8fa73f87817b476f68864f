hm, it shouldnt cause that. Could you try the attached patch [which is

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#97: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:211:
+extern void softlockup_tick(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#166: FILE: kernel/softlockup.c:54:
+	if (per_cpu(print_timestamp, this_cpu) == touch_timestamp ||
+		did_panic ||

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#185: FILE: kernel/softlockup.c:69:
+	if (time_after(jiffies, touch_timestamp + 10*HZ)) {

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
