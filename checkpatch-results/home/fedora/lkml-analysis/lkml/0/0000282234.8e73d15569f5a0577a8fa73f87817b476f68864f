ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#90: FILE: mm/mmap.c:831:
+	if (!(result = create_hugetlb_file(&hugetlb_file, flags)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#120: FILE: mm/mmap.c:535:
+unsigned long do_mmap_pgoff(struct file * file, unsigned long addr,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#162: FILE: mm/mmap.c:580:
+		file = hugetlb_file = hugetlb_zero_setup(len);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#190: FILE: mm/mmap.c:607:
+		if (can_do_mlock())
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
