WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#54: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1527:
+	BUG_ON(in_interrupt());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:YIELD: Using yield() is generally wrong. See yield() kernel-doc (sched/core.c)
#62: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1535:
+		yield();

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#65: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1538:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "suspending: %s ", drive->name);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#88: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1561:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#120: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1608:
+		ide_hwif_t *hwif = HWIF(drive);
+		sprintf(drive->device.bus_id, "%d", myid);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#201: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-proc.c:572:
+			      (unsigned long long) drive->driver->capacity(drive));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#283: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:481:
+	unsigned blocked        : 1;	/* 1=powermanagment told us not to do anything, so sleep nicely */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
