WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 141 exceeds 100 columns
#50: FILE: drivers/scsi/3w-xxxx.c:2115:
+	mapping = pci_map_page(pdev, virt_to_page(cmd->request_buffer), virt_to_pageoff(cmd->request_buffer), cmd->request_bufflen, dma_dir);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
