#47: FILE: drivers/perfctr/ppc.c:110:
+/* The ppc driver internally uses cstatus & (1<<30) to record that
+   a context has an asynchronously changing MMCR0. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
