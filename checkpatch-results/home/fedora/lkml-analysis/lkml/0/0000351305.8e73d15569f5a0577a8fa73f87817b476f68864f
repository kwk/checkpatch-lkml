WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#43: FILE: arch/m68k/mm/memory.c:371:
+		 * as for user space accesses in <asm/uaccess.h>. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#66: FILE: arch/m68k/mm/memory.c:394:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#170: FILE: include/asm-m68k/cacheflush.h:132:
+extern void flush_icache_range(unsigned long address, unsigned long endaddr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
