CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#56: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1006:
+extern void __set_special_pids(struct task_struct *tsk, pid_t session, pid_t pgrp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#69: FILE: kernel/exit.c:259:
+void __set_special_pids(struct task_struct *tsk, pid_t session, pid_t pgrp)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
