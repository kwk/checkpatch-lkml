CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ap)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct kprobe)...)
#43: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:434:
+		ap = kzalloc(sizeof(struct kprobe), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
