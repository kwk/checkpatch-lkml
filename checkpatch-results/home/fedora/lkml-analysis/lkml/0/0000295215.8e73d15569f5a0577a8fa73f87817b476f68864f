Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#218: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:170:
+		int err = filemap_fdatawait(mapping);
+		if (ret == 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
