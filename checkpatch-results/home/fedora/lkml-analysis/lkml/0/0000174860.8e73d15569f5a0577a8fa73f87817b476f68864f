- Use it in driver_for_each_device() instead of the regular list_head and stop using

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#83: FILE: drivers/base/dd.c:167:
+	struct device_driver * drv = dev->driver;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
