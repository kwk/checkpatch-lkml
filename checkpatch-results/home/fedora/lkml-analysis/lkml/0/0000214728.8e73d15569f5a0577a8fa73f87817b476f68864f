> My name is José María García Pérez (Spain). My system is an: AMD Athlon 800 (this is not an Athlon-XP). I was trying Gentoo for the first time (I'm a newbie). The kernel 2.6.9-r1 makes a similar bug. Then I try to upgrade to kernel-2.6.10-r4. The error persist. It appears when I try to "emerge" with Gentoo.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#97: FILE: include/linux/rmap.h:75:
+void page_remove_rmap(struct page *, struct vm_area_struct *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
