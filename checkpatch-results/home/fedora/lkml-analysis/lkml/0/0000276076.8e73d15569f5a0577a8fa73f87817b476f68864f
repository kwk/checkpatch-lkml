WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#220: FILE: arch/i386/mach-default/setup.c:74:
+static struct irqaction irq0  = { timer_interrupt, SA_INTERRUPT, CPU_MASK_NONE, "timer", NULL, NULL};

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
