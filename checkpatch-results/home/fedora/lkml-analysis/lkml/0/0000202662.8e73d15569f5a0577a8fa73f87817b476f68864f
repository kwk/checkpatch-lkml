CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#63: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca/mthca_cq.c:571:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#190: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca/mthca_cq.c:688:
+	mailbox = kmalloc(sizeof (struct mthca_cq_context) + MTHCA_CMD_MAILBOX_EXTRA,

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*mailbox)...) over kmalloc(sizeof (struct mthca_cq_context)...)
#190: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca/mthca_cq.c:688:
+	mailbox = kmalloc(sizeof (struct mthca_cq_context) + MTHCA_CMD_MAILBOX_EXTRA,

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
