Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: linux/trdevice.h:40:
+extern void tr_source_route(struct sk_buff *skb, struct trh_hdr *trh, struct net_device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
