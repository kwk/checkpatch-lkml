WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#38: FILE: fs/jbd/commit.c:674:
+		 * use in a different page. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
