Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#128: FILE: drivers/usb/host/ohci-hcd.c:352:
+		BUG_ON (ed->state != ED_UNLINK);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#209: FILE: drivers/usb/host/ohci-q.c:310:
+			} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
