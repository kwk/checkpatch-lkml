                       ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#172: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:532:
+		if (fb_logo.depth > 8) {
[...]
+		} else if (fb_logo.depth >= 4 && fb_logo.depth <= 8)
[...]
+		else 
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#342: FILE: include/linux/fb.h:467:
+extern int fb_prepare_logo(struct fb_info *fb_info);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
