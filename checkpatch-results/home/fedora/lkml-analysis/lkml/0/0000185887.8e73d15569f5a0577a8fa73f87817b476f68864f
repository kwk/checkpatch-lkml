EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#111: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:187:
+extern unsigned int FASTCALL(schedule_timeout_msecs(unsigned int timeout));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
