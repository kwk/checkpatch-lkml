#32: 
2.6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#61: FILE: net/sched/act_police.c:49:
+struct tc_police_compat
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
