WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form

signed-off-by: Rusty Lynch <Rusty.lynch@intel.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#148: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/kprobes.c:1:
+ /*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#156: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/kprobes.c:39:
+extern void ia64_kretprobe_trampoline(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#187: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/kprobes.c:125:
+                /* we are using ri->stack_addr as a pt_regs pointer */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#191: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/kprobes.c:129:
+	BUG_ON(!ri);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#227: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/kprobes.c:165:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
