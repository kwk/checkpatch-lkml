Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#111: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:159:
+#define DRV_VERSION		"3.4.14-k4"DRV_EXT

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#313: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:1183:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
