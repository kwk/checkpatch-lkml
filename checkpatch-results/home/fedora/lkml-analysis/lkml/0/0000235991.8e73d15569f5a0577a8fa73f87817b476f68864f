Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#88: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1032:
+extern void normalize_rt_tasks(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
