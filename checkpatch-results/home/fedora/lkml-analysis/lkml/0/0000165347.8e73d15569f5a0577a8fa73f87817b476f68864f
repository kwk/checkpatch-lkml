ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#648: FILE: drivers/hwmon/smsc47b397.c:327:
+	if ((ret = smsc47b397_find(&address)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#749: FILE: drivers/hwmon/smsc47m1.c:568:
+	if (smsc47m1_find(&address)) {
 		return -ENODEV;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
