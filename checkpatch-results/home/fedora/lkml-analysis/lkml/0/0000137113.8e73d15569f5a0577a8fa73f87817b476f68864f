WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'explicitely' may be misspelled - perhaps 'explicitly'?
#38: 
on. I now think that explicitely deleting and re-adding them
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'candiate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'candidate'?
#50: FILE: net/ipv4/devinet.c:234:
+				   struct in_ifaddr *candiate)
 				                     ^^^^^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'candiate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'candidate'?
#54: FILE: net/ipv4/devinet.c:238:
+		inet_ifa_match(primary->ifa_address, candiate));
 		                                     ^^^^^^^^

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ifa"
#94: FILE: net/ipv4/devinet.c:281:
+	for (ifa = promote; ifa != NULL; ifa = ifa->ifa_next)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/net/ip_fib.h:245:
+extern int fib_promote(u32 old, u32 new);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
