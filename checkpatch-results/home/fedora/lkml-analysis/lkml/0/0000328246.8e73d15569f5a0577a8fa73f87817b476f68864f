Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#58: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/efi.c:733:
+				*size = md->phys_addr + (md->num_pages << EFI_PAGE_SHIFT) - phys_addr;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_VALID_PHYS_ADDR_RANGE' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#75: FILE: include/asm-ia64/io.h:75:
+#define ARCH_HAS_VALID_PHYS_ADDR_RANGE

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: include/asm-ia64/io.h:76:
+extern int valid_phys_addr_range (unsigned long addr, size_t *count); /* efi.c */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
