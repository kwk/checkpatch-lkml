WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'dependant' may be misspelled - perhaps 'dependent'?
#54: 
scheduler design dependant.
                 ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#160: FILE: kernel/scheduler.c:944:
+	if (!res) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#164: FILE: kernel/scheduler.c:948:
+	} else

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#169: FILE: kernel/scheduler.c:953:
+struct file_operations proc_schedstat_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
