WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#51: FILE: Documentation/pcmcia/crc32hash.c:1:
+/* crc32hash.c - derived from linux/lib/crc32.c, GNU GPL v2 */

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#53: FILE: Documentation/pcmcia/crc32hash.c:3:
+/* Usage example:
+$ ./crc32hash "Dual Speed"

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#65: FILE: Documentation/pcmcia/crc32hash.c:15:
+	unsigned int crc = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#73: FILE: Documentation/pcmcia/crc32hash.c:23:
+int main(int argc, char **argv) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
