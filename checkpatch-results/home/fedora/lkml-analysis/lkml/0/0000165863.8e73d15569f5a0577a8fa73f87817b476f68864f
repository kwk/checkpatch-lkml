#35: 
reporting to hiddev is supressed if the field value has not changed,
                       ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#62: FILE: drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c:792:
+static void hid_process_event(struct hid_device *hid, struct hid_field *field, struct hid_usage *usage, __s32 value, int interrupt, struct pt_regs *regs)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
