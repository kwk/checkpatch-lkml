WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'termianted' may be misspelled - perhaps 'terminated'?
#47: 
for interfaces using NUL termianted strings, so you'd do:
                         ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!strnchr"
#155: FILE: net/netlink/attr.c:48:
+		if (!minlen || strnchr(nla_data(nla), minlen, '\0') == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#157: FILE: net/netlink/attr.c:50:
+		/* fall through */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.
