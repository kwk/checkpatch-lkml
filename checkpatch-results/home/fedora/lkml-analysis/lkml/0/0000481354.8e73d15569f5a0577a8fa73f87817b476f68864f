reason why it was done in an inverted way is the lack of apropriate

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#61: FILE: include/asm-i386/bitops.h:302:
+static __inline__ int find_first_bit(void * addr, unsigned size)

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#61: FILE: include/asm-i386/bitops.h:302:
+static __inline__ int find_first_bit(void * addr, unsigned size)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
