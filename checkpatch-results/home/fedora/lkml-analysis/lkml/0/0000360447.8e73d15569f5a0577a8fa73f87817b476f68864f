#51: 
--- a/drivers/block/loop.c	Sun Jun 15 01:40:53 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#254: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:826:
+	if (filp == NULL)
 	    ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!filp"
#254: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:826:
+	if (filp == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#303: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:878:
+	if (info->lo_encrypt_type) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!xfer"
#309: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:884:
+		if (xfer == NULL)

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#311: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:886:
+	} else

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#420: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1131:
+	if (n == 0 || n >= MAX_LO_CRYPT || (xfer = xfer_funcs[n]) == NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
