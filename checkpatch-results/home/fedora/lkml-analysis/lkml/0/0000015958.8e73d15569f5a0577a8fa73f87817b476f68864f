CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:468:
+extern int page_to_nid(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#106: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1569:
+		printk("Node %d ", zone_to_nid(zone));
