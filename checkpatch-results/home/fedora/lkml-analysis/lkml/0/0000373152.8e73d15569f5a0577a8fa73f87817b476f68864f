Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#79: FILE: drivers/net/pcmcia/ibmtr_cs.c:130:
+extern irqreturn_t tok_interrupt (int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
