CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bdi"
#67: FILE: drivers/block/blkpg.c:246:
+			if (bdi == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bdi"

+			if (bdi == NULL)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#157: FILE: fs/block_dev.c:600:
+		struct backing_dev_info *bdi = blk_get_backing_dev_info(bdev);
+		if (bdi == NULL)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#213: FILE: fs/inode.c:108:
+ ^I^Imapping->host = inode;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#213: FILE: fs/inode.c:108:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#220: FILE: fs/inode.c:114:
+			inode->i_data.backing_dev_info = sb->s_bdev->bd_inode->i_mapping->backing_dev_info;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#294: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:328:
+extern struct backing_dev_info *blk_get_backing_dev_info(struct block_device *bdev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:INDENTED_LABEL: labels should not be indented

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#346: FILE: include/linux/backing-dev.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#347: FILE: include/linux/backing-dev.h:2:
+ * include/linux/backing-dev.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#424: FILE: fs/fs-writeback.c:546:
+	BUG_ON(!writeback_in_progress(bdi));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
