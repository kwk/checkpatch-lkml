WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#44: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:550:
+	p = pagedir = (suspend_pagedir_t *)__get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC | __GFP_SWSUSP, pagedir_order);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#44: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:550:
+	p = pagedir = (suspend_pagedir_t *)__get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC | __GFP_SWSUSP, pagedir_order);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'order == 0'
#64: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:392:
+	if ((order == 0) && !(cold & __GFP_SWSUSP)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
