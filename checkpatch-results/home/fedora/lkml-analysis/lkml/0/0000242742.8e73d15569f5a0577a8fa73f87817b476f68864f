Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#116: FILE: drivers/macintosh/apm_emu.c:471:
+^I^I^I/* when less than 100mA are used the machine must be on AC and as it is $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns
#117: FILE: drivers/macintosh/apm_emu.c:472:
+			   not charging the battery is only slightly self decharging and thus full be definition */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#117: FILE: drivers/macintosh/apm_emu.c:472:
+			/* when less than 100mA are used the machine must be on AC and as it is 
+			   not charging the battery is only slightly self decharging and thus full be definition */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#117: FILE: drivers/macintosh/apm_emu.c:472:
+			   not charging the battery is only slightly self decharging and thus full be definition */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#118: FILE: drivers/macintosh/apm_emu.c:473:
+			if (amperage < -100) {
[...]
+			else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#124: FILE: drivers/macintosh/apm_emu.c:479:
+			}
+			else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
