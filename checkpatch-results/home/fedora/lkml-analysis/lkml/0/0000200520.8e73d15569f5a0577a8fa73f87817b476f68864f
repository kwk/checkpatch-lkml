#31: 
This forces the caller to provide the lock, but as they all already had one, it's not a big change.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'kobj_probe_t *' should also have an identifier name
#245: FILE: include/linux/kobj_map.h:10:
+struct kobj_map *kobj_map_init(kobj_probe_t *, struct semaphore *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct semaphore *' should also have an identifier name
#245: FILE: include/linux/kobj_map.h:10:
+struct kobj_map *kobj_map_init(kobj_probe_t *, struct semaphore *);
