ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#52: 
--- a/drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c	Mon Oct 31 10:12:20 2005

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#61: FILE: drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c:143:
+				static int cnt = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#62: FILE: drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c:144:
+				static int cnt = 0;
+				if (cnt < 8) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 138 exceeds 100 columns
#64: FILE: drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c:146:
+					printk(KERN_INFO "%s: CDROM not ready.  Make sure there is a disc in the drive.\n", cd->cdi.name);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
