ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#31: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c	Tue Jan 14 00:41:17 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#47: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c:132:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#72: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:75:
+int x86_summit = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#73: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:76:
+u8 bios_cpu_apicid[NR_CPUS] = { [0 ... NR_CPUS-1] = BAD_APICID };
                                               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#99: FILE: include/asm-i386/mach-bigsmp/mach_apic.h:74:
+	return (int) bios_cpu_apicid[mps_cpu];

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#115: FILE: include/asm-i386/mach-default/mach_mpparse.h:25:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
