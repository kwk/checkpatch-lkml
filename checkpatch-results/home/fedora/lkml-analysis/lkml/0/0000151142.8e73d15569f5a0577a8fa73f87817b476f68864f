Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

can simply be::

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
