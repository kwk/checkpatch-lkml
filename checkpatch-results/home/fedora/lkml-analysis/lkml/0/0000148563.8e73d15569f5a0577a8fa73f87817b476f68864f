The trick I used is to move f_rcuhead and f_list in an union called f_u

+		struct file * filp = list_entry(p, struct file, f_u.fu_list);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
