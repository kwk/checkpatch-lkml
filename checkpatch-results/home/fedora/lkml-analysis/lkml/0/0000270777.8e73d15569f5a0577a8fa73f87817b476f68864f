CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#63: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:834:
+	cgc.cmd[2] = cgc.cmd[3] = 0;		/* Starting Feature Number */

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#64: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:835:
+	cgc.cmd[7] = 0; cgc.cmd [8] = 8;	/* Allocation Length */

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#67: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:838:
+	if ((ret = cdi->ops->generic_packet(cdi, &cgc))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

spaces are never used for indentation.
