CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#77: FILE: fs/msdos/namei.c:470:
+	old_sinfo.bh = dotdot_bh = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#130: FILE: fs/msdos/namei.c:505:

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#143: FILE: fs/msdos/namei.c:515:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#195: FILE: fs/msdos/namei.c:559:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
