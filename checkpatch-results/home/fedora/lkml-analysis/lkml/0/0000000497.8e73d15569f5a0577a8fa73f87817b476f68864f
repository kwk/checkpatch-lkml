Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <idVendor>
#192: FILE: drivers/usb/input/hid-ff.c:74:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
