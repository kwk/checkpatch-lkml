CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#42: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:802:
+extern int udma_new_table(struct ata_channel *, struct request *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ata_channel *' should also have an identifier name
#42: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:802:
+extern int udma_new_table(struct ata_channel *, struct request *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#102: FILE: drivers/ide/pcidma.c:321:
+	ch->sg_nents = i = build_sglist(ch, rq);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#113: FILE: drivers/ide/hpt34x.c:256:
+	if (!(count = udma_new_table(ch, rq)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
