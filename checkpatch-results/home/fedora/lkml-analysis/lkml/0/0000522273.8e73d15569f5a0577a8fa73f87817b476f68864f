#58: FILE: mm/memory.c:865:
+static inline void break_cow(struct vm_area_struct * vma, struct page * new_page,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
