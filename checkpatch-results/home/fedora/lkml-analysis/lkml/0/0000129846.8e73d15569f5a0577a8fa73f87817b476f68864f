ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#48: FILE: include/linux/ktimeout.h:64:
+extern int ktimeout_del(struct ktimeout * ktimeout);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/ktimeout.h:64:
+extern int ktimeout_del(struct ktimeout * ktimeout);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'deactive' may be misspelled - perhaps 'deactivate'?

                   ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
