irlmp.c:1244: warning: concatenation of string literals with __FUNCTION__ is deprecated

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 202 exceeds 100 columns
#64: FILE: net/irda/irlmp.c:1277:
+		IRDA_DEBUG(4, "() : curr is %p, next was %p and is now %p, still %d to go - queue len = %d\n", __FUNCTION__, curr, next, self->flow_next, lsap_todo, IRLAP_GET_TX_QUEUE_LEN(self->irlap));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
