WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#64: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:26:
+/* Returns the inode number of the directory entry at offset pos. If bh is
+   non-NULL, it is brelse'd before. Pos is incremented. The buffer header is

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bh"
#95: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:57:
+	if (*bh == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#96: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:58:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "FAT: Directory bread(block %llu) failed\n",

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#117: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:79:
+	    (*de - (struct msdos_dir_entry *)(*bh)->b_data) < MSDOS_SB(dir->i_sb)->dir_per_block - 1) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
