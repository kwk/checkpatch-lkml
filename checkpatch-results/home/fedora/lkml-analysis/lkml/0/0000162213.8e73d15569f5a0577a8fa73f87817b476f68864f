CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#155: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/proto.h:69:
+extern void show_trace(struct task_struct *task, unsigned long *rsp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#168: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:102:
