#28: 
[PATCH] PCI Hotplug: fix the rest of the drivers for __iomem and other sparse issues.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#93: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/shpchp_hpc.c:1495:
+	php_ctlr->creg = ioremap(pci_resource_start(pdev, 0) + shpc_base_offset, pci_resource_len(pdev, 0));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
