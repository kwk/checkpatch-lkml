CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <TxDMAPollPeriod>
#79: FILE: drivers/net/sundance.c:1104:
+	iowrite8(127, ioaddr + TxDMAPollPeriod);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#110: FILE: drivers/net/sundance.c:1173:
+						int i = 10;
+						do {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#110: FILE: drivers/net/sundance.c:1173:
+						do {

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 125 exceeds 100 columns
#111: FILE: drivers/net/sundance.c:1174:
+							iowrite16(ioread16(ioaddr + MACCtrl1) | TxEnable, ioaddr + MACCtrl1);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
