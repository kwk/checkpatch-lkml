Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#124: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pci_dn.c:92:
+		if (pre && ((ret = pre(dn, data)) != NULL))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#146: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pci_dn.c:116:
+void __devinit pci_devs_phb_init_dynamic(struct pci_controller *phb)

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#150: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pci_dn.c:118:
+	struct device_node * dn = (struct device_node *) phb->arch_data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#150: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pci_dn.c:118:
+	struct device_node * dn = (struct device_node *) phb->arch_data;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#159: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pci_dn.c:121:
+	dn->devfn = dn->busno = -1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
