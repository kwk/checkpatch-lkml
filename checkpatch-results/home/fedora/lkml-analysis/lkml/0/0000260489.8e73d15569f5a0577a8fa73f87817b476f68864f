# This is a BitKeeper generated diff -Nru style patch.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as

infront of the log line is enough.

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
