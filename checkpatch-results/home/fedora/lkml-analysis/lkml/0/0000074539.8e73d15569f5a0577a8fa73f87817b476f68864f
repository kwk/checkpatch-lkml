Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

#85: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:2789:
+		printk("ext3_do_update_inode: Now the file size is "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

#89: FILE: fs/ext3/inode.c:2793:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

#112: FILE: fs/ext3/super.c:1308:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+	if (sizeof(blkcnt_t) < sizeof(u64)) {
+		upper_limit = 0x1ff7fffd000LL;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
