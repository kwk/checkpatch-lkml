> I want to integrate the vmwarefb driver posted on this list for 2.4.19pre8 

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#184: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:79:
+extern int vmwarefb_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#185: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:80:
+extern int vmwarefb_setup(char*);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#185: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:80:
+extern int vmwarefb_setup(char*);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char*' should also have an identifier name
#185: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:80:
+extern int vmwarefb_setup(char*);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#2156: FILE: drivers/video/vmware/vmwarefb.h:13:
+# define DBG(x)		printk (KERN_DEBUG "vmwarefb: %s\n", (x));

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
