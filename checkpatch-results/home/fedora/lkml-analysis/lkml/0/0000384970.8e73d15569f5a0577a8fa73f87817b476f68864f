ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#42: FILE: fs/devfs/base.c:2236:
+        but a devfs entry has been registered in the meanwhile */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#42: FILE: fs/devfs/base.c:2236:
+/* XXX: this doesn't handle the case where we got a negative dentry
+        but a devfs entry has been registered in the meanwhile */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
