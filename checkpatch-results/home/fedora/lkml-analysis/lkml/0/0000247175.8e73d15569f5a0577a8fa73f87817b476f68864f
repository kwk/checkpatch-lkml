ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#57: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:652:
+^I^Ireturn; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#124: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:823:
+extern int noirqdebug_setup(char *str);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#126: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:825:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#131: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:830:
+	extern struct pci_raw_ops *raw_pci_ops;

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pci_raw_ops should normally be const
#131: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:830:
+	extern struct pci_raw_ops *raw_pci_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#163: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:862:
+DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_FINAL(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL,	PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_SMCH,	quirk_intel_irqbalance);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
