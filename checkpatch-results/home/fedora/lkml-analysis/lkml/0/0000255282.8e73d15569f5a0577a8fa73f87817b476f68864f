WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: include/asm-i386/ptrace.h:61:
+extern unsigned long profile_pc(struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'spinlock_t *' should also have an identifier name
#95: FILE: include/asm-i386/spinlock.h:46:
+void fastcall __spin_lock_loop(spinlock_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'spinlock_t *' should also have an identifier name
#96: FILE: include/asm-i386/spinlock.h:47:
+void fastcall __spin_lock_loop_flags(spinlock_t *, unsigned long);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#96: FILE: include/asm-i386/spinlock.h:47:
+void fastcall __spin_lock_loop_flags(spinlock_t *, unsigned long);

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#192: FILE: arch/i386/lib/spinlock.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#193: FILE: arch/i386/lib/spinlock.c:2:
+ *	arch/i386/lib/spinlock.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
#201: FILE: arch/i386/lib/spinlock.c:10:
+#define __lockfunc fastcall __attribute__((section(".spinlock.text")))

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __section(".spinlock.text") over __attribute__((section(".spinlock.text")))
#201: FILE: arch/i386/lib/spinlock.c:10:
+#define __lockfunc fastcall __attribute__((section(".spinlock.text")))

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#204: FILE: arch/i386/lib/spinlock.c:13:
+	__asm__ __volatile__ (	"1: lock; decb (%0)\n\t"

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
