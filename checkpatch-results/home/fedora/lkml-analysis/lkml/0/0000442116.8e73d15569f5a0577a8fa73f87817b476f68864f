WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#73: FILE: include/linux/cache_def.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#82: FILE: include/linux/cache_def.h:10:
+	void (*shrink)(int, unsigned int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name
#82: FILE: include/linux/cache_def.h:10:
+	void (*shrink)(int, unsigned int);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: include/linux/cache_def.h:14:
+extern void register_cache(struct cache_definition *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct cache_definition *' should also have an identifier name
#86: FILE: include/linux/cache_def.h:14:
+extern void register_cache(struct cache_definition *);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct cache_definition *' should also have an identifier name

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#104: FILE: kernel/ksyms.c:111:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(unregister_cache);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#156: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:97:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
