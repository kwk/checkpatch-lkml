WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'specfically' may be misspelled - perhaps 'specifically'?
#39: 
Instead of going the lib/lib.a route (which I presume was used so that the linker could decide weather to go with arch specific functions or the generic lib/ ones) it leaves it up to the arch to sort it all out. This could be fair enough, as most (14/20) archs seem to implement their own dump_stack anyway. However, bust_spinlocks could be a problem as only i386, mips64, x86_64 and s390 specfically implement it.
