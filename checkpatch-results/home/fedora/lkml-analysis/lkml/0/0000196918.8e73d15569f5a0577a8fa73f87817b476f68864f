CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around '!dev->power.power_state.event'
#98: FILE: drivers/base/power/suspend.c:46:
+	if (dev->bus && dev->bus->suspend && (!dev->power.power_state.event))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#120: FILE: drivers/base/power/sysfs.c:38:
+	state.event = simple_strtoul(buf, &rest, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#179: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:330:
+^Idefault: $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#180: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:331:
+		printk("They asked me for state %d\n", state.event);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#181: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:332:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#245: FILE: drivers/usb/core/hub.c:1606:
+	if (state.event > PM_EVENT_FREEZE) {
 		dev_warn(&udev->dev, "no poweroff yet, suspending instead\n");
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
