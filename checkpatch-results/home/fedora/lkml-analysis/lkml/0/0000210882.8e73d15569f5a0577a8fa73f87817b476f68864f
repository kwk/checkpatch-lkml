CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#117: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/alps.c:385:
+	psmouse->private = priv = kmalloc(sizeof(struct alps_data), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*priv)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct alps_data)...)
#117: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/alps.c:385:
+	psmouse->private = priv = kmalloc(sizeof(struct alps_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
