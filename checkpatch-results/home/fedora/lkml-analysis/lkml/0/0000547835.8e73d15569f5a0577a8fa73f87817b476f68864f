CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#222: FILE: mm/highmem.c:228:
+	if (nr_emergency_pages >= POOL_SIZE)
[...]
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual

#249: FILE: mm/highmem.c:255:
+		struct page * page = alloc_page(GFP_ATOMIC);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#250: FILE: mm/highmem.c:256:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
