CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#179: FILE: include/linux/gfs2_ondisk.h:457:
+extern void gfs2_rindex_in(struct gfs2_rindex *ri, const struct gfs2_rindex_disk *ri_disk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
