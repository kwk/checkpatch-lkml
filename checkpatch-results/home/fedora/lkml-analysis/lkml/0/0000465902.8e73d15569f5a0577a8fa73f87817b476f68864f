#22: 
The problem regarding the Compaq Presario series 700 sound (no sound output, driver working properly) has been solved by initializing the JackSense JSM register.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'alows' may be misspelled - perhaps 'allows'?
#23: 
This properly sets the AD1886 on Compaq Presario 700 series and alows audio to actually came out.
                                                                ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'beggining' may be misspelled - perhaps 'beginning'?
#24: 
Sometimes a saturated sound cames out from PCM playback...adjusting volume seems to solve it. But this is at least a beggining of support for the 700 sound. I'll post again when I solve this minos issue.
