CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+	desc[0].fields.address = vio_map_single(adapter->vdev, skb->data,
+					desc[0].fields.length, DMA_TO_DEVICE);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#56: FILE: drivers/net/ibmveth.c:662:
+		desc[curfrag+1].fields.address
+			= vio_map_single(adapter->vdev,

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
