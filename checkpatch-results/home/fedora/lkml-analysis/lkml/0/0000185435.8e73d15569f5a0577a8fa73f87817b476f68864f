Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#86: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:161:
+	if ((rc = chip->vendor->send(chip, (u8 *) buf, count)) < 0) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'tpm_transmit', this function's name, in a string
#90: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:163:
+			"tpm_transmit: tpm_send: error %Zd\n", rc);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:PRINTF_Z: %Zd is non-standard C, use %zd
#90: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:163:
+			"tpm_transmit: tpm_send: error %Zd\n", rc);

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'status == chip->vendor->req_canceled'
#101: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:175:
+		if ((status == chip->vendor->req_canceled)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses - maybe == should be = ?
