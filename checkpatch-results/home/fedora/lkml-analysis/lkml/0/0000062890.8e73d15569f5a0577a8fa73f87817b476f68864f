CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#53: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_qp.c:899:
+	else if (qp->s_lsn != (u32) -1) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#79: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_rc.c:99:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#661: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_ruc.c:636:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
