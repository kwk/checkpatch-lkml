> It is *very* common problem for people to think that their root fs is ext3

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#54: FILE: fs/ext3/super.c:1739:
+        return register_filesystem_lifo(&ext3_fs_type);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#54: FILE: fs/ext3/super.c:1739:
+        return register_filesystem_lifo(&ext3_fs_type);$

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#65: FILE: fs/super.c:92:
+int __register_filesystem(struct file_system_type * fs, int lifo)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#75: FILE: fs/super.c:106:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#76: FILE: fs/super.c:107:
+		if (!lifo)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#78: FILE: fs/super.c:109:
+		else {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#93: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1080:
+extern int __register_filesystem(struct file_system_type *, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
