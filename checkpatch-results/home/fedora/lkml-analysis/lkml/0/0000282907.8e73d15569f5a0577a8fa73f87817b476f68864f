ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#48: 
--- a/arch/ppc/mm/fault.c	Mon May 10 15:25:17 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#76: FILE: arch/ppc/mm/init.c:584:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#97: FILE: include/asm-ppc/cacheflush.h:44:
+extern void flush_dcache_icache_page(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
