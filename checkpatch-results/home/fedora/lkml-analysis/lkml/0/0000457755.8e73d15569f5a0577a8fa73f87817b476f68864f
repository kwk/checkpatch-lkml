ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#65: FILE: fs/ext2/ialloc.c:238:
+	struct ext2_group_desc * gdp;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!gdp"
#69: FILE: fs/ext2/ialloc.c:242:
+	if (gdp == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
