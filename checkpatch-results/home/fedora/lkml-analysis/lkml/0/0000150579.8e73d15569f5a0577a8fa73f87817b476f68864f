> Right.  The real question is whether the current behaviour makes any sense.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'addionally' may be misspelled - perhaps 'additionally'?

                                     ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#76: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:296:
+ * threads in the group */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#77: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:297:
+static int proc_task_root_link(struct inode *inode, struct dentry **dentry, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#93: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:312:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#132: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:501:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
