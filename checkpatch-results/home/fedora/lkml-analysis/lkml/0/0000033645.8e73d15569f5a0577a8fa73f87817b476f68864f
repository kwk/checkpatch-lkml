WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#57: FILE: fs/lockd/host.c:113:
+		 * to create a new host entry. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "nsm"
#67: FILE: fs/lockd/host.c:136:
+	if (nsm != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#69: FILE: fs/lockd/host.c:138:
+	else if (!(nsm = nsm_find(sin, hostname, hostname_len)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
