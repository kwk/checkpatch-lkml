#26: 
The current code doesn't handle well general protection faults on the host - it

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#62: FILE: arch/um/kernel/trap_kern.c:130:
+	if (SEGV_IS_FIXABLE(&fi))
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#67: FILE: arch/um/kernel/trap_kern.c:135:
+		 * This code is used in __do_copy_from_user() of TT mode. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
