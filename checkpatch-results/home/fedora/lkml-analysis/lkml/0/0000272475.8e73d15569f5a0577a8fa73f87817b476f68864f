ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#49: FILE: inode.c:1295:
+        */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (7, 9)
#50: FILE: inode.c:1296:
+       if (inode->i_size < 0) {
+         inode->i_size &= 0x0FFFFFFFF;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#50: FILE: inode.c:1296:
+       if (inode->i_size < 0) {
+         inode->i_size &= 0x0FFFFFFFF;
+       }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
