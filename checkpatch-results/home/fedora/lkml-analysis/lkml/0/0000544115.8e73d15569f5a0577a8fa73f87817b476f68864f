ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#96: FILE: fs/smbfs/ioctl.c:48:
+	default:;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:DEFAULT_NO_BREAK: switch default: should use break
#96: FILE: fs/smbfs/ioctl.c:48:
+	default:;

switch default case is sometimes written as "default:;".  This can
cause new cases added below default to be defective.

A "break;" should be added after empty default statement to avoid
unwanted fallthrough.
