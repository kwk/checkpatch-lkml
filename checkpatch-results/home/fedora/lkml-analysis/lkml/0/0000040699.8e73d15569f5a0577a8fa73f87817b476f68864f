EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/linux/netlink.h:153:
+extern struct sock *netlink_lookup(int protocol, __u32 pid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
