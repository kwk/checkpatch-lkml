WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#169: 
### PATCH ###

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#197: FILE: drivers/block/cfq-iosched.c:811:
+	if (cfqq->global_next_crq == NULL) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cfqq->global_next_crq"
#197: FILE: drivers/block/cfq-iosched.c:811:
+	if (cfqq->global_next_crq == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'upto' may be misspelled - perhaps 'up to'?
#200: FILE: drivers/block/cfq-iosched.c:814:
+		/* Allow backward seek upto cfqd->cfq_back_max KiB. */

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#217: FILE: drivers/block/cfq-iosched.c:831:
+			if ((n = rb_next(&crq->rb_node)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
