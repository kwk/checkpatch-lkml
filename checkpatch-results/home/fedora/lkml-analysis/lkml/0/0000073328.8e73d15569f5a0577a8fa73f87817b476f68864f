CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vma"
#139: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/vdso.c:267:
+	if (vma == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#154: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/vdso.c:285:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#191: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/vdso.c:315:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#230: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/page.h:202:
+extern const char *arch_vma_name(struct vm_area_struct *vma);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
