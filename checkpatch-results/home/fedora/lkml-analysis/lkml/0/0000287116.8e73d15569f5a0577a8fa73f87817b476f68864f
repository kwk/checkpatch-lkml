--- a/drivers/input/mouse/logips2pp.c	Wed Apr 21 00:06:21 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#85: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/logips2pp.c:128:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#351: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:460:
+		int type = ps2pp_init(psmouse, set_properties);
+		if (type > PSMOUSE_PS2)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#357: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:465:
 	if (max_proto >= PSMOUSE_IMPS && intellimouse_detect(psmouse)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#444: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:737:
+	psmouse->acking = psmouse->cmdcnt = psmouse->pktcnt = psmouse->out_of_sync = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
