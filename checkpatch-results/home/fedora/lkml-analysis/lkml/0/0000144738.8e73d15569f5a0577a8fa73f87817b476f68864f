CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/pgtable.h> instead of <asm/pgtable.h>
#73: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/suspend.c:15:
+#include <asm/pgtable.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#84: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/suspend.c:148:
+extern void free_eaten_memory(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#184: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/suspend.c:248:

+		next = start + PGDIR_SIZE;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'swsusp_arch_resume', this function's name, in a string
#199: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/suspend.c:263:
+	pr_debug("swsusp_arch_resume(): pages needed = %lu\n", n);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
