> What did you diff this against?  When I applied it to the 2.6.13 source I got :

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'drivers' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#72: FILE: char/pcmcia/cm4040_cs.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'cm4040_read', this function's name, in a string
#178: FILE: char/pcmcia/cm4040_cs.c:239:
+	DEBUG(2, "-> cm4040_read(%s,%d)\n", current->comm, current->pid);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#374: FILE: char/pcmcia/cm4040_cs.c:620:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
