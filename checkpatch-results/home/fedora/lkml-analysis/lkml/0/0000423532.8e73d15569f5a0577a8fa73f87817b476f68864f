CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:427:
+extern void zap_pte(struct mm_struct *, pte_t *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#84: FILE: mm/filemap.c:1300:

+			if (!pmd_none(*pmd) && !pmd_bad(*pmd)) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
