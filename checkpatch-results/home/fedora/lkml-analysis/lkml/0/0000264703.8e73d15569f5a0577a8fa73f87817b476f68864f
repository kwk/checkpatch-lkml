WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#44: FILE: include/asm-generic/pci-dma-compat.h:11:
+#define preempt_atomic() in_atomic()

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 132 exceeds 100 columns
#61: FILE: include/asm-generic/pci-dma-compat.h:30:
+	return dma_alloc_coherent(hwdev == NULL ? NULL : &hwdev->dev, size, dma_handle, preempt_atomic() ? GFP_ATOMIC : GFP_KERNEL);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hwdev"
#61: FILE: include/asm-generic/pci-dma-compat.h:30:
+	return dma_alloc_coherent(hwdev == NULL ? NULL : &hwdev->dev, size, dma_handle, preempt_atomic() ? GFP_ATOMIC : GFP_KERNEL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
