ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#36: 
--- a/include/sound/core.h	Thu Jan 15 11:06:00 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#63: FILE: sound/core/sound.c:67:
+extern struct class_simple *sound_class;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#128: FILE: sound/core/sound.c:367:
+		class_simple_device_add(sound_class, MKDEV(major, controlnum<<5), NULL, "controlC%d", controlnum);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
