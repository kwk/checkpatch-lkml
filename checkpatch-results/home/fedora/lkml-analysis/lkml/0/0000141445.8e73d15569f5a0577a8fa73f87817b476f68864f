Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#187: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_infineon.c:467:
+		if (rc < 0) {
+			return -ENODEV;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#204: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_infineon.c:477:
+static __devexit void tpm_inf_remove(struct pnp_dev* dev) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

#204: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_infineon.c:477:
+static __devexit void tpm_inf_remove(struct pnp_dev* dev) 

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
