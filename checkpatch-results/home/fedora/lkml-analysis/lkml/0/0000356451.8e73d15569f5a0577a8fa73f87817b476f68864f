The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 152 exceeds 100 columns
#107: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:840:
+		kernel_fpu_end();	/* save_processor_state() does kernel_fpu_begin, and we need to revert it in order to pass in_atomic() checks */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#108: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:841:
+		BUG_ON(in_atomic());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
