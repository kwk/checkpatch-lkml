#80: FILE: sys.c:1861:
+	if (copy_to_user(ret, (void*)&jiffies, sizeof(long)))

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
