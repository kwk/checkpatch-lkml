WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#54: 
#define DEFINE_WAIT_BIT(name, _flags, _bit_nr)					\

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
