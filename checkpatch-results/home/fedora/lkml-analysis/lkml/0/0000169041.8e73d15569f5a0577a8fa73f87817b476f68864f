Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#56: FILE: drivers/media/common/saa7146_fops.c:0:
#include <media/saa7146_vv.h>

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#220: FILE: include/media/ir-common.h:20:
*  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
