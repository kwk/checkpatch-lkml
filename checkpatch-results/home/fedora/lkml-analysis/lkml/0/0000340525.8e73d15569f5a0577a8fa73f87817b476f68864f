#36: 
As a side-effect code sizes of all these host drivers were slightly decreased

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#158: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-pnp.c:42:
+	base = (unsigned long) pnp_port_start(dev, 0);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#230: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/buddha.c:182:
 		for(i=0;i<buddha_num_hwifs;i++) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'orginal' may be misspelled - perhaps 'original'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#575: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/q40ide.c:93:
+	/*
+	   Pretranslate addresses for q40 ISA access.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
