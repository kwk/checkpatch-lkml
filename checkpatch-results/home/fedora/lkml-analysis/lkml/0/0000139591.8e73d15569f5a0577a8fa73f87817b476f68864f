ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#73: FILE: sound/oss/dmasound/dmasound_awacs.c:3135:
+	if (awacs_beep_dev == NULL)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!awacs_beep_dev"
#73: FILE: sound/oss/dmasound/dmasound_awacs.c:3135:
+	if (awacs_beep_dev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#75: FILE: sound/oss/dmasound/dmasound_awacs.c:3137:

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#75: FILE: sound/oss/dmasound/dmasound_awacs.c:3137:

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#76: FILE: sound/oss/dmasound/dmasound_awacs.c:3138:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
