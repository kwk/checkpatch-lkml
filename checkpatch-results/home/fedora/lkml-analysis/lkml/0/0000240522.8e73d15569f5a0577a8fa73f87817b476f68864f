#27: 
If we could not allocate a block in the "goal" group, we continue the search in the rest groups:find a new reservation window, allocate a block from there.  Since we could not allocate a block from the goal group anyway, skip the group where the number of free blocks is less than half of window size, there could be a better place to make a reservation.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
