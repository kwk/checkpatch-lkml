CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/linux/kprobes.h:158:
+extern int arch_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#192: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:205:
+        struct kretprobe_instance *ri;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
