CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "net->challenge"
#246: FILE: net/ieee80211/softmac/ieee80211softmac_auth.c:219:
+			if (net->challenge != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

#259: FILE: net/ieee80211/softmac/ieee80211softmac_auth.c:229:
+			 * request. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
