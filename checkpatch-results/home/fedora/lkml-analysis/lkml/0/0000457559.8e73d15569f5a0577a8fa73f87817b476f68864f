ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#123: FILE: asm-generic/tlb.h:21:
+#define tlb_fast_mode(tlb) ((tlb)->nr == ~0UL)^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#145: FILE: asm-generic/tlb.h:68:
+		unsigned long nr, i;
+		nr = tlb->nr;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#248: FILE: mmap.c:1132:
+		printk("mm %p has nonzero rss (%ld) (%d,%s)\n", mm, mm->rss, current->pid, current->comm);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
