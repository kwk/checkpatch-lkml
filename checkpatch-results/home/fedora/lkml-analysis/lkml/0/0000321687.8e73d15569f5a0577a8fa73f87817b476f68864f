#28: 
Using laptop mode for the first time. Kernel is 2.4.23-Vanilla+kdb4.3 on a x86 notebook.

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#32: 
# cat /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#44: 
--- a/fs/jbd/transaction.cWed May 14 11:29:52 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
