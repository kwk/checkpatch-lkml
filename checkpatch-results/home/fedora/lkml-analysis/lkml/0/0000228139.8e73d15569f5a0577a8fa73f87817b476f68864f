WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#45: FILE: drivers/isdn/capi/capidrv.c:2062:
+	for (i = 0; i < card->nbchan; i++) {
+		card->bchans[i].contr = card;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Statements, such as::

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
