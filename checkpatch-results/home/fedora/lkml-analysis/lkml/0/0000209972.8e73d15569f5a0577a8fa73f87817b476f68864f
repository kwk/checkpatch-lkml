CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#124: FILE: mm/filemap.c:643:
+	err = nr = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable

+EXPORT_SYMBOL(find_or_create_pages);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#196: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:73:
+extern int find_or_create_pages(struct address_space *mapping, pgoff_t start,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
