The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#51: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_rcfs.c:255:
+	pid = (pid_t) simple_strtol(str, NULL, 0);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#51: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_rcfs.c:255:
+	pid = (pid_t) simple_strtol(str, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#91: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_rcfs.c:314:
+		.ca_mode = S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#97: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_rcfs.c:320:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
