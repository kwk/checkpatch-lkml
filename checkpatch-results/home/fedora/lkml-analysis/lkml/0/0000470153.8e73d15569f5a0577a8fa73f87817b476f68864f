#28: 
Seperates shmem_sb_info from struct super_block.
^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*sbinfo)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct shmem_sb_info)...)
#112: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1287:
+	sbinfo = kmalloc(sizeof(struct shmem_sb_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
