WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#23: 
This should apply to both 2.5 and 2.4. It removes the previous attempt as well.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#36: 
--- a/drivers/ide/ide-timing.h	Thu Feb  6 17:15:26 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#111: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:288:
+		t = (t & ~(3 << ((3 - dn) << 1))) | ((FIT(timing->setup, 1, 4) - 1) << ((3 - dn) << 1));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
