#28: 
The whole /proc/ipw2100/xxx interface is ugly and a mess.  It doesn't expose anything

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#40: 
--- a/include/linux/netdevice.h	Thu Mar 11 10:36:47 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
