WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'drivers' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#69: FILE: net/tulip/tulip.h:477:
+			printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: tulip_stop_rxtx() failed"

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'tulip_stop_rxtx', this function's name, in a string
#69: FILE: net/tulip/tulip.h:477:
+			printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: tulip_stop_rxtx() failed"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#70: FILE: net/tulip/tulip.h:478:
+			printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: tulip_stop_rxtx() failed"
+					" (CSR5 0x%x CSR6 0x%x)\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
