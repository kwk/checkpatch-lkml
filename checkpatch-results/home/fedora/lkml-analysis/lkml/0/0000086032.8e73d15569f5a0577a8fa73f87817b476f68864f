WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#64: 
Signed-Off-By: KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#74: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:63:
+extern int sysctl_oom_die;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#102: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:26:
+int sysctl_oom_die = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#110: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:293:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'oom_die', this function's name, in a string
#113: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:296:
+	panic("Panic: out of memory: oom_die is selected.");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
