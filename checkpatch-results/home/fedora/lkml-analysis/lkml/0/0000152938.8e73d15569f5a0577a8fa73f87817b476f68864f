WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#16: 
Subject: Re: [sparse fix] (was Re: [PATCH] bogus cast in bio.c)

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Wcast_to_address_space>
#63: FILE: evaluate.c:2056:
+	if (!Wcast_to_address_space)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#174: FILE: lib.c:173:
+int Wcast_to_address_space = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
