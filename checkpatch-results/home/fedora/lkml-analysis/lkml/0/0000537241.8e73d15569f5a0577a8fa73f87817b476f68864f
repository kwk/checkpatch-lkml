+	volatile int counter;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#97: FILE: kernel/fork.c:675:
+		int counter = current->counter >> 1;
+		current->counter = p->counter = counter;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#97: FILE: kernel/fork.c:675:
+		current->counter = p->counter = counter;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
