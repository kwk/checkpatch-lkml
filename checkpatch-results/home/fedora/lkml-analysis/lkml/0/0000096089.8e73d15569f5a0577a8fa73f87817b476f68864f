CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#134: FILE: fs/ocfs2/dlm/dlmcommon.h:39:
+#define DLM_HASH_SIZE		(1 << 18)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns

+	return dlm->lockres_hash[(i / DLM_BUCKETS_PER_PAGE) % DLM_HASH_PAGES] + i % DLM_BUCKETS_PER_PAGE;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
