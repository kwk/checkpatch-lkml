Sorry about the long Cc: list, but I wanted to make sure I included everyone

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#297: FILE: drivers/net/sb1250-mac.c:1431:
+	d->sbdma_dscrtable = d->sbdma_ctxtable = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ba' may be misspelled - perhaps 'by'?
#447: FILE: drivers/net/s2io.c:704:
+		kfree(mac_control->rings[i].ba);
 		                            ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <APList>
#492: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/airo.c:2392:
+	kfree(ai->APList);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "data->on_close"
#553: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/airo.c:5373:
+	if (data->on_close != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
