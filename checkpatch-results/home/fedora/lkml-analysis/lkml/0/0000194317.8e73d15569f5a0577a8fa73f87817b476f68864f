WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#67: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi.c:652:
+			/* fall thru */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#98: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi.c:682:
+        /* Zero the sense information from the last time we tried$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#214: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_priv.h:65:
+extern void scsi_retry_command(struct scsi_cmnd *cmd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
