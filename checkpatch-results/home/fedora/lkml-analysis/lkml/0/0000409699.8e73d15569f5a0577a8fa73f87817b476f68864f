ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#35: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/apic.c	Mon Dec  2 11:36:17 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#44: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:267:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#46: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:269:
+	return (old & ~APIC_LDR_MASK)|SET_APIC_LOGICAL_ID(id);
 	                             ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#93: FILE: include/asm-i386/smpboot.h:46:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
