WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#50: FILE: Makefile:727:
+	$(Q)$(MAKE) -f $(srctree)/scripts/Makefile.modpost $@

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
