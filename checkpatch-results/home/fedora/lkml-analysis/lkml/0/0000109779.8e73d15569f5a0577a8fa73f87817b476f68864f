ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#76: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c:851:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#84: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c:2736:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
