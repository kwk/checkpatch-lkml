The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file

+#	./bisect-mm start	mark linus.patch as good, last patch as bad

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
