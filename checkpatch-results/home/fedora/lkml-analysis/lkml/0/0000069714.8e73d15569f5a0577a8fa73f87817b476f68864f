this CRC library, I thought it best to seperate the 2 patches

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'is'

  *      The OSTA-UDF(tm) 1.50 standard states that using CRCs is mandatory.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#165: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#170: FILE: include/linux/crc-itu-t.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#189: FILE: include/linux/crc-itu-t.h:20:
+extern u16 crc_itu_t(u16 crc, const u8 *buffer, size_t len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#205: FILE: lib/Kconfig:21:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.
