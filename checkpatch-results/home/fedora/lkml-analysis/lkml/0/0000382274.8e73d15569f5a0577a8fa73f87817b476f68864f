CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "module_text_address"
#65: FILE: kernel/extable.c:41:
+	return module_text_address(addr) != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#81: FILE: kernel/module.c:559:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
