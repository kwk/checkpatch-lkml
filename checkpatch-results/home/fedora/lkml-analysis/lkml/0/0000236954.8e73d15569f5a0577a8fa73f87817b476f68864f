The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'field' may be better as '(field)' to avoid precedence issues

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#112: FILE: drivers/sh/superhyway/superhyway-sysfs.c:19:

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#118: FILE: drivers/sh/superhyway/superhyway-sysfs.c:25:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(name, S_IRUGO, superhyway_show_##name, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
