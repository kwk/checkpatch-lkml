ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+#define VA_IC_BASE^I^I __io_address(VERSATILE_VIC_BASE) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

+}
+#define __io(a)	__io(a)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
