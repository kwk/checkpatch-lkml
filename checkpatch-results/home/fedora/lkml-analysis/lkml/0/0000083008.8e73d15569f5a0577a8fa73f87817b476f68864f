WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#36: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .10
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 15)
#88: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_bt_sm.c:168:
+	if ((size < 2) || (size > (IPMI_MAX_MSG_LENGTH - 2)))
 	       return -1;

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'size < 2'
#88: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_bt_sm.c:168:
+	if ((size < 2) || (size > (IPMI_MAX_MSG_LENGTH - 2)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#127: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-i801.c:482:
+	/* Some BIOSes don't like it when PEC is enabled at reboot or resume
+	   time, so we forcibly disable it after every transaction. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#127: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-i801.c:482:
+	   time, so we forcibly disable it after every transaction. */

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#201: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/Kconfig:182:
+config MTD_NAND_SHARPSL
+	tristate "Support for NAND Flash on Sharp SL Series (C7xx + others)"

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#205: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/Kconfig:186:

 	  The simulator may simulate verious NAND flash chips for the
 	  MTD nand layer.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#234: FILE: drivers/scsi/3w-9xxx.c:1949:
+			unsigned long flags = 0;
+			local_irq_save(flags);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#461: FILE: ipc/util.c:185:
+	memcpy(new->p, ids->entries->p, sizeof(struct kern_ipc_perm *)*size);
 	                                                              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:NETWORKING_BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: networking block comments don't use an empty /* line, use /* Comment...
#622: FILE: net/ipv6/exthdrs.c:493:
+	/*
+	 * skb->nh.raw is equal to skb->data, and

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#657: FILE: net/ipv6/xfrm6_policy.c:204:
+		exthdr = (struct ipv6_opt_hdr*)(skb->nh.raw + offset);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
