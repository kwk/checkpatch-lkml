#29: 
This relocates the driver binding/unbinding code to drivers/base/dd.c. This is done

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#68: FILE: drivers/base/base.h:7:
+extern void driver_detach(struct device_driver * drv);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: drivers/base/base.h:7:
+extern void driver_detach(struct device_driver * drv);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#280: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
