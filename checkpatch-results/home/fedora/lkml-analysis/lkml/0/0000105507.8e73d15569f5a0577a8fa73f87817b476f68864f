ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#56: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1083:
+static int __initdata asus_hides_ac97 = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after asus_hides_ac97
#56: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1083:
+static int __initdata asus_hides_ac97 = 0;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 121 exceeds 100 columns
#79: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1106:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "PCI: onboard AC97/MC97 devices continue to play 'hide and seek'! 0x%x\n", val);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
