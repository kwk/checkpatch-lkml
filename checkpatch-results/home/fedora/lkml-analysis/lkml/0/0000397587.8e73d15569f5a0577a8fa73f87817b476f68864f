ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#37: FILE: kernel/fork.c:691:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#38: FILE: kernel/fork.c:691:
INIT_LIST_HEAD(&p->local_pages);

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#39: FILE: kernel/fork.c:692:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
