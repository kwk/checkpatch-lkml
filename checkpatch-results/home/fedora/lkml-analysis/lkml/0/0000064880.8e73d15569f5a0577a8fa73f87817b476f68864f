ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#44: FILE: crypto/deflate.c:145:
+^I    ^Iif (!(ret == Z_OK && !stream->avail_in && !stream->avail_out)) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#44: FILE: crypto/deflate.c:145:
+^I    ^Iif (!(ret == Z_OK && !stream->avail_in && !stream->avail_out)) {$

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#49: FILE: crypto/deflate.c:150:
+			u8 zerostuff = 0;
+			stream->next_out = &zerostuff;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#50: FILE: crypto/deflate.c:151:
+^I^I^Istream->avail_out = 1; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
