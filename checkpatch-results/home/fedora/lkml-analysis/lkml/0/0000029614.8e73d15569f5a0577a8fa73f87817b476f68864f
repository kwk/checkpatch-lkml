WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#70: FILE: net/ipv6/Kconfig:129:
+config IPV6_SIT
+	tristate "IPv6: IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel (SIT driver)"
+	depends on IPV6
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  Tunneling means encapsulating data of one protocol type within
+	  another protocol and sending it over a channel that understands the
+	  encapsulating protocol. This driver implements encapsulation of IPv6
+	  into IPv4 packets. This is useful if you want to connect two IPv6
+	  networks over an IPv4-only path.
+
+	  Saying M here will produce a module called sit.ko. If unsure, say Y.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
