ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#87: 
--- a/drivers/input/serio/serio.c	Mon Dec  1 01:15:33 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

distractions when editing files.
