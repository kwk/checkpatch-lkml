WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#115: FILE: drivers/scsi/ahci.c:670:
+			unsigned int err;
+			if (status & PORT_IRQ_TF_ERR)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cmd"
#144: FILE: drivers/scsi/libata-core.c:3432:
+	if (qc->dev->class != ATA_DEV_ATAPI || cmd == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#208: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:481:
+extern int ata_qc_atapi_timeout(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
