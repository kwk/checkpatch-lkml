ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#47: 
--- a/drivers/input/mousedev.c	Thu Dec 25 03:57:50 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#53: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:151:
+					if (code == BTN_TOUCH && test_bit(BTN_TOOL_FINGER, handle->dev->keybit)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#56: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:154:
+						if (!list->touch)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#61: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:159:
 					switch (code) {

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
