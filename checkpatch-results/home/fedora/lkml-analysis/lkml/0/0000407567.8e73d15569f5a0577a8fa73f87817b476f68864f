> I am trying to configure a notebook with a PCMCIA NIC to boot over network.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#139: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:794:
+extern void cardbus_register(pci_socket_t *socket);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#183: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:845:
+				int ret = d->op->open(socket);
+				if (ret < 0) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#203: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:858:
+	if (!socket->cb_irq || request_irq(socket->cb_irq, yenta_interrupt,
