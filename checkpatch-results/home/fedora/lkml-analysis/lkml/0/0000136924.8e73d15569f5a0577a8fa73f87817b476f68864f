#142: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:310:
+		struct sysfs_dirent * sd = file->f_dentry->d_fsdata;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dir->s_dentry"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

#230: FILE: fs/sysfs/sysfs.h:13:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
