#33: 
* Fix for sd_init failures: scsi_device.detected; zeroing of xx.dev_noticed.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#44: FILE: drivers/scsi/hosts.c:279:
+scsi_deregister_device(struct Scsi_Device_Template * tpnt)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
