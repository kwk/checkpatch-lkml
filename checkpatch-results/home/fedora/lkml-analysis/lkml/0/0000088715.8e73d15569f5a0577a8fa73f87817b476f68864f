CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#52: FILE: arch/arm/common/locomo.c:1049:
+#define LOCOMO_GPIO9        (1<<9)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#70: FILE: arch/arm/common/locomo.c:1067:
+^I        LOCOMO_GPD &= ~LOCOMO_GPIO9;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#88: FILE: arch/arm/common/locomo.c:1085:
+	if (vr) poodlefl_enable_accel();

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
