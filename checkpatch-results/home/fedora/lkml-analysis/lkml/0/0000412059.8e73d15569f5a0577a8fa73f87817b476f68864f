ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#78: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:178:
+	struct sysfs_ops * ops = file->private_data;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#78: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:178:
+	struct sysfs_ops * ops = file->private_data;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#148: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:293:
+	if (file->f_mode & FMODE_WRITE) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IWUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0222'.
#149: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:294:
+		if (!(inode->i_mode & S_IWUGO))

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
