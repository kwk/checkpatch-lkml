Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#62: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-ibm_iic.c:552:
+	struct ocp_func_iic_data* iic_data = ocp->def->additions;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
