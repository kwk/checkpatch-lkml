+	ctl = kcalloc(sizeof(*ctl), GFP_KERNEL);

The first argument for kcalloc or kmalloc_array should be the
number of elements.  sizeof() as the first argument is generally
wrong.

#99: FILE: sound/core/control.c:191:
+	kctl = kcalloc(sizeof(*kctl) + sizeof(snd_kcontrol_volatile_t) * control->count, GFP_KERNEL);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
