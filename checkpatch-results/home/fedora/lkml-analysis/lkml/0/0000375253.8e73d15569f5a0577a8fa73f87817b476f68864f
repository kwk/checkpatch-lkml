cancelation handling.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#75: 
I have tested that core dumps are valid ELF and the new segments look correct.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#162: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/signal.c:352:
+/* These symbols are defined with the addresses in the vsyscall page.
+   See vsyscall-sigreturn.S.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

+extern const char vsyscall_sysenter_start, vsyscall_sysenter_end;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
