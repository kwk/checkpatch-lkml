WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dst_entry *' should also have an identifier name
#63: FILE: include/net/dst.h:92:
+	void			(*ifdown)(struct dst_entry *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "idev"
#153: FILE: net/ipv6/route.c:163:
+	if (dev != &loopback_dev && idev != NULL && idev->dev == dev) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
