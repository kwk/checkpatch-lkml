#43: FILE: drivers/pnp/driver.c:151:
+	struct pnp_dev * pnp_dev = to_pnp_dev(dev);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
