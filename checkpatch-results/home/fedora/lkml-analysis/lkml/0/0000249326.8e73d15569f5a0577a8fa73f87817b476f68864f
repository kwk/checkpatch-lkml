WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'smc_open', this function's name, in a string
#476: FILE: drivers/net/smc91x.c:1448:
+		DBG(2, "smc_open: no valid ethernet hw addr\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:SPACING: exactly one space required after that #elif
