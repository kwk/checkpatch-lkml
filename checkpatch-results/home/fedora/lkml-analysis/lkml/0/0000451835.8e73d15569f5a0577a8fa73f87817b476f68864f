ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#38: 
--- a/drivers/base/core.c	Wed Jun  5 13:43:20 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#54: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:123:
+static int do_driver_unbind(struct device * dev, struct device_driver * drv)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#244: FILE: include/linux/device.h:121:
+extern void remove_driver(struct device_driver * drv);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
