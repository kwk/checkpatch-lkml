WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#65: FILE: fs/dquot.c:730:
+extern struct semaphore iprune_sem;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#73: FILE: fs/dquot.c:738:
+	 * inodes - otherwise some can be on the local list of prune_icache */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
