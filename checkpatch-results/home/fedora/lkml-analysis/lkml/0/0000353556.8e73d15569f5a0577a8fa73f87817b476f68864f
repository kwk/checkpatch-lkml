CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#146: FILE: include/linux/module.h:280:
+extern void __module_put_and_exit(struct module *mod, long code)

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __noreturn over __attribute__((noreturn))
#147: FILE: include/linux/module.h:281:
+	__attribute__((noreturn));

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#148: FILE: include/linux/module.h:282:
+#define module_put_and_exit(code) __module_put_and_exit(THIS_MODULE, code);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
