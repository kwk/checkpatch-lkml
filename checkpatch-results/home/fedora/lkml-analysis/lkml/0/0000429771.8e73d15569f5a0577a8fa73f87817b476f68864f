CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#59: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:1245:
+		prepare_to_wait_exclusive(&rl->wait, &wait,
+					TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#213: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:77:
+extern void FASTCALL(__lock_page(struct page *page));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#221: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:85:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
