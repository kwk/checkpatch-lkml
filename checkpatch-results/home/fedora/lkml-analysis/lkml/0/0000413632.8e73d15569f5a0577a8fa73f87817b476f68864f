ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Deamonize' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Daemonize'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#149: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:1805:
+			else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
