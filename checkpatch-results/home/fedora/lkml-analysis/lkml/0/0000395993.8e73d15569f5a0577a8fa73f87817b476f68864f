WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated
#105: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_eckd.h:8:
+ * $Revision: 1.6 $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#135: FILE: include/asm-s390/bitops.h:483:
+__constant_test_bit(int nr, const volatile unsigned long * addr) {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
