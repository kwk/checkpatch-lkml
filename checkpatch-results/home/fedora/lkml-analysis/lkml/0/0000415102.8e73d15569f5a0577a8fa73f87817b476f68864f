CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#138: FILE: include/asm-parisc/hardware.h:159:
+extern void unregister_parisc_driver(struct parisc_driver *driver);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!next->parent"
#183: FILE: arch/parisc/kernel/drivers.c:50:
+	if (next->parent == NULL) /* end of list.  back at root */

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
