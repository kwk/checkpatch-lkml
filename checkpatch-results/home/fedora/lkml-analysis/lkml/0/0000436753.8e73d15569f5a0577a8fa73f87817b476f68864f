WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'uptodate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'up-to-date'?
#26: 
safe, we need to test the uptodate state *after* taking the bh lock.
                          ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#40: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1752:
+		struct buffer_head * bh = arr[i];

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#41: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1753:
+		struct buffer_head * bh = arr[i];
+		if (buffer_uptodate(bh))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
