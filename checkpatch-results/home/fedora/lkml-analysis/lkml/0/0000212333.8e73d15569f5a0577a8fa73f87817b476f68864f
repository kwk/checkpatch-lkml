WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#67: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/poweroff.c:25:
+	if (!acpi_disabled) {
+		apci_power_offf_prepare();
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#94: FILE: drivers/base/power/shutdown.c:67:
+		extern void do_acpi_power_off_prepare(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
