Jan 10 11:35:24 gswi1164 kernel: Module yenta_socket cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in include/linux/module.h:420

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 166 exceeds 100 columns
#81: FILE: arch/i386/pci/i386.c:261:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "PCI: Device %s not available because of resource collisions (start: %08lx, end: %08lx)\n", dev->slot_name, r->start, r->end);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
