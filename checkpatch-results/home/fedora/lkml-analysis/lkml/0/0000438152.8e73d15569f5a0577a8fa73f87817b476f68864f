#53: 
   NTFS: 2.1.0 - First steps towards write support: implement file overwrite.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#85: 
--- a/Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt	Tue Aug 20 23:58:14 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#141: FILE: fs/ntfs/file.c:66:
+struct inode_operations ntfs_file_inode_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#274: FILE: fs/ntfs/inode.h:248:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
