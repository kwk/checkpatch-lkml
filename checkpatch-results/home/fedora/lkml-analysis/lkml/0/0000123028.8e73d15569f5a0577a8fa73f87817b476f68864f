WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#239: FILE: arch/cris/arch-v10/boot/compressed/misc.c:39:
+unsigned compsize; /* compressed size, used by head.S */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#751: FILE: lib/inflate.c:1006:
+	io.opos = io.bits = io.buf = io.ipos = io.itotal = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#798: FILE: lib/inflate.c:1051:
+		unsigned len = readbyte(&io);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#799: FILE: lib/inflate.c:1052:
+		unsigned len = readbyte(&io);
+		len |= readbyte(&io) << 8;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
