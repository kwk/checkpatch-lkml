WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#114: FILE: kernel/scheduler.c:748:
+	extern char __sched_text_start[], __sched_text_end[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#115: FILE: kernel/scheduler.c:749:
+	extern char __sched_text_start[], __sched_text_end[];
+	return in_lock_functions(addr) ||

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#117: FILE: kernel/scheduler.c:751:
+		(addr >= (unsigned long)__sched_text_start
+		&& addr < (unsigned long)__sched_text_end);
