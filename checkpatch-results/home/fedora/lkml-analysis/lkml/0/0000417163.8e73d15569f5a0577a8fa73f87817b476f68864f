CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#120: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:101:
 	if (dev->bus->match(dev,drv)) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#121: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:102:
+		if (drv->drvdata_size > 0) {
[...]
+		else
[...]

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#128: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:109:
+		}
+		else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

WARNING:NEEDLESS_IF: kfree(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#142: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:184:
+				BUG_ON(drv->drvdata_size != -1);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
