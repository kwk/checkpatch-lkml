CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*eventbuf)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct inotify_event)...)
#68: FILE: drivers/char/inotify.c:555:
+	eventbuf = kmalloc(sizeof(struct inotify_event) * MAX_EVENTS_AT_ONCE,

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
