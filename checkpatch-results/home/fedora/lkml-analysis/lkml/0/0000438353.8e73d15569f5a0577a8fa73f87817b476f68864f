CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!out"
#140: FILE: ipc/util.h:77:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#152: FILE: ipc/util.h:88:
+	struct kern_ipc_perm* out;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#154: FILE: ipc/util.h:90:
+        if(lid >= ids->size)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
