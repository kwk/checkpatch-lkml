Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

#240: FILE: drivers/superio/scx.c:207:
+	     i < sizeof(scx200_logical_devs) / sizeof(scx200_logical_devs[0]); ++i)

The ARRAY_SIZE(foo) macro should be preferred over
sizeof(foo)/sizeof(foo[0]) for finding number of elements in an
array.

The macro is defined in include/linux/kernel.h::

  #define ARRAY_SIZE(x) (sizeof(x) / sizeof((x)[0]))

WARNING:ARRAY_SIZE: Prefer ARRAY_SIZE(scx200_sio_ids)
#251: FILE: drivers/superio/scx.c:218:

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#268: FILE: drivers/superio/scx.c:235:
+	if (base == 0) {
+		return scx200_probe(data, 0x015C);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
