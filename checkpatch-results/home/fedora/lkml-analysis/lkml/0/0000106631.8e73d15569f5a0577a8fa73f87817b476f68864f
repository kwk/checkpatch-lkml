CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!device"
#86: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_eckd.c:237:
+	if (device == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#173: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_eckd.c:1492:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
