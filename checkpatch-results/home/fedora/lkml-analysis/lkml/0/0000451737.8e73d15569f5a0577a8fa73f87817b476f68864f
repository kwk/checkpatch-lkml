CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#107: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:431:
+extern int bio_max_iovecs(request_queue_t *q, int *iovec_size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#170: FILE: fs/bio.c:401:
+	if ((bio = bio_alloc(GFP_NOIO, nr_bvecs)) == NULL) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ';' (ctx:BxV)
