CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: struct mutex definition without comment
#59: FILE: include/asm-i386/mmu.h:13:
+	struct mutex sem;

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void' should also have an identifier name
#94: FILE: include/asm-i386/semaphore.h:74:
+fastcall void __down_sem_failed(void /* special register calling convention */);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#105: FILE: include/asm-i386/semaphore.h:84:
+static inline void down_sem(struct semaphore * sem)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
