CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#158: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/interface.c:630:
+	if (!IS_ERR(cs->tty_dev))

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#213: FILE: drivers/isdn/gigaset/proc.c:68:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(cidmode, S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR, show_cidmode, set_cidmode);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#250: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:279:
+extern struct device *tty_register_device(struct tty_driver *driver,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
