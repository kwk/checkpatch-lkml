WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#424: FILE: fs/compat_ioctl.c:2151:
+static int __deprecated get_raw32_request(struct raw_config_request *req, struct raw32_config_request __user *user_req)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
