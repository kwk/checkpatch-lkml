WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#138: FILE: net/decnet/dn_dev.c:399:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!decnet_default_device"
#181: FILE: net/decnet/dn_dev.c:614:
+	if (force || decnet_default_device == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#195: FILE: net/decnet/dn_dev.c:628:
+	if (dev == decnet_default_device) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
