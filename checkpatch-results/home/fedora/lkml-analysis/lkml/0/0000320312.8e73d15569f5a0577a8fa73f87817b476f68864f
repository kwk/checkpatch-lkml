WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#104: FILE: drivers/char/genrtc.c:479:
+static struct file_operations gen_rtc_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#116: FILE: drivers/char/genrtc.c:491:
+static struct miscdevice rtc_gen_dev =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
