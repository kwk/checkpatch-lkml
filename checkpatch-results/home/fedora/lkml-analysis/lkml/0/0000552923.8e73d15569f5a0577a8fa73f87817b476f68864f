ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#86: FILE: kernel/timer.c:313:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#88: FILE: kernel/timer.c:315:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
