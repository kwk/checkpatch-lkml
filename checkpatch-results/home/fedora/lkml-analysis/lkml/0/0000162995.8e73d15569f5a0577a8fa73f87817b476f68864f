WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#77: FILE: bttv-driver.c:83:
+extern unsigned int no_overlay;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
