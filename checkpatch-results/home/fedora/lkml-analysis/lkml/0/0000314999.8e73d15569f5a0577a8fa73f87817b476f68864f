ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#133: FILE: tmp/cdu31a.c:3333:
+^Iif (cdu31a_port == 0xffff) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#139: FILE: tmp/cdu31a.c:3339:
+		int tmp_irq = cdu31a_irq;
+		cdu31a_irq = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
