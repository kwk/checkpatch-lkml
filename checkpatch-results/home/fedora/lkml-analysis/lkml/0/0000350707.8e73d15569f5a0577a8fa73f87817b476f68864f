WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#100: FILE: drivers/net/wan/pc300_drv.c:3156:
+	if (hdlc->proto.id == IF_PROTO_PPP) {
 		d->if_ptr = &hdlc->state.ppp.pppdev;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
