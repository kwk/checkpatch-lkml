WARNING:DEPRECATED_VARIABLE: Use of EXTRA_CFLAGS is deprecated, please use `ccflags-y instead.
#86: FILE: fs/ntfs/Makefile:9:
+EXTRA_CFLAGS = -DNTFS_VERSION=\"2.1.17-WIP\"

EXTRA_{A,C,CPP,LD}FLAGS are deprecated and should be replaced by the new
flags added via commit f77bf01425b1 ("kbuild: introduce ccflags-y,
asflags-y and ldflags-y").

The following conversion scheme maybe used::

  EXTRA_AFLAGS    ->  asflags-y
  EXTRA_CFLAGS    ->  ccflags-y
  EXTRA_CPPFLAGS  ->  cppflags-y
  EXTRA_LDFLAGS   ->  ldflags-y

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
