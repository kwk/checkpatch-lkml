ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

+	} else if(!p->fontdata) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#65: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:622:
+		struct font_desc *font = NULL;
+		if (!fontname[0] || !(font = find_font(fontname)))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#65: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:622:
+		if (!fontname[0] || !(font = find_font(fontname)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#67: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:624:
+			font = get_default_font(info->var.xres,
+						   info->var.yres);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#70: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:627:
+		vc->vc_font.data = p->fontdata = font->data;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
