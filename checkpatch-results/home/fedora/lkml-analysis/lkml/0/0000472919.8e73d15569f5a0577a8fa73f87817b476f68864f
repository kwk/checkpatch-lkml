This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
