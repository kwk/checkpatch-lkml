#30: 
This catches the files I had to do by hand as Dmitry's patch differed from my tree.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#87: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:47:
+drv_attr_store(struct kobject * kobj, struct attribute * attr,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
