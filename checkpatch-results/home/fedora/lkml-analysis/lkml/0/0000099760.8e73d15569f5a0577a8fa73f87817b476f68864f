ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#52: FILE: drivers/oprofile/cpu_buffer.c:59:
+               b->buffer = vmalloc(sizeof(struct op_sample) * buffer_size);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#52: FILE: drivers/oprofile/cpu_buffer.c:59:

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer vmalloc(sizeof(*b->buffer)...) over vmalloc(sizeof(struct op_sample)...)
#52: FILE: drivers/oprofile/cpu_buffer.c:59:
+               b->buffer = vmalloc(sizeof(struct op_sample) * buffer_size);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
