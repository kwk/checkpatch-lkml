of extra work to busy CPUs, but that is only to help the idle CPU sleep longer.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tmp"
#116: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1891:
+	if (tmp == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#196: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1976:
+^I                if (unlikely(!interval))$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#259: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2236:
+		for_each_cpu_mask(i, wakemask) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
