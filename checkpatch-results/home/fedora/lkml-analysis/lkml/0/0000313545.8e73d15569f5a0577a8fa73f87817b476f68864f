ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#33: 
--- a/sound/oss/soundcard.c	Wed Jan  7 15:10:03 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#39: FILE: sound/oss/soundcard.c:76:
+extern struct class sound_class;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#47: FILE: sound/oss/soundcard.c:573:
+^I^Isimple_add_class_device(&sound_class, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#74: FILE: sound/oss/soundcard.c:609:
+			simple_remove_class_device(MKDEV(SOUND_MAJOR, dev_list[i].minor + (j*0x10)));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
