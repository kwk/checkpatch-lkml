CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#101: FILE: include/linux/smp_lock.h:10:
+extern int kernel_locked(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#120: FILE: include/linux/hardirq.h:30:
+#define in_atomic()		((preempt_count() & ~PREEMPT_ACTIVE) != 0)

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#160: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2314:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_locked);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#220: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2374:
+	BUG_ON(task->lock_depth < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
