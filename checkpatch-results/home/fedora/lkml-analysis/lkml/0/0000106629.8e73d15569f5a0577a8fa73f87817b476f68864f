CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/smp.h> instead of <asm/smp.h>
#56: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/machine_kexec.c:24:
+#include <asm/smp.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#68: FILE: include/asm-s390/smp.h:104:
 }
+#define smp_cpu_not_running(cpu)	1

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
