ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#55: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:154:
+static int compute_loop_size(struct loop_device *lo, struct dentry * lo_dentry, kdev_t lodev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#62: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:879:
+		err = put_user((unsigned long)loop_sizes[lo->lo_number] << 1, (unsigned long *) arg);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#69: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:1021:

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.
