WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#47: FILE: include/asm-i386/uaccess.h:46:
+int FASTCALL(__fixmap_range_ok(unsigned long, unsigned long));

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

spaces are never used for indentation.
