#21: 
This patch *tries* to do some cleanup in the adlib_card.c & opl3.c files in current 2.4

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#63: FILE: drivers/sound/adlib_card.c:23:
+	int ret = -1;
+	ret = opl3_modinit(hw_config->io_base, hw_config->osp, THIS_MODULE);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#64: FILE: drivers/sound/adlib_card.c:24:
+	if (ret == -1)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Example::

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
