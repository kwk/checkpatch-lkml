#93: FILE: fs/smbfs/proc.c:749:
+	/* Make sure we can fit a message of the negotiated size in our
+	   packet buffer. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#97: FILE: fs/smbfs/proc.c:753:
+		char *buf = smb_vmalloc(len);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#103: FILE: fs/smbfs/proc.c:759:
+			PARANOIA("Failed to allocate new packet buffer: "
+				 "max_xmit=%d, packet_size=%d\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SMBwrite>
#117: FILE: fs/smbfs/proc.c:1362:
+	p = smb_setup_header(server, SMBwrite, 5, 3);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#131: FILE: fs/smbfs/proc.c:1371:
+	if ((result = smb_request_ok(server, SMBwrite, 1, 0)) < 0) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#337: FILE: fs/smbfs/sock.c:786:
+        if (err >= 0) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
