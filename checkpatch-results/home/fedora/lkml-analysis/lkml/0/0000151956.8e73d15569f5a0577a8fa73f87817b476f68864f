#26: 
This patch, against 2.6.13-mm3, replaces kmalloc and memset with kzalloc in drivers/base/* .

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'swaped' may be misspelled - perhaps 'swapped'?
#31: 
  The memset arguments were occasionally swaped and therefore wrong.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pobj)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct platform_object)...)
#212: FILE: drivers/base/platform.c:228:
+	pobj = kzalloc(sizeof(struct platform_object) + sizeof(struct resource) * num, GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
