Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#232: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1513:
+	runqueue_t *rq = this_rq();
+	finish_task_switch(rq, prev);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#439: FILE: include/asm-sparc64/system.h:144:
+#define prepare_arch_switch(next)		\
+do {						\
 	flushw_all();				\
 } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
