#32: 
I'm sending this fix for /dev/kmem; I already sent a cleanup about this, but 

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#79: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:292:
+			towrite = (unsigned long) high_memory - p;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#82: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:294:
+		wrote = do_write_mem(file, (void*)p, p, buf, towrite, ppos);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
