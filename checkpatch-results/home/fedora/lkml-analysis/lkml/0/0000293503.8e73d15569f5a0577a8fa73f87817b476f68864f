Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#121: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/setup.c:475:
+	extern int __adb_probe_sync;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#122: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/setup.c:476:
+	extern int __adb_probe_sync;
+	__adb_probe_sync = 1;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
