The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#84: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/proto.h:120:
+extern int dma_broken_dac(struct device *dev);	/* arch/i386/kernel/quirks.c */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
