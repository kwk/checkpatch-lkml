CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#115: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:112:
+extern int drain_local_pages(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#202: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:637:
+		return drain_local_pages();
+	} else {

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#257: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:993:
+		page = get_page_from_freelist(gfp_mask, order, zonelist,
+						alloc_flags);
