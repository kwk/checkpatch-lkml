CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sense"
#68: FILE: block/ide-cd.c:333:
+	if (sense == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#71: FILE: block/ide-cd.c:336:
+	switch (sense->sense_key) {
+		case NO_SENSE: case RECOVERED_ERROR:
[...]
+		case NOT_READY:
[...]
+		case UNIT_ATTENTION:
[...]
+		default:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#131: FILE: block/ide-cd.c:369:
 {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
