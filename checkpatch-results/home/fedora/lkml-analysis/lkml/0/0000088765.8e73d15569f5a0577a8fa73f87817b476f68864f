WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'overrideable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'overridable'?
#25: 
Some string functions were safely overrideable in lib/string.c, but
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'overrideable' may be misspelled - perhaps 'overridable'?
#27: 
Correct this, and make strcspn overrideable.
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#57: FILE: include/linux/string.h:69:
+extern char * strpbrk(const char *,const char *);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: include/linux/string.h:69:
+extern char * strpbrk(const char *,const char *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
