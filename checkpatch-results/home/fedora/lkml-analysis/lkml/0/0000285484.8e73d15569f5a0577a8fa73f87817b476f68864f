CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ioc"
#53: FILE: drivers/block/as-iosched.c:227:
+	if (ioc == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#55: FILE: drivers/block/as-iosched.c:229:
+        if (ioc->aic && ioc->aic->dtor)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#59: FILE: drivers/block/as-iosched.c:233:
+	
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
