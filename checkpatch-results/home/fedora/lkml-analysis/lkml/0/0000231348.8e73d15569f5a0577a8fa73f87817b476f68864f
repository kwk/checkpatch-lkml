WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#72: FILE: arch/x86_64/Kconfig:355:
+config X86_MCE_INTEL
+	bool "Intel MCE features"
+	depends on X86_MCE
+	default y
+	help
+	   Additional support for intel specific MCE features such as
+	   the thermal monitor.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#127: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/i8259.c:494:
+void thermal_interrupt(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#140: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/i8259.c:551:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#192: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/mce_intel.c:8:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
