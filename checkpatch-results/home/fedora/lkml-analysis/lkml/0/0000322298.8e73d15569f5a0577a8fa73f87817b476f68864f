WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 159 exceeds 100 columns
#42: FILE: drivers/acpi/thermal.c:463:
+		printk(KERN_ALERT "Are you running CPU or nuclear power plant? ACPI claims CPU temp is %d C. Ignoring.\n", KELVIN_TO_CELSIUS(tz->temperature));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
