# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#65: 
--- a/Documentation/DMA-API.txt	Mon Jan 13 11:06:42 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#110: FILE: include/asm-generic/dma-mapping.h:36:
+	BUG_ON(dev->bus != &pci_bus_type || (flag & GFP_ATOMIC) != GFP_ATOMIC);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hwdev"
#131: FILE: include/asm-generic/pci-dma-compat.h:22:
+	return dma_alloc_coherent(hwdev == NULL ? NULL : &hwdev->dev, size, dma_handle, GFP_ATOMIC);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <pScript>
#251: FILE: drivers/scsi/53c700.c:249:
+				       &pScript, GFP_KERNEL);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
