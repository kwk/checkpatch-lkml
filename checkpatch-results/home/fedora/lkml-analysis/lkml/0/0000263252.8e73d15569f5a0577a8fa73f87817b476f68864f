CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/smp.h> instead of <asm/smp.h>
#53: FILE: arch/s390/appldata/appldata_base.c:20:
+#include <asm/smp.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#92: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/compat_linux.h:217:
+extern int copy_siginfo_to_user32(siginfo_t32 __user *to, siginfo_t *from);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#115: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/compat_signal.c:121:
+	if (from->si_code < 0)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
