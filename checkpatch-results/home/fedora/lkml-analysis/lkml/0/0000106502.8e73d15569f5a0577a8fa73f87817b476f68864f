Subject: [PATCH 6/8] drivers/s390 misc sparse annotations

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#561: FILE: drivers/s390/char/vmlogrdr.c:518:
+vmlogrdr_read (struct file *filp, char __user *data, size_t count, loff_t * ppos)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#587: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/ccwgroup.c:323:
+	value = simple_strtoul(buf, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
