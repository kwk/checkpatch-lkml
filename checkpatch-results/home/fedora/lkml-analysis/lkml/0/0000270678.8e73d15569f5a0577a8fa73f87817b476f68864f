ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#73: FILE: kernel/exit.c:601:
+static inline void forget_original_parent(struct task_struct * father,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#89: FILE: kernel/exit.c:625:
+			BUG_ON(!p->ptrace);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#90: FILE: kernel/exit.c:626:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#92: FILE: kernel/exit.c:628:
+				if (p->exit_signal == -1) {
[...]
+				else if (thread_group_empty(p))
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#101: FILE: kernel/exit.c:637:
+				}
+				else if (thread_group_empty(p))

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
