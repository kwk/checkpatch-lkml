#38: 
    Input: adbhid - fix OOPS introduced by dynalloc conversion (Paul Mackerras)

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#61: FILE: drivers/input/evdev.c:568:
+						case EV_SW:  bits = dev->swbit;  max = SW_MAX;  break;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#61: FILE: drivers/input/evdev.c:568:
+						case EV_SW:  bits = dev->swbit;  max = SW_MAX;  break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
