ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#28: 
--- a/drivers/pci/pm.c	2005-11-08 17:10:37.000000000 -0500

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#35: FILE: drivers/pci/pm.c:303:
+	dev->pm = pm_data = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pci_dev_pm), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pm_data)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pci_dev_pm)...)
#35: FILE: drivers/pci/pm.c:303:
+	dev->pm = pm_data = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pci_dev_pm), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
