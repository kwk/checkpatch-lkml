ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#49: 
--- a/fs/exec.c	Wed May 29 11:43:02 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#59: FILE: fs/exec.c:396:
+	struct mm_struct * old_mm, *active_mm;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#110: FILE: fs/exec.c:413:
+		if (active_mm != old_mm) BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#110: FILE: fs/exec.c:413:
+		if (active_mm != old_mm) BUG();

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#154: FILE: fs/exec.c:899:
+	if ((retval = bprm.argc) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
