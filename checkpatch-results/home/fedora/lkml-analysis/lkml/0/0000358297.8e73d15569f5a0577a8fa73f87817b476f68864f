WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated
#267: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/requestirq.c:4:
+ *   $Revision: 1.45 $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#275: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/requestirq.c:48:
+	if (MACHINE_NEW_STIDP)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

+#define R_390_TLS_GOTIE20	60	/* 20 bit GOT offset for static TLS

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
