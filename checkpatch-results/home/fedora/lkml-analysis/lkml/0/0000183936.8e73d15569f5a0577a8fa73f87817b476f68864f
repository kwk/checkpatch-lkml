CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#712: FILE: linux-2.6.12-rc4-mm1/include/asm-frv/pci.h:32:
+extern void pcibios_penalize_isa_irq(int irq, int active);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
