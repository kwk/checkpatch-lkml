#27: 
PCI Hotplug: use the new decl_subsys_name() macro instead of rolling our own.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/drivers/pci/hotplug/pci_hotplug_core.c	Mon Mar 15 15:29:01 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
