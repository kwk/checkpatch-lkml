violate POSIX a little before you die horribly from being out of memory anyway.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!q"
#74: FILE: kernel/signal.c:273:
+	if (unlikely(q == NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#91: FILE: kernel/signal.c:801:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::
