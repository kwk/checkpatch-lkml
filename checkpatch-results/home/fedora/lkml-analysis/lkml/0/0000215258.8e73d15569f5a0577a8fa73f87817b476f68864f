CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*vc)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct vc_data)...)
#111: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:707:
+	    vc = kmalloc(sizeof(struct vc_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vc"
#161: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:1914:
+	if (vc == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#282: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:2549:
+		vc_cons[currcons].d = vc = alloc_bootmem(sizeof(struct vc_data));

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#403: FILE: drivers/char/vt_ioctl.c:487:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#432: FILE: drivers/char/vt_ioctl.c:672:
+^I^Ivc->vt_newvt = -1; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#469: FILE: drivers/char/vt_ioctl.c:775:
+			else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
