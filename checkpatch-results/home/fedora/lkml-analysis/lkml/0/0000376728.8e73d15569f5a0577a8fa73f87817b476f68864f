WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#100: FILE: drivers/block/elevator.c:293:
+if(!q->elevator.elevator_add_req_fn) printk(KERN_INFO "Duh. Elevator %p not initialized.\n", q);
 	q->elevator.elevator_add_req_fn(q, rq, insert);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Statements, such as::

should be::

  if (x == y)

#138: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:1432:
+printk(KERN_INFO "ata_attach: trying driver %p for drive %s(%p).\n", driver, drive->name, &drive->queue);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
