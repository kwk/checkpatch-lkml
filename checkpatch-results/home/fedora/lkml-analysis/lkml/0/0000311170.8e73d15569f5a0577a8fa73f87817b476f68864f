WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#51: FILE: init/main.c:292:
+extern struct exception_table_entry __start___ex_table[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+/* When an exception handler is in an non standard section (like __init)

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#69: FILE: init/main.c:310:
+				struct exception_table_entry tmp = e[-1];
+				e[-1] = e[0];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
