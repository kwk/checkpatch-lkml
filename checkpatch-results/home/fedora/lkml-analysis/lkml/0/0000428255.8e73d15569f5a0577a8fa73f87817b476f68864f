CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/linux/vmalloc.h:35:
+extern struct vm_struct *__get_vm_area(unsigned long size, unsigned long flags, int gfp_mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'contingous' may be misspelled - perhaps 'contiguous'?
#60: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:184:
+ *	__get_vm_area  -  reserve a contingous kernel virtual area
