Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#215: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:658:
+	psmouse->pktcnt = psmouse->out_of_sync = psmouse->resend = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
