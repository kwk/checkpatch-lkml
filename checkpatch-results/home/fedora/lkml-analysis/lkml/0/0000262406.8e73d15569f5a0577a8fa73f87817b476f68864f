WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#91: FILE: arch/x86_64/lib/spinlock.c:1:
+#include <linux/module.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
