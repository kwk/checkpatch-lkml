ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

+	  You can say N here if you don't intend to connect your Linux box to
+	  any other computer at all or if all your connections will be over a
+	  telephone line with a modem either via UUCP (UUCP is a protocol to
+	  forward mail and news between unix hosts over telephone lines; read
+	  the UUCP-HOWTO, available from
+	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>) or dialing up a shell

+	  almost full Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up
+	  shell account on some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
+	  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>).
+
+	  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains a network card that
+	  you want to use under Linux (make sure you know its name because you
+	  will be asked for it and read the Ethernet-HOWTO (especially if you
+	  plan to use more than one network card under Linux)) or if you want
+	  to use SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol is the protocol used to
+	  send Internet traffic over telephone lines or null modem cables) or
+	  CSLIP (compressed SLIP) or PPP (Point to Point Protocol, a better
+	  and newer replacement for SLIP) or PLIP (Parallel Line Internet
+	  Protocol is mainly used to create a mini network by connecting the
+	  parallel ports of two local machines) or AX.25/KISS (protocol for
+	  sending Internet traffic over amateur radio links).
+
+	  Make sure to read the NET-3-HOWTO. Eventually, you will have to read
+	  Olaf Kirch's excellent and free book "Network Administrator's
+	  Guide", to be found in <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#guide>. If

it.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#918: FILE: net/Kconfig:7:
+config NET
+	bool "Networking support"
+	---help---
+	  Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here.
+	  The reason is that some programs need kernel networking support even
+	  when running on a stand-alone machine that isn't connected to any
+	  other computer. If you are upgrading from an older kernel, you
+	  should consider updating your networking tools too because changes
+	  in the kernel and the tools often go hand in hand. The tools are
+	  contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number
+	  of which are given in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
+
+	  For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly
+	  recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from
+	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#941: FILE: net/Kconfig:573:
+source "drivers/net/Kconfig"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
