Subject: Re: [patch 07/10 with proper signed-off] arch/i386/kernel/traps.c: fix sparse warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one
