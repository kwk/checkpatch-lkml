#24: 
The patch allows physical bring-up of new processors (not initially present in the configuration) from facilities such as driver/utility implemented on a platform. The actual method of making processors available is up to the platform implementation.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinitdata is unnecessary
#42: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:73:
+static unsigned int __devinitdata num_processors;

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __devinitdata should be placed after num_processors
#42: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:73:
+static unsigned int __devinitdata num_processors;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
