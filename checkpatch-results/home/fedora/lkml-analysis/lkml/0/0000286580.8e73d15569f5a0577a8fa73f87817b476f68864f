WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#76: FILE: mm/swap.c:44:
+			void (*destructor)(struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#77: FILE: mm/swap.c:45:
+			void (*destructor)(struct page *);
+			destructor = (void (*)(struct page *))page[1].mapping;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#78: FILE: mm/swap.c:46:
+			BUG_ON(!destructor);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
