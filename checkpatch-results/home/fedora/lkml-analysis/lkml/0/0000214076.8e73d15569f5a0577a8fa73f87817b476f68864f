#28: 
This patch moves the memory allocation required by kprobes outside spin lock

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*kip)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct kprobe_insn_page)...)
#134: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/kprobes.c:438:
+	kip = kmalloc(sizeof(struct kprobe_insn_page), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#140: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/kprobes.c:443:
+		GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_HIGHMEM, __pgprot(__PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC));
 		          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#151: FILE: include/linux/kprobes.h:98:
+extern void arch_copy_kprobe(struct kprobe *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#165: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:81:
+	if ((ret = arch_prepare_kprobe(p)) != 0) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#165: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:81:
+	if ((ret = arch_prepare_kprobe(p)) != 0) {
+		goto out;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
