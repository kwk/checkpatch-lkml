Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#59: FILE: kernel/module.c:919:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#61: FILE: kernel/module.c:921:
+                   .modname section. --RR */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#61: FILE: kernel/module.c:921:
+		/* FIXME: With module post-link phase, always insert
+                   .modname section. --RR */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#61: FILE: kernel/module.c:921:
+                   .modname section. --RR */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#63: FILE: kernel/module.c:923:
+		static unsigned int num_unknown;
+		sprintf(mod->name, "unknown%u", num_unknown++);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
