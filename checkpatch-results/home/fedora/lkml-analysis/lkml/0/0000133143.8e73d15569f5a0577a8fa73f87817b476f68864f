That find check is somewhat incorrect (hard link count can be legally modified 

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 264 exceeds 100 columns
#79: FILE: find/find.c:1814:
+		  error(0, 0, _("WARNING: Hard link count (%d) is wrong for %s: this may be a bug in your filesystem driver.  Automatically turning on find's -noleaf option.  Earlier results may have failed to include directories that should have been searched."),

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
