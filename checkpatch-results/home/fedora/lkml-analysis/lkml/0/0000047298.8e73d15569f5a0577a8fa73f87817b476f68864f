Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)
