CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#508: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device_pgid.c:370:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#589: FILE: drivers/s390/s390mach.c:120:

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern void cio_reset_channel_paths(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
