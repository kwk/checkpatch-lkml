ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

+int driver_for_each_device(struct device_driver * drv, struct device * start,

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#51: FILE: drivers/base/driver.c:32:
+int driver_for_each_device(struct device_driver * drv, struct device * start,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
