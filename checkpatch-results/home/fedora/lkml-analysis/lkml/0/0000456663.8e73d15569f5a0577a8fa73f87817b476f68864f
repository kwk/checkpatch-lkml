CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#62: FILE: fs/inode.c:678:
+	count = pass = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#72: FILE: fs/inode.c:683:
+		while (entry != &inode_unused)
+		{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
