ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#101: FILE: kernel/timer.c:431:
TVN_MASK

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#104: FILE: kernel/timer.c:434:
+static void * recent_fns[FN_CACHE_SIZE];

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#114: FILE: kernel/timer.c:470:
+			if (unlikely(test_suspend_state(SUSPEND_TIMER_FREEZER_ON) &&
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#116: FILE: kernel/timer.c:471:
+			if (unlikely(test_suspend_state(SUSPEND_TIMER_FREEZER_ON) &&
+				int shown = 0, i, copy_start = 0;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#117: FILE: kernel/timer.c:472:
+				int shown = 0, i, copy_start = 0;
+				for (i = 0; i < FN_CACHE_SIZE; i++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#124: FILE: kernel/timer.c:479:
+					recent_fns[i] = recent_fns[i+1];
 					                            ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
