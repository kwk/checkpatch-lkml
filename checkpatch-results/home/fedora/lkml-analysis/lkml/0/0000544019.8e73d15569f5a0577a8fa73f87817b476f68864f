+	struct list_head mmlist;		/* List of all active mm's.  These are globally strung

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#244: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:126:
+		pte_t * pte;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
