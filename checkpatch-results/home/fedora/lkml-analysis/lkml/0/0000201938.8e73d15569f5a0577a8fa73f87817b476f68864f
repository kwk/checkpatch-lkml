CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#193: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:840:
+	dir->i_mtime = dir->i_atime = CURRENT_TIME_SEC;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#202: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:849:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(fat_remove_entries);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#310: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:927:
+	old_sinfo.bh = dotdot_bh = NULL;

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#398: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs.h:336:
+extern int fat_remove_entries(struct inode *dir, struct fat_slot_info *sinfo);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
