Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#32: 
In anticipation that only the policy implementation will know anything about

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#93: FILE: mm/useonce.c:94:
+		struct zone *zone = page_zone(page);
+		spin_lock_irq(&zone->lru_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#138: FILE: mm/useonce.c:139:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#266: FILE: include/linux/mm_use_once_policy.h:79:
+extern int isolate_lru_pages(int nr_to_scan, struct list_head *src,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#280: FILE: include/linux/mm_page_replace.h:92:
+extern int page_replace_isolate(struct page *p);

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#282: FILE: include/linux/mm_page_replace.h:94:
+static inline int page_replace_isolate(struct page *p) { return -ENOSYS; }

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
