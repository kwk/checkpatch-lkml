CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#37: FILE: include/linux/netfilter_ipv4/ip_conntrack.h:239:
+extern void ip_conntrack_put(struct ip_conntrack *ct);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
