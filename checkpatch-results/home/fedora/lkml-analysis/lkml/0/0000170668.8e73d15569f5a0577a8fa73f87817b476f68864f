Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)
