+config SYSCTL

+	default y
+	---help---
+	  The sysctl interface provides a means of dynamically changing
+	  certain kernel parameters and variables on the fly without requiring
+	  a recompile of the kernel or reboot of the system.  The primary
+	  interface consists of a system call, but if you say Y to "/proc
+	  file system support", a tree of modifiable sysctl entries will be
+	  generated beneath the /proc/sys directory. They are explained in the
+	  files in <file:Documentation/sysctl/>.  Note that enabling this
+	  option will enlarge the kernel by at least 8 KB.
+
+	  As it is generally a good thing, you should say Y here unless
+	  building a kernel for install/rescue disks or your system is very
+	  limited in memory.
