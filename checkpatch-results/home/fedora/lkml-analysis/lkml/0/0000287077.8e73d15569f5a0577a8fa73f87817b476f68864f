CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: fs/sysfs/sysfs.h:15:
+extern int sysfs_readlink(struct dentry *, char __user *, int );

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dentry *' should also have an identifier name
#91: FILE: fs/sysfs/sysfs.h:15:
+extern int sysfs_readlink(struct dentry *, char __user *, int );

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#134: FILE: fs/sysfs/symlink.c:11:
+static struct inode_operations sysfs_symlink_inode_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#194: FILE: fs/sysfs/symlink.c:70:
+	if (!IS_ERR(d)) {
[...]
+	} else 
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRWXUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0777'.
#195: FILE: fs/sysfs/symlink.c:71:
+		error = sysfs_create(d, S_IFLNK|S_IRWXUGO, init_symlink);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
