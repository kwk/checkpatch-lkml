CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "base"
#64: FILE: include/linux/timer.h:26:
+	return base != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#108: FILE: kernel/timer.c:95:
+static inline void __set_base(struct timer_list *timer,
+				tvec_base_t *base, int pending)

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#168: FILE: kernel/timer.c:318:
+ ^Ibase = __get_base(timer);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#168: FILE: kernel/timer.c:318:
+ ^Ibase = __get_base(timer);$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#168: FILE: kernel/timer.c:318:
+ ^Ibase = __get_base(timer);$

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#190: FILE: kernel/timer.c:432:
+		BUG_ON(__get_base(tmp) != base);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
