CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#40: FILE: arch/arm/oprofile/op_arm_model.h:27:
+extern int __init pmu_init(struct oprofile_operations *ops, struct op_arm_model_spec *spec);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
