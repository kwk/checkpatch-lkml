ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros starting with if should be enclosed by a do - while loop to avoid possible if/else logic defects
#73: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1906:
+#define SLEEP_ON_BKLCHECK				\
+	if (unlikely(!kernel_locked()) &&		\
+	    sleep_on_bkl_warnings < 10) {		\
+		sleep_on_bkl_warnings++;		\
+		WARN_ON(1);				\
+	}

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)
