ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#31: 
--- a/drivers/char/misc.c	Fri Apr 18 15:56:44 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#56: FILE: drivers/char/misc.c:199:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#58: FILE: drivers/char/misc.c:201:
+	/* yuck, yet another stupid special-casing.  We should rather
+	   add ->devfs_name to avoid this mess. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#58: FILE: drivers/char/misc.c:201:
+	   add ->devfs_name to avoid this mess. */

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#62: FILE: drivers/char/misc.c:205:
+	misc->devfs_handle = devfs_register(NULL, buf, 0,
+			MISC_MAJOR, misc->minor,

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0640'.
#63: FILE: drivers/char/misc.c:206:
+			S_IFCHR | S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
