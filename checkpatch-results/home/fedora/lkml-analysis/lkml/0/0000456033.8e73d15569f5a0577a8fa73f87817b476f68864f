WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

+	if (!access_ok (VERIFY_WRITE, to, sizeof(siginfo_t)))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#592: FILE: kernel/signal.c:944:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#596: FILE: kernel/signal.c:948:
+		/* If you change siginfo_t structure, please be sure
+		   this code is fixed accordingly.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#599: FILE: kernel/signal.c:951:
+		   3 ints plus the relevant union member.  */
