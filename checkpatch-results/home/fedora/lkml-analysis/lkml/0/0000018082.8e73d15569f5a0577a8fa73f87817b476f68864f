CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#110: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:622:
+extern void pci_no_msi(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#129: FILE: drivers/acpi/bus.c:642:
