WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'uneeded' may be misspelled - perhaps 'unneeded'?
#55: 
an uneeded error for people using eject -r that isn't patched to open
   ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#69: FILE: block/scsi_ioctl.c:445:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 112 exceeds 100 columns
#71: FILE: block/scsi_ioctl.c:447:
+static int __blk_send_generic(struct file *file, request_queue_t *q, struct gendisk *bd_disk, int cmd, int data)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#92: FILE: block/scsi_ioctl.c:468:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
