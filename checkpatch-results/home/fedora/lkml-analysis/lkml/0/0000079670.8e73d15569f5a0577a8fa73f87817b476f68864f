+ 	---help---
+ 	  This driver provides kernel-side support for the Random Number
+	  Generator hardware found on OMAP16xx and OMAP24xx multimedia
+	  processors.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

+
+ 	  If unsure, say Y.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#159: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/omap-rng.c:96:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#161: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/omap-rng.c:98:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#168: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/omap-rng.c:105:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mem"
#180: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/omap-rng.c:117:
+	if (mem == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#194: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/omap-rng.c:131:
+	dev_info(dev, "OMAP Random Number Generator ver. %02x\n",
+		omap_rng_read_reg(RNG_REV_REG));

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#244: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/omap-rng.c:181:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
