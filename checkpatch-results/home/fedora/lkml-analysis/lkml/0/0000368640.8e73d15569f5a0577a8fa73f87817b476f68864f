ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#32: 
--- a/drivers/usb/misc/speedtch.c	Wed May 21 00:40:55 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#40: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/speedtch.c:171:
+	unsigned char cell_header [ATM_CELL_HEADER];

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#50: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/speedtch.c:486:
+		BUG_ON (--ctrl->num_cells);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#50: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/speedtch.c:486:
+		BUG_ON (--ctrl->num_cells);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around '&instance->sndqueue'
#81: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/speedtch.c:721:
+	if (!instance->current_skb && !(instance->current_skb = skb_dequeue (&instance->sndqueue)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#81: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/speedtch.c:721:
+	if (!instance->current_skb && !(instance->current_skb = skb_dequeue (&instance->sndqueue)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
