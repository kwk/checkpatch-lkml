CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#183: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs.h:353:
+	fatent->bhs[0] = fatent->bhs[1] = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
