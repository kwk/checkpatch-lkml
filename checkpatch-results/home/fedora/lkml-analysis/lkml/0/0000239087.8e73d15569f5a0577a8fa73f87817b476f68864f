WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#82: FILE: fs/read_write.c:549:
+	if (ret > 0) {
+		current->rchar += ret;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#136: FILE: kernel/fork.c:998:
+	p->rchar = p->wchar = p->syscr = p->syscw = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
