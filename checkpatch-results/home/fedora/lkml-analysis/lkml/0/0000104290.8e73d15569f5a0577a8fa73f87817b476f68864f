WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+ * non-zero to, we get the latter behaviour. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config LP_CONSOLE_STRICT
+    bool "Wait for a ready printer"

+    default y
+    ---help---
+      With this option enabled, if the printer is out of paper (or off,
+      or unplugged, or too busy..) the kernel will stall until the printer
+      is ready again. By turning this option off (at your own risk), you
+      can make the kernel continue when this happens, but it will lose
+      some kernel messages.
+
+      If unsure, say Y

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
