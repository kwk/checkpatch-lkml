WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 131 exceeds 100 columns
#50: FILE: ax25/af_ax25.c:210:
+		if (ax25cmp(&s->source_addr, src_addr) == 0 && ax25cmp(&s->dest_addr, dest_addr) == 0 && s->ax25_dev->dev == dev) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "digi"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
