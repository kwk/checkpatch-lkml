Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#51: FILE: crypto/cipher.c:242:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ops->cit_iv"
#65: FILE: crypto/cipher.c:278:
+		if (ops->cit_iv == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
