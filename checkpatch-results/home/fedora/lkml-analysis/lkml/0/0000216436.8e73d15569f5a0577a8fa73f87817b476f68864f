CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/numa.h:11:
+extern int compute_hash_shift(struct node *nodes, int numnodes);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#96: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/numa.c:189:
+ ^Imemnode_shift = compute_hash_shift(nodes, numa_fake);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#96: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/numa.c:189:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
