WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#56: FILE: fs/nfs/client.c:235:
+static struct nfs_client *__nfs_find_client(const struct sockaddr_in *addr, int nfsversion, int match_port)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "clp"
#87: FILE: fs/nfs/client.c:274:
+	if (clp != NULL && clp->cl_cons_state != NFS_CS_READY) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
