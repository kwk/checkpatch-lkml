WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#169: FILE: arch/s390/lib/uaccess_pt.c:22:
+	if (in_atomic())

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.
