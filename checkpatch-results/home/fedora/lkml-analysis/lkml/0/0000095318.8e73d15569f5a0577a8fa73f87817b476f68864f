ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#76: FILE: arch/ia64/oprofile/perfmon.c:23:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#82: FILE: arch/ia64/oprofile/perfmon.c:28:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#102: FILE: arch/ia64/oprofile/perfmon.c:85:
+int __init op_perfmon_init(struct oprofile_operations * ops)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#131: FILE: arch/ia64/oprofile/init.c:16:
+extern void op_perfmon_exit(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
