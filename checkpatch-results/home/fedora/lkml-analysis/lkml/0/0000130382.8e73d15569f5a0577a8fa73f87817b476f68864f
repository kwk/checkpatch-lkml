#24: 
This slightly changes the overrun handling. Instead of initially initializing

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#64: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:410:
+		info->si_overrun = timr->it_overrun_last = timr->it_overrun;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
