ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

#71: FILE: arch/i386/Kconfig:1353:
+config DEBUG_SYMBOLS_PROMPT

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
