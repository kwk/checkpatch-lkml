CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#78: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:1706:
+	current->bwtime += (unsigned long) jiffies - start_wait;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#116: FILE: fs/read_write.c:549:
+	if (ret > 0) {
+		current->rchar += ret;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#127: FILE: fs/read_write.c:571:
+	if (ret > 0) {
+		current->wchar += ret;
+	}

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#156: FILE: kernel/fork.c:967:
+	p->rchar = p->wchar = p->syscr = p->syscw = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#170: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:527:
+        unsigned long rchar, wchar, syscr, syscw, bwtime;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#170: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:527:
+        unsigned long rchar, wchar, syscr, syscw, bwtime;$
