Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#81: FILE: drivers/media/video/meye.c:1424:
+static int __init meye_setup(char *str) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#85: FILE: drivers/media/video/meye.c:1428:
+^Iif (ints[0] <= 0) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
