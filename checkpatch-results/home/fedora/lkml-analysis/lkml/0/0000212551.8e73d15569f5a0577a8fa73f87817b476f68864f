WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#125: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:147:
+	E(PROC_TGID_SMAPS,     "smaps",   S_IFREG|S_IRUGO),

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#141: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:481:
+extern struct seq_operations proc_pid_smaps_op;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#141: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:481:
+extern struct seq_operations proc_pid_smaps_op;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#230: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:162:
+	if (mm) {
+		resident_mem_size(mm, map->vm_start, map->vm_end, &rss);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
