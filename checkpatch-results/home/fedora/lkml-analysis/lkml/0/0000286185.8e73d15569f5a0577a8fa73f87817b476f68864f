WARNING:ENOTSUPP: ENOTSUPP is not a SUSV4 error code, prefer EOPNOTSUPP
#42: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsproc.c:591:
+		{ nfserr_notsupp, -ENOTSUPP },

ENOTSUPP is not a standard error code and should be avoided in new patches.
EOPNOTSUPP should be used instead.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20200510182252.GA411829@lunn.ch/

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#59: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/svc.h:238:
+	struct svc_program *	pg_next;	/* other programs (same xprt) */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!progp"
#76: FILE: net/sunrpc/svc.c:332:
+	if (progp == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
