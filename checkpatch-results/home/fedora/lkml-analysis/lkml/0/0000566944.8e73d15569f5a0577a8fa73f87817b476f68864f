WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#81: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:387:
+extern wait_queue_head_t log_wait;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - int no_spinlocks() should probably be int no_spinlocks(void)
#98: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:405:
+int no_spinlocks()

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

#109: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:416:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation
