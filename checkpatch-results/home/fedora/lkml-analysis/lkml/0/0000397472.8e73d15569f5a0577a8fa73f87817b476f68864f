 pci_irq-0295 [15] acpi_pci_irq_derive   : Unable to derive IRQ for device 00:02.0

#64: 
The following patch sould fix it, but is for now untested:
                    ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#73: FILE: drivers/acpi/pci_irq.c:354:
 		}
+		else {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#73: FILE: drivers/acpi/pci_irq.c:354:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
