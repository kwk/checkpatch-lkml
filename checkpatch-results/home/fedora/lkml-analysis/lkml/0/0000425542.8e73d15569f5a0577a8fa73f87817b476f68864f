WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#160: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:477:
+	BUG_ON (max_pfn != num_physpages);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#160: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:477:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
