#22: 
Here are some Warning got when compiling Linux 2.6.65 (devfs not configured)

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#43: FILE: devfs_fs_kernel.h:101:
+#define devfs_remove(x, ...) do { ; } while (0) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#43: FILE: devfs_fs_kernel.h:101:
+#define devfs_remove(x, ...) do { ; } while (0) 

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
