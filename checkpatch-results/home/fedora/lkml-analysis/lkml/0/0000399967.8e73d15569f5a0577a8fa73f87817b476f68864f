WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#38: FILE: sound/oss/ad1848.c:3010:
+			hw_config->io_base 	= ad1848_dev->io_resource[ad1848_isapnp_list[slot].mss_io].start;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
