WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns

+		err("This USB2.0 device cannot be run on a USB1.1 port. (it lacks a hardware PID filter)");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#66: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/dvb-usb-init.c:60:
+		info("will use the device's hardware PID filter (table count: %d).",d->props.pid_filter_count);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
