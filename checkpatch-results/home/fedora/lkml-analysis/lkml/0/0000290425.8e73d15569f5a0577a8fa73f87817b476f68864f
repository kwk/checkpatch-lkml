CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/kgdb.h:113:
+extern int init_kgdboe(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#184: FILE: kernel/kgdb.c:1106:
+	for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'initalization' may be misspelled - perhaps 'initialization'?
#197: FILE: kernel/kgdb.c:1114:
+	/* Let the arch do any initalization it needs do. */
 	                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_crit([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_crit(dev, ... then pr_crit(...  to printk(KERN_CRIT ...
#253: FILE: kernel/kgdb.c:1150:
+			printk(KERN_CRIT "KGDB cannot initialize, cannot "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#254: FILE: kernel/kgdb.c:1151:
+			printk(KERN_CRIT "KGDB cannot initialize, cannot "
+					"performa breakpoint.\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'breakpoint', this function's name, in a string
#254: FILE: kernel/kgdb.c:1151:
+					"performa breakpoint.\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#256: FILE: kernel/kgdb.c:1153:
+			return;
+		} else

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#256: FILE: kernel/kgdb.c:1153:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
