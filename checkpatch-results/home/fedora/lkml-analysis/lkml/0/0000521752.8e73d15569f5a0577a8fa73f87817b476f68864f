CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements

+"		"LOCK "addl	$" RW_LOCK_BIAS_STR ",(%eax)\n"

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#243: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c:253:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
