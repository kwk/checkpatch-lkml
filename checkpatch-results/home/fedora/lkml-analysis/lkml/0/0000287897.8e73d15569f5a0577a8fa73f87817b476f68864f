#32: 
Did you mean __devinit should be __devexit for cm_remove? Indeed, when I first change it, this question rose. There are still many other driver in kernel 2.4.25 use the same way. But I checked the driver in kernel 2.6 tree use the __devexit already for correct semantic meaning. I made following change, thanks for your correction.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devexit is unnecessary

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

ERROR:DATE_TIME: Use of the '__TIME__' macro makes the build non-deterministic

It is generally desirable that building the same source code with
the same set of tools is reproducible, i.e. the output is always
exactly the same.

The kernel does *not* use the ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros,
and enables warnings if they are used as they can lead to
non-deterministic builds.
