WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#49: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:945:
+#define HW_RAW(dev) (((dev)->id.bustype == BUS_I8042) && ((dev)->id.vendor == 0x0001) && ((dev)->id.product == 0x0001))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'dev' - possible side-effects?

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#71: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:1030:
+	struct vc_data *vc = vc_cons[fg_console].d;
+	kbd = kbd_table + fg_console;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'kbd->kbdmode == VC_RAW'
#85: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:1069:
+	if ((raw_mode = (kbd->kbdmode == VC_RAW)) && !hw_raw)

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#85: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:1069:
+	if ((raw_mode = (kbd->kbdmode == VC_RAW)) && !hw_raw)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
