Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#109: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:829:
+		else if (!memcmp(from, "noapic", 6)) {
+			skip_ioapic_setup =3D 1;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
