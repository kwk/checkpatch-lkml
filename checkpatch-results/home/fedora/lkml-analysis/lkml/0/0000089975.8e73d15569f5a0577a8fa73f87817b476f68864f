CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/migrate.h:15:
+extern int migrate_pages_to(struct list_head *pagelist,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#68: FILE: include/linux/migrate.h:16:
+extern int migrate_pages_to(struct list_head *pagelist,
 			struct vm_area_struct *vma, int dest);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#75: FILE: include/linux/migrate.h:29:
+static int migrate_pages_to(struct list_head *pagelist,
+			struct vm_area_struct *vma, int dest) { return 0; }

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
