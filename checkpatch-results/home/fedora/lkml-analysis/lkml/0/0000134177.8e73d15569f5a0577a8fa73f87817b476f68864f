ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#115: FILE: fs/reiser4/plugin/file/cryptcompress.c:301:
+static void load_crypto_stat(crypto_stat_t * info)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "clust->pages"
#154: FILE: fs/reiser4/plugin/file/cryptcompress.c:2190:
+			assert("edward-1419", clust->pages != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pg"

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
