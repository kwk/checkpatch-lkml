CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!inode"
#75: FILE: fs/ext2/super.c:274:
+	if (inode == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#78: FILE: fs/ext2/super.c:277:
+	if (is_bad_inode(inode)
+	    || (generation && inode->i_generation != generation)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#81: FILE: fs/ext2/super.c:280:
+		iput(inode);
 		^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
