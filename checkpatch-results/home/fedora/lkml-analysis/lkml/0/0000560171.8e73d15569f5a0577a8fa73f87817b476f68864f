WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#40: 
miscompilations, but they're probably more attributable to the immature state

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'include' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#63: FILE: linux/init.h:68:
+	static struct kernel_param __setup_##fn __attribute__((unused)) __initsetup = { __setup_str_##fn, fn }

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
