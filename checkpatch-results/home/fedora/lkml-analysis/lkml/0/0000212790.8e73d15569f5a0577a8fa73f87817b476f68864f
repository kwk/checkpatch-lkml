WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#119: FILE: drivers/infiniband/core/user_mad.c:563:
+static struct file_operations umad_sm_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#242: FILE: drivers/infiniband/core/user_mad.c:691:
+	snprintf(port->sm_class_dev.class_id, BUS_ID_SIZE, "issm%d", port->sm_devnum - IB_UMAD_MAX_PORTS);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
