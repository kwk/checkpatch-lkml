CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#54: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:667:
+extern void sched_idle_next(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#202: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3377:
+	BUG_ON(cpu_online(cpu));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#209: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3384:
+	__setscheduler(p, SCHED_FIFO, MAX_RT_PRIO-1);
 	                                         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#244: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3444:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
