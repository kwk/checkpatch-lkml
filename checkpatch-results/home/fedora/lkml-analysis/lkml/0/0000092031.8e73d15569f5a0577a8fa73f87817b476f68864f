The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#112: FILE: include/asm-i386/mach-xen/mach_cpu.h:2:
+extern void machine_specific_modify_cpu_capabilities(struct cpuinfo_x86 *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct cpuinfo_x86 *' should also have an identifier name
#112: FILE: include/asm-i386/mach-xen/mach_cpu.h:2:
+extern void machine_specific_modify_cpu_capabilities(struct cpuinfo_x86 *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
