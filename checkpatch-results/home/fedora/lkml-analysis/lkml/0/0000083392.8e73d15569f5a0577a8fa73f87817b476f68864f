CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#63: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:331:
+	priv->tail_vma = tail_vma = get_gate_vma(priv->task);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '?' (ctx:VxW)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "tail_vma"
#80: FILE: fs/proc/task_mmu.c:360:
+	m->version = (tail_vma != NULL)? 0: -1UL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
