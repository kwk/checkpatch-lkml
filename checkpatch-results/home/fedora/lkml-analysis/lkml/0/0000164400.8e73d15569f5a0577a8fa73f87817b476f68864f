CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/elf.h> instead of <asm/elf.h>
#42: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/elf_aux.c:12:
+#include <asm/elf.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#55: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/elf_aux.c:46:
+^I^I^I^Iif (vsyscall_ehdr < (unsigned long) envp) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#55: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/elf_aux.c:46:
+				if (vsyscall_ehdr < (unsigned long) envp) 

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
