CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ioc->cic_root.rb_node"
#53: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:3547:
+	if (ioc->cic_root.rb_node != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#55: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:3549:
+		struct rb_node *n = rb_first(&ioc->cic_root);
+		cic = rb_entry(n, struct cfq_io_context, rb_node);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
