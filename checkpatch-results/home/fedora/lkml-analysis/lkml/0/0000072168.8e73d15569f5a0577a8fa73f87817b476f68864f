Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#85: FILE: drivers/acpi/dock.c:237:
+static struct acpi_device * dock_create_acpi_device(acpi_handle handle)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
