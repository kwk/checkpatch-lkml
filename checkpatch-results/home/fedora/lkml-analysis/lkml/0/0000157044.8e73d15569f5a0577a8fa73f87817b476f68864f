CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'buf->offset == subbuf_size'
#134: FILE: fs/relayfs/inode.c:316:
+		if ((read_subbuf == buf->subbufs_produced % n_subbufs) &&
+		    (buf->offset == subbuf_size))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'produced > n_subbufs'

+		if ((produced > n_subbufs) &&
+		    (produced + n_subbufs - consumed <= n_subbufs))

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#217: FILE: fs/relayfs/inode.c:379:
+	if (read_subbuf == write_subbuf) {
[...]
 	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#356: FILE: fs/relayfs/inode.c:468:
+	ret = count = min(count, avail);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
