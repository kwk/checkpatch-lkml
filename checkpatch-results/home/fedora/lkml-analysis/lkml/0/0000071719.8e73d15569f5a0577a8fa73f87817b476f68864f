CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#158: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c:589:
 	static unsigned char generic_sense[6] =
+		{REQUEST_SENSE, 0, 0, 0, 252, 0};

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#268: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c:729:
+		/*FALLTHRU*/

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SCpnt>
#618: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:480:
+	SCpnt->request_bufflen = this_count * sdp->sector_size;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

spaces are never used for indentation.
