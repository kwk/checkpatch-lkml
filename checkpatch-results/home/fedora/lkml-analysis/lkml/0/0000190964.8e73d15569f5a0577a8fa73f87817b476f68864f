+ 	The iSCSI Driver provides a host with the ability to access storage
+	through an IP network. The driver uses the iSCSI protocol to transport
+	SCSI requests and responses over a TCP/IP network between the host
+	(the "initiator") and "targets".  Architecturally, the iSCSI driver
+	combines with the host's TCP/IP stack, network drivers, and Network
+	Interface Card (NIC) to provide the same functions as a SCSI or a
+	Fibre Channel (FC) adapter driver with a Host Bus Adapter (HBA).
+
+	To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	module will be called iscsi_tcp.
+ 
+ 	The userspace component needed to initialize the driver, documentation,
+	and sample configuration files can be found here:
