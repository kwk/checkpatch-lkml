CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#172: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/interrupt.h:57:
+extern u8 iic_get_target_id(int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
