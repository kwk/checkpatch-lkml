CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bmPart>
#45: FILE: fs/qnx4/bitmap.c:31:
+static void count_bits(register const char *bmPart, register int size,

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#86: FILE: fs/qnx4/inode.c:215:
+static int qnx4_get_block( struct inode *inode, sector_t iblock, struct buffer_head *bh, int create )

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct address_space_operations should normally be const
#95: FILE: fs/qnx4/inode.c:450:
+static struct address_space_operations qnx4_aops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
