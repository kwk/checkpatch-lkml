WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#162: FILE: net/Kconfig:61:
+config UNIX
+	tristate "Unix domain sockets"
+	---help---
+	  If you say Y here, you will include support for Unix domain sockets;
+	  sockets are the standard Unix mechanism for establishing and
+	  accessing network connections.  Many commonly used programs such as
+	  the X Window system and syslog use these sockets even if your
+	  machine is not connected to any network.  Unless you are working on
+	  an embedded system or something similar, you therefore definitely
+	  want to say Y here.
+
+	  However, the socket support is also available as a module ( = code
+	  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
+	  whenever you want).  If you want to compile it as a module, say M
+	  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be
+	  called unix.  If you try building this as a module and you have
+	  said Y to "Kernel module loader support" above, be sure to add
+	  'alias net-pf-1 unix' to your /etc/modules.conf file. Note that
+	  several important services won't work correctly if you say M here
+	  and then neglect to load the module.
+
+	  Say Y unless you know what you are doing.
+
+config NET_KEY
+	tristate "PF_KEY sockets"
+	---help---
+	  PF_KEYv2 socket family, compatible to KAME ones.
+	  They are required if you are going to use IPsec tools ported
+	  from KAME.
+
+	  Say Y unless you know what you are doing.
 
 config NETFILTER
 	bool "Network packet filtering (replaces ipchains)"

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
