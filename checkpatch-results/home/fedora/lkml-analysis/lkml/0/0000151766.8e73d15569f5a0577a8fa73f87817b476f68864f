WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#175: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:866:
+		if (result == 0 || cmd == NULL ) {
 			return;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cmd"
#175: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:866:
+		if (result == 0 || cmd == NULL ) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#383: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1441:

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#384: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1442:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#481: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c:1313:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
