WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#26: 
# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#48: 
--- a/fs/proc/proc_misc.c	Fri Dec 27 15:08:53 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#55: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:301:
+extern struct seq_operations ksyms_op;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#55: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:301:
+extern struct seq_operations ksyms_op;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

+static struct file_operations proc_ksyms_operations = {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#116: FILE: kernel/module.c:1436:

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

#119: FILE: kernel/module.c:1439:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
