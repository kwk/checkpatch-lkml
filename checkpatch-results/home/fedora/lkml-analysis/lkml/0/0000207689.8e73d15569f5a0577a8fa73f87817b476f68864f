WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#54: FILE: drivers/usb/hid-core.c:1077:
+		if (hid_submit_out(hid)) {
+			clear_bit(HID_OUT_RUNNING, &hid->iofl);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns
#118: FILE: drivers/usb/hid.h:327:
+	unsigned long iofl;						/* I/O flags (CTRL_RUNNING, OUT_RUNNING) */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
