ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#74: 
--- a/drivers/scsi/ahci.c	2005-03-29 15:45:18 -05:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#135: FILE: drivers/scsi/sata_sil.c:214:
+	u8 cache_line = 0;
+	pci_read_config_byte(pdev, PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, &cache_line);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#164: FILE: drivers/scsi/sata_sil.c:434:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
