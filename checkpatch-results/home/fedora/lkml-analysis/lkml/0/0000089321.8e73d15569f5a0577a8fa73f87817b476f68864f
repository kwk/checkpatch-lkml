CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#83: FILE: include/asm-ia64/bitops.h:37:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#86: FILE: include/asm-ia64/bitops.h:40:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
