CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#60: FILE: sound/oss/sequencer.c:1676:
+	queue = iqueue = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
