Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#131: FILE: include/linux/mmzone.h:287:
+extern void init_per_zone_pages_min(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPECAST_INT_CONSTANT: Unnecessary typecast of c90 int constant - '(unsigned long)1' could be '1UL'
#176: FILE: mm/swap.c:393:
+	while (x & ~(unsigned long)1) {

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#184: FILE: mm/swap.c:401:
+	return (out ? out : 1);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
