CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#133: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:1549:
+static struct request *get_request(request_queue_t *q, int rw,
+					int gfp_mask, int *qfull)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#148: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:1577:
+		if (qfull == NULL) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!qfull"
#148: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:1577:
+		if (qfull == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#151: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:1580:
+		} else

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!freereq"
#217: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:2108:
