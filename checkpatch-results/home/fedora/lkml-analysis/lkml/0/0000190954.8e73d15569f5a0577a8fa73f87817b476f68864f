ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#127: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:171:
+	if ((error = device_suspend(PMSG_FREEZE)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#297: FILE: kernel/power/smp.c:41:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
