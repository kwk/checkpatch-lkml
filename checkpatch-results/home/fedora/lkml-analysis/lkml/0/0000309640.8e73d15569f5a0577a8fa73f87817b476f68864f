#29: 
when working on supporting the 2.6 kernel's acpi support, I ran into some issues on a Dell Inspiron 4100 notebook (w/ Intel Corp. 82830 830 Chipset Host Bridge) when resuming from standby. the basic problem was that agp configuration was lost in the host bridge's pci config space, causing dma problems with our chip.
