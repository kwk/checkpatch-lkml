CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rq"
#115: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:347:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#175: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:637:
+		if (++q->rq[rw].count >= q->batch_requests &&
 				waitqueue_active(&q->wait_for_requests[rw]))
