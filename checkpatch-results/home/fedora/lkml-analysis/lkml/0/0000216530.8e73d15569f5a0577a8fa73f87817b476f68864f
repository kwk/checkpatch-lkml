WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 124 exceeds 100 columns
#38: FILE: drivers/pnp/driver.c:97:
+	pnp_dbg("match found with the PnP device '%s' (%s) and the driver '%s'", dev->bus_id, pnp_dev->name, pnp_drv->name);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!regionid"
#59: FILE: drivers/pnp/system.c:31:
+	if (regionid == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!res"
