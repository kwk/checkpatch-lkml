I have sended this twice... it only changes "AMD Viper support" to show also 

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#31: 
--- a/drivers/ide/Config.in	Thu Apr 24 11:23:57 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
