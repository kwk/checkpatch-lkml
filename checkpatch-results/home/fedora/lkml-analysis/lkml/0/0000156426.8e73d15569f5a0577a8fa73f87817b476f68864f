WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#40: FILE: drivers/net/kgdboe.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#41: FILE: drivers/net/kgdboe.c:2:
+ * drivers/net/kgdboe.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#48: FILE: drivers/net/kgdboe.c:9:
+ * ^I^ITom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>$

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#82: FILE: drivers/net/kgdboe.c:43:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#99: FILE: drivers/net/kgdboe.c:60:
+int init_kgdboe(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#115: FILE: drivers/net/kgdboe.c:76:
+MODULE_PARM_DESC(kgdboe, " kgdboe=[src-port]@[src-ip]/[dev],"
+		 "[tgt-port]@<tgt-ip>/<tgt-macaddr>\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct kgdb_io should normally be const
#117: FILE: drivers/net/kgdboe.c:78:
+static struct kgdb_io local_kgdb_io_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:NETWORKING_BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: networking block comments don't use an empty /* line, use /* Comment...

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#188: FILE: drivers/net/kgdboe.c:149:
+			in_head = in_tail = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
