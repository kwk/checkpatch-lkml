WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+	 * more than that, probably because of clock rate inaccuracies. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#56: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/transport.c:998:
+		udelay(110);

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.
