WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#125: FILE: kernel/acct.c:179:
+	BUG_ON(locked && name);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#161: FILE: kernel/acct.c:245:
+	return (acct_common(name, 0));

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#171: FILE: kernel/acct.c:251:
+	if (acct_file && acct_file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_sb == sb) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#172: FILE: kernel/acct.c:252:
+		(void) acct_common(NULL, 1);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
