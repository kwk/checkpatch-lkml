#476: FILE: drivers/serial/crisv10.c:2859:
+static struct e100_serial* handle_ser_rx_interrupt(struct e100_serial *info)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
