Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#246: FILE: sidtab.h:15:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#248: FILE: sidtab.h:17:
+	struct context* context;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#252: FILE: sidtab.h:21:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
