CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#65: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:310:
+		hwif->irq = hwif->hw.irq =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
