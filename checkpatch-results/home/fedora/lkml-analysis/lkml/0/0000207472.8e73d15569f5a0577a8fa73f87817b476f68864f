WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#46: FILE: arch/ppc/platforms/85xx/mpc85xx_cds_common.c:284:
+extern int mpc85xx_pci1_last_busno;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#58: FILE: arch/ppc/platforms/85xx/mpc85xx_cds_common.c:292:
+^Iif (mpc85xx_pci1_last_busno) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#71: FILE: arch/ppc/syslib/ppc85xx_setup.c:246:
+int mpc85xx_pci1_last_busno = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
