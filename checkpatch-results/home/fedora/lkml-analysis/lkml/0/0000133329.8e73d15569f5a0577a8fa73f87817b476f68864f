CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/percpu.h:36:
+extern void *__alloc_percpu(size_t size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#66: FILE: include/linux/percpu.h:58:
+#define alloc_percpu(type)	((type *)(__alloc_percpu(sizeof(type))))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
