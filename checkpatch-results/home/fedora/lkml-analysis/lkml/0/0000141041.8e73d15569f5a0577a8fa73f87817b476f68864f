Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
