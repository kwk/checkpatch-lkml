specified by the community.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#94: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/iforce/iforce-serio.c:133:
+	if (!(iforce = kmalloc(sizeof(struct iforce), GFP_KERNEL)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*iforce)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct iforce)...)
#94: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/iforce/iforce-serio.c:133:
+	if (!(iforce = kmalloc(sizeof(struct iforce), GFP_KERNEL)))

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#357: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/twidjoy.c:263:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#1059: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serport.c:167:
+		if (get_user(type, (unsigned long __user *) arg))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
