WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'initialize_cache_info', this function's name, in a string
#125: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/setup.c:466:
+	DBG(" -> initialize_cache_info()\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
