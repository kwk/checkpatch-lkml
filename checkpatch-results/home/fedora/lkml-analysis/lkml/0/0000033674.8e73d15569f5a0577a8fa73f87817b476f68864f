ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *			bar" should be "foo *bar"
#103: FILE: include/linux/nfsd/export.h:54:
+	char *			ex_path;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
