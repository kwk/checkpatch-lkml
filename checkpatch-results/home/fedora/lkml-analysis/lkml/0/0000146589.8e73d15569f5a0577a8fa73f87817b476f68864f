--- linux-2.6.14-rc3.orig/arch/x86_64/kernel/suspend.c	2005-10-01 10:37:53.000000000 +0200

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#130: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/suspend.h:10:
+extern int arch_prepare_suspend(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Dprintk>
#182: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:329:
+	Dprintk("init_memory_mapping\n");

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'init_memory_mapping', this function's name, in a string
#182: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:329:
+	Dprintk("init_memory_mapping\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'upto' may be misspelled - perhaps 'up to'?
#225: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:372:
+	early_printk("kernel direct mapping tables upto %lx @ %lx-%lx\n", end,
 	                                           ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#226: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:373:
+	early_printk("kernel direct mapping tables upto %lx @ %lx-%lx\n", end,
+	       table_start<<PAGE_SHIFT,

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#226: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:373:
+	       table_start<<PAGE_SHIFT,
 	                  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
