CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'current->mm'
#81: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/kprobes.c:166:
+	if (segment_from_ldt(regs->xcs) && (current->mm)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#82: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/kprobes.c:167:
+		lp = (unsigned long *) ((unsigned long)(segment_index(regs->xcs) * 8)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#119: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:118:
+^Iif (segment_from_ldt(seg)) { $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#119: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:118:
+	if (segment_from_ldt(seg)) { 
[...]
 	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
