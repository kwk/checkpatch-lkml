ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#42: FILE: drivers/video/console/softcursor.c:27:
+	static u8 *src=NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "src"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
