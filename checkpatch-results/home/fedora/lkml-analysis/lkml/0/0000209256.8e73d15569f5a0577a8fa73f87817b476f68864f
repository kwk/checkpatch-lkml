WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'endianess' may be misspelled - perhaps 'endianness'?
#59: 
 - Are you sure, you got the endianess right? 
                             ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#119: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:159:
+static int ic_dev_mtu __initdata = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#129: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:333:
+		if ((err = dev_set_mtu(ic_dev, ic_dev_mtu)) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#130: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:334:
+^I^I^Iprintk(KERN_ERR "IP-Config: Unable to set interface mtu to %d (%d).\n", $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#130: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:334:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "IP-Config: Unable to set interface mtu to %d (%d).\n", 

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#131: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:335:
+			printk(KERN_ERR "IP-Config: Unable to set interface mtu to %d (%d).\n", 
+				ic_dev_mtu, err);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#150: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:830:
+			ic_dev_mtu = ntohs(*(u16 *)(ext+1));
 			                               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
