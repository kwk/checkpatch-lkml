On some platforms (e.g. SGI Challenge, Origin, and Altix machines), writes to 

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#225: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/iomv.c:74:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(__sn_mmiowb);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#421: FILE: include/asm-ia64/sn/io.h:15:
+extern void __sn_mmiowb(void); /* Forward definition */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:COMPLEX_MACRO: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
#506: FILE: include/asm-mips/io.h:295:
