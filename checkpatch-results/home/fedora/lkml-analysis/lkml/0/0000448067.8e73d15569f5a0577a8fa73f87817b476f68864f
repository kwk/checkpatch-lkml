The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#40: FILE: include/linux/trdevice.h:36:
+extern void		tr_source_route(struct sk_buff *skb, 

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
