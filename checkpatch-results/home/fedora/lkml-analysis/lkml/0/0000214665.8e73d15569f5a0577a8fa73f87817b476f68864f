CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <dotsOK>
#64: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs.h:206:
+		 dotsOK:1,        /* set = hidden and system files are named '.filename' */

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#74: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs.h:216:
+#define FAT_HASH_SIZE	(1UL << FAT_HASH_BITS)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#75: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs.h:217:
+#define FAT_HASH_MASK	(FAT_HASH_SIZE-1)
                      	              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
