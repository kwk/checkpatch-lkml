ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#39: 
--- a/drivers/pci/bus.c	Thu Jan 29 17:24:36 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#46: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:120:
+			sysfs_create_link(&dev->subordinate->class_dev.kobj, &dev->dev.kobj, "bridge");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#70: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:34:
+	struct pci_bus *pci_bus = to_pci_bus(class_dev);
+	if (pci_bus->bridge)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#95: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:59:
+static CLASS_DEVICE_ATTR(cpuaffinity, S_IRUGO, pci_bus_show_cpuaffinity, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#152: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:299:
+	child->number = child->secondary = busnr;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#158: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:305:
+		child->resource[i] = &bridge->resource[PCI_BRIDGE_RESOURCES+i];
 		                                                           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
