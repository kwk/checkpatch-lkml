Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
