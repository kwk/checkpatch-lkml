WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#51: FILE: drivers/parisc/led.c:491:
+	if (unlikely(oops_in_progress)) {
 		currentleds = (count_HZ<=(HZ/2)) ? 0 : 0xff;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
