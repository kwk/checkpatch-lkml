Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#61: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:112:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#91: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:184:
+		*--isp = (u32) current_stack_pointer();

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#104: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:193:
+		stack = (unsigned long*)irq_previous_esp(context);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
