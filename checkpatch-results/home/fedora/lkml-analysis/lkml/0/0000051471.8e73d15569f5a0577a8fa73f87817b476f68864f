CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:220:
+extern void clocksource_adjust(struct clocksource *, s64);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct clocksource *' should also have an identifier name
#48: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:220:
+extern void clocksource_adjust(struct clocksource *, s64);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 's64' should also have an identifier name
#48: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:220:
+extern void clocksource_adjust(struct clocksource *, s64);

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'adusted' may be misspelled - perhaps 'adjusted'?
#78: FILE: kernel/time/clocksource.c:78:
+	 * here.  This is tuned so that an error of about 1 msec is adusted
 	                                                            ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#123: FILE: kernel/time/clocksource.c:123:
+	if (error > interval) {
[...]
+	} else if (error < -interval) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
