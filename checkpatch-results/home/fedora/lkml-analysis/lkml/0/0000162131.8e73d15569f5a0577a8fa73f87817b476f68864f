#60: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_core.c:23:
  * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
