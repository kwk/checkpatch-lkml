#27: 
This patch extends the call_usermodehelper api by adding a callback variant.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#148: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:271:
+	BUG_ON(!cb || !cbdata);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#164: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:284:
+	struct simple_usermodehelper_info *info = cbdata;
+	return execve(info->path, info->argv, info->envp);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#189: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:309:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#207: FILE: include/linux/kmod.h:38:
+extern int call_usermodehelper_cb(call_usermodehelper_cb_t cb, void *cbdata, int wait);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
