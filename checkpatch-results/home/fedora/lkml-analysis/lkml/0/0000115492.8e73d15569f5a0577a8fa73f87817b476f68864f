WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#632: FILE: fs/jffs2/gc.c:316:
+		   drop the alloc_mutex before sleeping. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'jffs2_reserve_space', this function's name, in a string
#710: FILE: fs/jffs2/nodemgmt.c:56:
+	D1(printk(KERN_DEBUG "jffs2_reserve_space(): alloc mutex got\n"));

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
