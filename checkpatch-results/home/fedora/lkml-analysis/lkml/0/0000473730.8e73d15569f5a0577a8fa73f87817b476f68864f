#17: 
One of the largest places for BKL contention in 2.4 is ext2_get_block().  On my 2-way, dbench causes around 4% of combined CPU time just spinning on the lock_kernel() in ext2_get_block().  On bigger machines it just gets worse.  Say what you will about dbench, I know it isn't the most real-world benchmark, but it does provide a quick and dirty method for producing a nasty amount of disk load.
