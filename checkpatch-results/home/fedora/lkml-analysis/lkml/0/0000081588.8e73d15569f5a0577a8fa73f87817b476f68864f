CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#221: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:172:
+extern fastcall irqreturn_t handle_IRQ_event(unsigned int irq, struct pt_regs *regs,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#222: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:173:
+extern fastcall irqreturn_t handle_IRQ_event(unsigned int irq, struct pt_regs *regs,
 					struct irqaction *action);
