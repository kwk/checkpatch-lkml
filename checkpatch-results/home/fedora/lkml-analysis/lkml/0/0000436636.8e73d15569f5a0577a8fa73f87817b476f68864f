WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#39: FILE: net/ipv6/anycast.c:1:
+/* $Header$ */

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#43: FILE: net/ipv6/anycast.c:5:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated
#48: FILE: net/ipv6/anycast.c:10:
+ *	$Id$

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

Umm, in the kernel tree $Header$ and $Id$ will never be filled out.

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.
