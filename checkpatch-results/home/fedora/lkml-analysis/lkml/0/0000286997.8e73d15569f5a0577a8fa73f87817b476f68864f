CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#125: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1425:
+	if (!cpu_isset(dest_cpu, p->cpus_allowed) ||
+			unlikely(cpu_is_offline(dest_cpu)))

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#204: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3675:
+		list_for_each_entry_safe(req, tmp, head, list) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#205: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3676:
+			BUG_ON(req->type != REQ_MOVE_TASK);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
