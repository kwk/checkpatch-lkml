#14: 
Subject: [PATCH] [rmap] operator-sparse Fibonacci hashing of waitqueues

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#77: 
--- a/include/linux/mm_inline.h	Sun Feb 17 00:49:26 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
