Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#54: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2829:
+static void update_inode_times(struct inode *inode) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#57: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2832:
+	time_t now = CURRENT_TIME;
+	if (inode->i_ctime != now || inode->i_mtime != now) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 12)
#57: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2832:
+	if (inode->i_ctime != now || inode->i_mtime != now) {
+	    inode->i_ctime = inode->i_mtime = now;

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#58: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2833:
+	    inode->i_ctime = inode->i_mtime = now;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
