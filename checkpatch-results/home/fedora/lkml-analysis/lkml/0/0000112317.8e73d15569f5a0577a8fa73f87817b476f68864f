WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#20: 
Subject: [patch] fix O_DIRECT read of last block in a sparse file

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#80: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:869:
+				 * the last block in the file */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
