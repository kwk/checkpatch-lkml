ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#59: 
--- a/drivers/i2c/chips/w83627hf.c	Wed Apr 14 15:14:33 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#103: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/w83627hf.c:678:
+	data->fan_div[nr] = DIV_TO_REG(simple_strtoul(buf, NULL, 10));

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
