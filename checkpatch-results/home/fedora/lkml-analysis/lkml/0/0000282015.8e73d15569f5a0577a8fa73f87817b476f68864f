WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#35: 
anyone's interested, but they're pretty straightforward, so I'm just posting 

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#78: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:110:
+extern int early_printk_ok;		/* If set, console drivers will be called even if the system isn't up yet */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
