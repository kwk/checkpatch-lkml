Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:ARCH_DEFINES: architecture specific defines should be avoided
#212: FILE: fs/exec.c:267:
+#if defined(__i386__) || defined(__alpha__)

Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever
possible.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#252: FILE: fs/proc/root.c:848:
+		if (!pid) break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#264: FILE: include/asm-alpha/uaccess.h:491:
+ * a value greater than N if the limit would be exceeded, else strlen.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#265: FILE: include/asm-alpha/uaccess.h:492:
+extern long __strnlen_user(const char *, long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
