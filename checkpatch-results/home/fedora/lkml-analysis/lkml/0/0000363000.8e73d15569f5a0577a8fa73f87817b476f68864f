+	depends on MMU
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
+	  executables used across different architectures and operating
+	  systems. Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries
+	  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
+	  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
+	  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able
+	  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems
+	  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new
+	  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely
+	  want to say Y here.
+
+	  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from
+	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.
+
+	  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y
+	  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then
+	  you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including
+	  ld.so (check the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and
+	  latest version).
+
+	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
+	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
+	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
+	  will be called binfmt_elf. Saying M or N here is dangerous because
+	  some crucial programs on your system might be in ELF format.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

+	---help---
+	  A.out (Assembler.OUTput) is a set of formats for libraries and
+	  executables used in the earliest versions of UNIX. Linux used the
+	  a.out formats QMAGIC and ZMAGIC until they were replaced with the
+	  ELF format.
+
+	  The conversion to ELF started in 1995.  This option is primarily
+	  provided for historical interest and for the benefit of those
+	  who need to run binaries from that era.
+
+	  Most people should answer N here.  If you think you may have
+	  occasional use for this format, enable module support above
+	  and answer M here to compile this support as a module called
+	  binfmt_aout.
+
+	  If any crucial components of your system (such as /sbin/init
+	  or /lib/ld.so) are still in a.out format, you will have to
+	  say Y here.

+config BINFMT_MISC
+	tristate "Kernel support for MISC binaries"
+	---help---
+	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary
+	  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use
+	  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python or
+	  Emacs-Lisp. It's also useful if you often run DOS executables under
+	  the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
+	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>). Once you have
+	  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of
+	  those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt; Linux
+	  will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.
+
+	  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file
+	  <file:Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt> to learn how to use this
+	  feature, and <file:Documentation/java.txt> for information about how
+	  to include Java support.
+
+	  You must say Y to "/proc file system support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) to
+	  use this part of the kernel.
+
+	  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when
+	  you have use for it; the module is called binfmt_misc. If you
+	  don't know what to answer at this point, say Y.
