Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#100: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:113:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#107: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:118:
+	/* The formula for the fraction part of the idle time really is
+	   ((t * 100) / HZ) % 100, but that would overflow about

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#170: FILE: kernel/timer.c:692:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#238: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:548:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
