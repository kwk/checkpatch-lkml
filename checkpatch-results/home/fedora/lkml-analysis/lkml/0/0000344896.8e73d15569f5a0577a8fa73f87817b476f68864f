WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#90: FILE: Makefile:264:
+# catch them early, and hand them over to scripts/kconfig/Makefile

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#93: FILE: Makefile:267:
+# For example 'make oldconfig all'. $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
