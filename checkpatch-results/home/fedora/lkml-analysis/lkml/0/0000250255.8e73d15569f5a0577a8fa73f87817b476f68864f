#21: 
ACPI driver uses zero as an error return while parsing _PRT. On ES7000, pin 0 on the first IO-APIC is used for a PCI device. While zero is a legitimate GSI, it gets discarded as invalid by the parser. This results in any device with an interrupt line wired to IRQ 0 will not be assigned an IRQ for that interrupt line. This causes failure of the slot that contains device wired to pin 0. Below is proposed code change to use "-1" as error return:

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dev->irq <= 0xF'
#156: FILE: drivers/acpi/pci_irq.c:372:
+		if (dev->irq >= 0 && (dev->irq <= 0xF)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
