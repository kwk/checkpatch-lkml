WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#982: FILE: kernel/signal.c:2428:
+/* Some platforms have their own version with special arguments others
+   support only sys_rt_sigprocmask.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
