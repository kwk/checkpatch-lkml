#30: 
This patch series creates a strndup_user() function in order to avoid duplicated

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: include/linux/string.h:22:
+extern char *strndup_user(const char __user *, long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#67: FILE: mm/util.c:5:
+#include <asm/uaccess.h>
