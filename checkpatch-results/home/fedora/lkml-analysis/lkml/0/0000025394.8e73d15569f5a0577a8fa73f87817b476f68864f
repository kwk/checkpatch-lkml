ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#53: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:25:
+struct frozen_fs
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#72: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:44:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'sb->s_frozen == SB_FREEZE_TRANS'
#83: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:55:
+		if (!sb->s_root || !sb->s_bdev ||
+		    (sb->s_frozen == SB_FREEZE_TRANS) ||
+		    (sb->s_flags & MS_RDONLY))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*fs)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct frozen_fs)...)
#88: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:60:
+		fs = kmalloc(sizeof(struct frozen_fs), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'dependant' may be misspelled - perhaps 'dependent'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#97: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:69:
+	 * on ext3). */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
