Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#74: FILE: include/net/sctp/sctp.h:192:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
