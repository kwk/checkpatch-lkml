ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#70: FILE: fs/ioprio.c:41:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#93: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1212:
+	int (*task_setioprio) (struct task_struct * p, int ioprio);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
