ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#65: FILE: fs/reiser4/search.new.c:1092:
+static int key_is_ld(znode * node, const reiser4_key * key) {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#65: FILE: fs/reiser4/search.new.c:1092:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "node"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
