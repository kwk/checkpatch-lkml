The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+#   usage: patch-kernel [ sourcedir [ patchdir [ stopversion ] [ -acxx $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#38: FILE: patch-kernel:3:
+#   usage: patch-kernel [ sourcedir [ patchdir [ stopversion ] [ -acxx 

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'PARM' may be misspelled - perhaps 'PARAM'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
