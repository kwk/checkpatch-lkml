WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#70: FILE: drivers/net/via-rhine.c:1665:
+		if (np->tx_thresh < 0xE0) {
+			writeb(np->tx_thresh += 0x20, ioaddr + TxConfig);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <TxConfig>
#71: FILE: drivers/net/via-rhine.c:1666:
+			writeb(np->tx_thresh += 0x20, ioaddr + TxConfig);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
