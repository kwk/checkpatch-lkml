WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'funtions' may be misspelled - perhaps 'functions'?

+ * of these funtions.
             ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:IF_0: Consider removing the code enclosed by this #if 0 and its #endif

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#274: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/irq.c:519:
+	unsigned long *lrptr;
+	if (!(regs->msr & MSR_PR)) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#299: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c:2:
+ * arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#425: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c:20:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'alingment' may be misspelled - perhaps 'alignment'?
#487: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c:55:

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <computeSignal>
#541: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c:68:
+static int computeSignal(unsigned int tt)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#937: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c:148:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'procesing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'processing'?

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct kgdb_arch should normally be const
#1361: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c:290:
+struct kgdb_arch arch_kgdb_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#1413: FILE: arch/ppc/mm/fault.c:146:
+		 * Don't handle it like user accesses */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
