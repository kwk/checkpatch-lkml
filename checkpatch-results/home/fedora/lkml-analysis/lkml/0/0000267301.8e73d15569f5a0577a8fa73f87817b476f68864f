#33: 
- Remove software_resume() from swsusp; rename pm_resume() to software_resume().

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#52: 
--- a/include/linux/suspend.h	2004-07-17 14:50:25 -07:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#69: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:33:
+static int noresume = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#159: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:344:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#165: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:350:
+	strncpy( resume_file, str, 255 );

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#223: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:83:
+extern char resume_file[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
