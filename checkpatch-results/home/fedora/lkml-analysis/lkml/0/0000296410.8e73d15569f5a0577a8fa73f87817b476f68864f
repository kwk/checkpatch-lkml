WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#100: 
#if defined(__sparc__) || (defined(__mc68000__) && defined(CONFIG_MMU))

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#150: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:285:
+		wrote = do_write_mem((void*)p, p, buf, wrote, ppos);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
