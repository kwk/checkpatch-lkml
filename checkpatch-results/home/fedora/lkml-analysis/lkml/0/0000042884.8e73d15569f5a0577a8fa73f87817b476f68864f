CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#53: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:249:
+		return (unsigned long) -EINVAL;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#68: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:264:
+		return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
