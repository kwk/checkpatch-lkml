ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#59: FILE: kernel/sched.c:905:
+/* $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'this_rq->nr_running > prev_cpu_load_cache(this_cpu)'
#75: FILE: kernel/sched.c:943:
+	if (idle || (this_rq->nr_running > prev_cpu_load_cache(this_cpu)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
