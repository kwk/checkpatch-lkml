WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#67: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/process.c:309:
+	extern void ret_from_fork(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#80: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/process.c:328:
+	childstack->r26 = (unsigned long) ret_from_fork;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
