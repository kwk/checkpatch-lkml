[PATCH] class: convert sound/* to use the new class api instead of class_simple

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#51: FILE: sound/core/sound.c:67:
+extern struct class *sound_class;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#123: FILE: sound/oss/soundcard.c:605:
+			class_device_destroy(sound_class, MKDEV(SOUND_MAJOR, dev_list[i].minor + (j*0x10)));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
