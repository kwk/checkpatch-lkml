#27: 
The attached patch permits advance allocation of radix-tree nodes on a per-task

#31: 
Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/linux/radix-tree.h:76:
+extern int radix_tree_preload_task(unsigned int gfp_mask, int nitems);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!node"
#209: FILE: lib/radix-tree.c:147:
+			if (node == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#258: FILE: lib/radix-tree.c:196:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(radix_tree_preload_task);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#274: FILE: lib/radix-tree.c:903:
+		struct radix_tree_node *node = rtp->nodes;
+		rtp->nodes = node->slots[0];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#279: FILE: lib/radix-tree.c:908:
+	BUG_ON(rtp->count != 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
