CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#74: FILE: drivers/base/firmware_class.c:521:
+	ret = _request_firmware(&fw, fw_work->name, fw_work->device,
 		fw_work->hotplug);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#77: FILE: drivers/base/firmware_class.c:522:
+	if (ret < 0)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
