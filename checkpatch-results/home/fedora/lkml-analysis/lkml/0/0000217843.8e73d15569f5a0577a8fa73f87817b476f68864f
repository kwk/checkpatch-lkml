Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#174: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:763:
+extern int nice_to_prio(const int nice);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
