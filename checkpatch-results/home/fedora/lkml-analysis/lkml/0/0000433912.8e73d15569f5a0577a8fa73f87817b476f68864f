ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#64: 
--- a/fs/binfmt_misc.c	Mon Aug 19 11:44:32 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#70: FILE: fs/binfmt_misc.c:38:
+#define MISC_FMT_PRESERVE_ARGV0 (1<<31)
                                   ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#70: FILE: fs/binfmt_misc.c:38:
+#define MISC_FMT_PRESERVE_ARGV0 (1<<31)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#79: FILE: fs/binfmt_misc.c:125:
+	if (!(fmt->flags & MISC_FMT_PRESERVE_ARGV0)) {
+		remove_arg_zero(bprm);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
