The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#82: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_init_chip.c:51:
+module_param_named(cfgports, ipath_cfgports, ushort, S_IRUGO);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
