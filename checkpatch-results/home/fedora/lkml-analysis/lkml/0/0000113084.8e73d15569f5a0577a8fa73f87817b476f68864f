CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp.h:94:
+extern int rpaphp_get_sensor_state(struct slot *slot, int *state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#95: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp_core.c:414:
+		err("%s: slot[%s] is in invalid state\n", __FUNCTION__, slot->name);
