WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#80: FILE: mm/shmem.c:229:
+	entry = shmem_swp_entry (info, page->index);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'allocted' may be misspelled - perhaps 'allocated'?
#81: FILE: mm/shmem.c:230:
+	if (!entry)	/* this had been allocted on page allocation */
 	           	                 ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#82: FILE: mm/shmem.c:231:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
