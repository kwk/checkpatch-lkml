The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#68: FILE: linux/i2c.h:58:
+extern int i2c_transfer(struct i2c_adapter *adap, struct i2c_msg $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: linux/i2c.h:58:
+extern int i2c_transfer(struct i2c_adapter *adap, struct i2c_msg 

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
