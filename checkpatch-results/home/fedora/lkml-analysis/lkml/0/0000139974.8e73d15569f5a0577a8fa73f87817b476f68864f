ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#54: FILE: arch/um/drivers/net_kern.c:108:
+ ^I^Idev_ip_addr(dev, &lp->mac[2]);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#139: FILE: arch/um/include/net_user.h:28:
+extern void dev_ip_addr(void *d, unsigned char *bin_buf);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
