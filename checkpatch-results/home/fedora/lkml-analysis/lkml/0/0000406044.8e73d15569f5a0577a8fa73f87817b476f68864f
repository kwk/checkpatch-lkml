#29: 
# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#54: 
--- a/arch/alpha/kernel/setup.c	Tue Dec 17 16:23:02 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#221: FILE: include/linux/notifier.h:28:
+extern int register_panic_notifier(struct notifier_block *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct notifier_block *' should also have an identifier name
#221: FILE: include/linux/notifier.h:28:
+extern int register_panic_notifier(struct notifier_block *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#222: FILE: include/linux/notifier.h:29:
+extern int unregister_panic_notifier(struct notifier_block *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct notifier_block *' should also have an identifier name
#222: FILE: include/linux/notifier.h:29:
+extern int unregister_panic_notifier(struct notifier_block *);

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#243: FILE: kernel/ksyms.c:526:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(unregister_panic_notifier);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#257: FILE: kernel/panic.c:26:
+int register_panic_notifier(struct notifier_block * nb)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
