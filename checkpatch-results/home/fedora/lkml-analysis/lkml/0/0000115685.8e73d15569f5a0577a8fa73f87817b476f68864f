WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct fuse_conn *' should also have an identifier name
#109: FILE: fs/fuse/inode.c:31:
+	ssize_t (*show)(struct fuse_conn *, char *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#233: FILE: fs/fuse/inode.c:465:
+	unsigned long long val;
+	spin_lock(&fuse_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#332: FILE: fs/fuse/inode.c:588:
+static struct sysfs_ops fuse_conn_sysfs_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
