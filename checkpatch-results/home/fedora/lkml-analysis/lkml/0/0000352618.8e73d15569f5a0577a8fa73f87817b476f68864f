CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#208: FILE: fs/fat/misc.c:101:
+	last = new_fclus = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#271: FILE: fs/fat/misc.c:154:
+		fat_fs_panic(sb, "clusters badly computed (%d != %ld)",
+			new_fclus, inode->i_blocks >> (cluster_bits - 9));
