Yes, I know the code I leave there is still _bogus_, see next patch for this.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#44: FILE: fs/hppfs/hppfs_kern.c:682:
+static void* hppfs_follow_link(struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)
                                                                         ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#44: FILE: fs/hppfs/hppfs_kern.c:682:
+static void* hppfs_follow_link(struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dentry *' should also have an identifier name
#50: FILE: fs/hppfs/hppfs_kern.c:686:
+	void * (*follow_link)(struct dentry *, struct nameidata *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct nameidata *' should also have an identifier name
#50: FILE: fs/hppfs/hppfs_kern.c:686:
+	void * (*follow_link)(struct dentry *, struct nameidata *);

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
