Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct fuse_conn *' should also have an identifier name
#145: FILE: fs/fuse/fuse_i.h:193:
+	void (*end)(struct fuse_conn *, struct fuse_req *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
