The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#265: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx_old.c:2645:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#265: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx_old.c:2645:
 {
+	

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#268: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx_old.c:2648:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

#270: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx_old.c:2650:
