--- 2.4.19-pre2/drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c~blk-queue	Fri Mar  1 19:40:12 2002

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rq"
#110: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:347:
+		if (rq == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#168: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:635:
+		if (++q->rq[rw].count >= q->batch_requests &&
 				waitqueue_active(&q->wait_for_requests[rw]))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#247: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:170:
+extern int blk_grow_request_list(request_queue_t *q, int nr_requests);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
