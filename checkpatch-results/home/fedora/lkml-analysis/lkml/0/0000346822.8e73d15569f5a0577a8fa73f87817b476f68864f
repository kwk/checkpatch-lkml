ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#57: FILE: media/video/videodev.c:370:
+struct proc_dir_entry *video_proc_entry = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#66: FILE: media/video/videodev.c:380:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
