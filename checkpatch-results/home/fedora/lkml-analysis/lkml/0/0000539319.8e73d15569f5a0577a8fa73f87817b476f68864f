ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#65: FILE: lib/string.c:334:
+char * strsep(char **s, const char *ct)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sbegin"
#75: FILE: lib/string.c:338:
+	if (sbegin == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#81: FILE: lib/string.c:341:
+	if (*s = strpbrk(sbegin, ct))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
