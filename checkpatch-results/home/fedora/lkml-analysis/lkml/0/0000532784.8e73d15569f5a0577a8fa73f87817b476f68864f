CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#73: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:260:
+			if (z->free_pages < z->pages_low && z->inactive_clean_pages) {
[...]
+			} else count = 0;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#80: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:267:
+			} else count = 0;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
