WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'gracefuly' may be misspelled - perhaps 'gracefully'?
#133: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:440:
+	 * try to return gracefuly.
 	                 ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#135: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:442:
+	if (timr->it_process == NULL) return 1;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!timr->it_process"
#135: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:442:
+	if (timr->it_process == NULL) return 1;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
