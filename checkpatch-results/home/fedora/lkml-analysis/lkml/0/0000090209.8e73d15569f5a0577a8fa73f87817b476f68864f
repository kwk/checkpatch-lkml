CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'current->rcu_read_lock_cpu == smp_processor_id()'
#132: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:199:
+		if ((atomic_read(current->rcu_flipctr1) == 1) &&
+		    (current->rcu_read_lock_cpu == smp_processor_id())) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#199: FILE: kernel/rcupreempt.c:355:
+	    (atomic_read(&__get_cpu_var(rcu_flipctr)[flipctr]) == 0)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
