CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#127: FILE: include/linux/posix-timers.h:107:
+	if (unlikely(delta.tv64 > t->it.real.incr.tv64)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#131: FILE: include/linux/posix-timers.h:111:
+		dclc = dns = ktime_to_ns(delta);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#215: FILE: include/linux/time.h:76:
+extern void do_posix_clock_monotonic_gettime(struct timespec *ts);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around '!ts'
#601: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:595:

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
