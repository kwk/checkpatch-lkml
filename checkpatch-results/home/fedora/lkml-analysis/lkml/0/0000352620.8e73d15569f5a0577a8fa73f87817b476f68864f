CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#64: FILE: fs/fat/cache.c:341:
+	if (ret < 0)
[...]
+	else if (ret == FAT_ENT_EOF) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
