WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#62: FILE: drivers/input/keybdev.c:133:
+extern int mac_hid_mouse_emulate_buttons(int caller, unsigned int keycode, int down);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#71: FILE: drivers/input/keybdev.c:142:
+	/* There should be an if() here to determine whether emulate_raw() is to be called or not.
+	 If the key is caught, emulate_raw() should not be called. K.Y. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#95: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:140:
+^I^I^I^I        index = mac_hid_mouse_emulate_buttons(2, index, 0);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
