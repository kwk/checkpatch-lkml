WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#101: FILE: kernel/timer.c:512:
+extern int account_timer(unsigned int function,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#102: FILE: kernel/timer.c:513:
+extern int account_timer(unsigned int function,
+			struct timer_top_info *top_info);

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#126: FILE: kernel/timer_top.c:23:
+^Istruct list_head ^Ilist;$

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!top_info_file"
#197: FILE: kernel/timer_top.c:83:
+	if (top_info_file == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
