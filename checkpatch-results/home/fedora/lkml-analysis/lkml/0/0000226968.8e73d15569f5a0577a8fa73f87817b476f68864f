Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#179: FILE: longrun.c:273:
+                power = ((double)mhz * voltage) * voltage;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#179: FILE: longrun.c:273:
+                power = ((double)mhz * voltage) * voltage;$

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#182: FILE: longrun.c:275:
+		printf(_("%6.3f "), ((double) power) / max_power);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#193: FILE: longrun.c:296:
+		if (io_div) {
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#196: FILE: longrun.c:299:
+		}
+		else {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
