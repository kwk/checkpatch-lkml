CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*p)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct proc_mounts)...)
#188: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:684:
+		p = kmalloc(sizeof(struct proc_mounts), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
