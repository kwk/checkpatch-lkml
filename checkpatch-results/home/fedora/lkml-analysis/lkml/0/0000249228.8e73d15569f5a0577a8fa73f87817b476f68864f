ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#44: FILE: drivers/base/class.c:463:
+struct class * class_find(char * name)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: include/linux/device.h:166:
+extern struct class * class_find(char * name);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
