#46: 
This patch refines scheduler statistics collection and display to three levels,

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#198: FILE: kernel/sched.c:410:
+__setup("schedstats", schedstats_setup_enable);

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#209: FILE: kernel/sched.c:421:
+		seq_printf(seq, "runqueue and scheddomain stats are not "
+				"enabled\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#230: FILE: kernel/sched.c:433:
+		if (schedstats_rq_on()) {
[...]
+			seq_printf(seq, "\n");
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
