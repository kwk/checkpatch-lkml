WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#15: 
Subject: mm/ sparse cleanups

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: include/linux/vmalloc.h:57:
+extern long vread(char *buf, char *addr, unsigned long count);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: include/linux/vmalloc.h:58:
+extern long vwrite(char *buf, char *addr, unsigned long count);

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after initkmem_list3[NUM_INIT_LISTS]
#120: FILE: mm/slab.c:305:
+static struct kmem_list3 __initdata initkmem_list3[NUM_INIT_LISTS];

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
