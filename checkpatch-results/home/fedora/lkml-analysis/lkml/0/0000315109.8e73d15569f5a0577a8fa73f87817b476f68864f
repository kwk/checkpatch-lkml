modfications to existing code. The patch I sent (the second one actually) 
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:NEW_TYPEDEFS: do not add new typedefs

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#73: FILE: include/linux/wait.h:26:
+	void *(*dup)(void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

#148: FILE: include/linux/wait.h:125:
+extern void FASTCALL(remove_wait_queue_info(wait_queue_head_t *q, wait_queue_t * wait,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#148: FILE: include/linux/wait.h:125:
+extern void FASTCALL(remove_wait_queue_info(wait_queue_head_t *q, wait_queue_t * wait,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
