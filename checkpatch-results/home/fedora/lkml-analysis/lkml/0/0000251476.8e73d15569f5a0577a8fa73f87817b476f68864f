Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#145: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:352:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'info->fix.type == FB_TYPE_TEXT'
#289: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:981:
+	if (vc->vc_num != display_fg || logo_shown == -3 ||
 	    (info->fix.type == FB_TYPE_TEXT))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#383: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:1305:
+	info->var.xoffset = info->var.yoffset = p->yscroll = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#428: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:2118:
+	    registered_fb[(int) con2fb_map[prev_console]] != info)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#439: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:2154:
 	if (logo_shown == -2) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
