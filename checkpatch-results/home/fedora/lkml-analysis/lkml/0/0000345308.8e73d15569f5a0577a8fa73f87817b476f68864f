WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#117: FILE: i2c/i2c-dev.c:229:
+		tmp_pa = (struct i2c_msg *)
+			kmalloc(rdwr_arg.nmsgs * sizeof(struct i2c_msg), 
+			GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#119: FILE: i2c/i2c-dev.c:231:
+			kmalloc(rdwr_arg.nmsgs * sizeof(struct i2c_msg), 
+			GFP_KERNEL);

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#121: FILE: i2c/i2c-dev.c:233:
+		if (tmp_pa == NULL) return -ENOMEM;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tmp_pa"
#121: FILE: i2c/i2c-dev.c:233:
+		if (tmp_pa == NULL) return -ENOMEM;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
