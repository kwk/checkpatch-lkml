CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#54: FILE: tmp/msdos.c:118:
+	this_sector = first_sector = hd->part[minor].start_sect;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
