#23: 
(perhaps do_gettimeofday() is a good candidate for consolidation across archs?)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#46: FILE: arch/m68k/kernel/time.c:136:
+		if (unlikely(time_adjust < 0)) {
[...]
+		else if (unlikely(lost))
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#52: FILE: arch/m68k/kernel/time.c:142:
+		}
+		else if (unlikely(lost))

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
