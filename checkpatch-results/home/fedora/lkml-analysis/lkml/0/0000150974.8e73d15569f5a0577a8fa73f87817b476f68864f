Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#101: FILE: drivers/input/input.c:30:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(input_allocate_device);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*dev)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct input_dev)...)
#126: FILE: drivers/input/input.c:625:
+	dev = kzalloc(sizeof(struct input_dev), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
