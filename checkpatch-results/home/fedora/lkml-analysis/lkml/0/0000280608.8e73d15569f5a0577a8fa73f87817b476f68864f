WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#45: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:337:
+		extern char swsusp_pg_dir[PAGE_SIZE];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#46: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:338:
+		extern char swsusp_pg_dir[PAGE_SIZE];
+		memcpy(swsusp_pg_dir, swapper_pg_dir, PAGE_SIZE);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
