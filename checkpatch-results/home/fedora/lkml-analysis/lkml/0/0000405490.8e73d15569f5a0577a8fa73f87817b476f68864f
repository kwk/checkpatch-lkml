ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#118: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-pnp.c:77:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
