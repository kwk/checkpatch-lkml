# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#49: 
--- a/drivers/block/blkpg.c	Fri Aug 23 14:17:46 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#66: FILE: drivers/block/blkpg.c:81:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#66: FILE: drivers/block/blkpg.c:81:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct block_device_operations should normally be const
#174: FILE: fs/partitions/check.c:418:
+	struct block_device_operations *ops, sector_t size)

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#226: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:284:
+extern void grok_partitions(kdev_t dev, sector_t size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 130 exceeds 100 columns
#230: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:287:
+extern void register_disk(struct gendisk *dev, kdev_t first, unsigned minors, struct block_device_operations *ops, sector_t size);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
