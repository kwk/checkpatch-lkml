WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#79: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/setup.c:723:
+extern __kernel_size_t __real_memcpy(void *, const void *, __kernel_size_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#79: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/setup.c:723:
+extern __kernel_size_t __real_memcpy(void *, const void *, __kernel_size_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#111: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/setup.c:755:
+struct seq_operations memcpy_lens_op = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
