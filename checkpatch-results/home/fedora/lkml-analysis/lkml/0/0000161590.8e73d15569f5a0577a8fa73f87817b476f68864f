ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#66: FILE: kernel/fork.c:461:
+static int copy_mm(unsigned long clone_flags, struct task_struct * tsk,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#82: FILE: kernel/fork.c:475:
+		tsk->min_flt = tsk->maj_flt = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#83: FILE: kernel/fork.c:476:
+		tsk->nvcsw = tsk->nivcsw = 0;

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#98: FILE: kernel/fork.c:997:
+	if ((retval = copy_mm(clone_flags, p, MAY_SHARE)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#224: FILE: kernel/fork.c:1430:
+		if (retval)
[...]
+		else if (unshare_flags & CLONE_SIGHAND) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
