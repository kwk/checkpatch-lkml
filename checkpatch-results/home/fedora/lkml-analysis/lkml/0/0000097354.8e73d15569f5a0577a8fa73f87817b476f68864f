The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0600'.
#365: FILE: fs/nfs/getroot.c:72:
+		fattr.mode = S_IFDIR | S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR;

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

#385: FILE: fs/nfs/getroot.c:92:

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*server)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct nfs_server)...)
#563: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:245:
+	server = kzalloc(sizeof(struct nfs_server), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#569: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:251:
+	server->client = server->client_sys = server->client_acl = ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
