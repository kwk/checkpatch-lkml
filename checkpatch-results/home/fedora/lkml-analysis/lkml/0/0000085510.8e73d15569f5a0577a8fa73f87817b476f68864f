WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'enconded' may be misspelled - perhaps 'encoded'?

Oh. The page is enconded in the migration pte.
                ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#77: FILE: mm/memory.c:1887:
+		BUG_ON(is_migration_entry(entry));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
