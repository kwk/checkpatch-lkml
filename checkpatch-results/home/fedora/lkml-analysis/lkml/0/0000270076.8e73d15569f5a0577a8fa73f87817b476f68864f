WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'offsetp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'offset'?
#68: FILE: fs/nfsd/vfs.c:1501:
+	*offsetp = vfs_llseek(&file, 0LL, 1);
 	 ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#87: FILE: fs/read_write.c:125:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(vfs_llseek);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#106: FILE: fs/read_write.c:170:
+	offset = vfs_llseek(file, ((loff_t) offset_high << 32) | offset_low,

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#107: FILE: fs/read_write.c:171:
+	offset = vfs_llseek(file, ((loff_t) offset_high << 32) | offset_low,
 			origin);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#116: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:926:
+extern loff_t vfs_llseek(struct file *file, loff_t offset, int origin);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
