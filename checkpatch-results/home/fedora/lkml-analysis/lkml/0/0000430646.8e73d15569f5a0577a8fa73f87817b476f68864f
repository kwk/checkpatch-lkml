ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#59: FILE: tmp/dcache.c:873:
+		struct dentry * dentry;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#60: FILE: tmp/dcache.c:874:
+		struct dentry * dentry;
+		read_barrier_depends();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
