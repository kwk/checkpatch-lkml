`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#58: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:748:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#59: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:749:
+		align = size = 4*1024*1024;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#65: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c:754:
 		
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
