ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#73: 
--- a/include/linux/init.h	Mon Feb  9 02:20:51 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#88: FILE: include/linux/init.h:118:
 		 __attribute__((__section__(".init.setup")))	\
+		= { __setup_str_##unique_id, fn }

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'fn' - possible side-effects?
#93: FILE: include/linux/init.h:123:
+#define __setup(str, fn)					\
+	__setup_param(str, fn, fn)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#111: FILE: init/main.c:156:
+			if (!p->setup_func) {
[...]
+			} else if (p->setup_func(line + n))
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
