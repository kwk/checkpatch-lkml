WARNING:YIELD: Using yield() is generally wrong. See yield() kernel-doc (sched/core.c)
#71: FILE: fs/exec.c:591:
+			yield();

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#96: FILE: fs/exec.c:624:
+		current->parent = current->real_parent = leader->real_parent;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#97: FILE: fs/exec.c:625:
+		leader->parent = leader->real_parent = child_reaper;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#116: FILE: fs/exec.c:642:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
