+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sn_irq_info"
#328: FILE: drivers/pci/msi-altix.c:40:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*sn_irq_info)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct sn_irq_info)...)
#380: FILE: drivers/pci/msi-altix.c:92:
+	sn_irq_info = kzalloc(sizeof(struct sn_irq_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#564: FILE: drivers/pci/msi.h:66:
+extern int msi_register(struct msi_ops *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct msi_ops *' should also have an identifier name
#564: FILE: drivers/pci/msi.h:66:
+extern int msi_register(struct msi_ops *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
