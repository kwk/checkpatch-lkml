ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#51:

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#85: FILE: include/linux/morseops.h:1:
+/* Yes, it's morse code ops indeed. */

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#97: FILE: include/linux/morseops.h:13:
+static inline unsigned char tomorse(char c) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#100: FILE: include/linux/morseops.h:16:
+	if (c >= '"' && c <= '_') {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#121: FILE: include/linux/vt_kern.h:39:
+extern void kd_turn_all_leds(int on_or_off);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

distractions when editing files.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

#211: FILE: kernel/morse.c:47:

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
