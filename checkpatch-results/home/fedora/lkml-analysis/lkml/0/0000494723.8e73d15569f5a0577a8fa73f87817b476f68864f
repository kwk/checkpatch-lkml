WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#42: FILE: video/pm2fb.c:51:
+#if defined(__BIG_ENDIAN) && !defined(__sparc__) && (!defined(CONFIG_PPC) || defined(CONFIG_FB_PM2_CVPPC))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
