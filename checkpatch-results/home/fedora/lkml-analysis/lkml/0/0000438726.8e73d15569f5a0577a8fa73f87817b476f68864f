ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#28: 
--- a/drivers/acorn/char/mouse_ps2.c	2002-08-17 00:30:02.000000000 -0500

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#344: FILE: include/linux/blk.h:85:
+extern void add_timing_entropy(void *src, int datum);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
