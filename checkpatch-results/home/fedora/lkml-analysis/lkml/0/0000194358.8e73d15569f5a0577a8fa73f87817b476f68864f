WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#74: FILE: arch/m32r/kernel/setup.c:56:
+extern int rd_image_start;	/* starting block # of image */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#88: FILE: arch/m32r/kernel/setup.c:283:
