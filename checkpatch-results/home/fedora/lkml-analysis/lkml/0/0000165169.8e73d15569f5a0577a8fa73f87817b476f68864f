#31: 
except that the kernel does not execute the requested syscall; this is useful

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#140: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c:525:
+		if (request == PTRACE_SYSEMU) {
[...]
+		} else if (request == PTRACE_CONT) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#158: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c:562:
+		 * TIF_SYSCALL_EMU.*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#282: FILE: include/asm-i386/thread_info.h:154:
+#define _TIF_SYSCALL_EMU	(1<<TIF_SYSCALL_EMU)
                         	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#282: FILE: include/asm-i386/thread_info.h:154:
+#define _TIF_SYSCALL_EMU	(1<<TIF_SYSCALL_EMU)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
