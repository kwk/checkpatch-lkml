CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/acct.h:126:
+extern void acct_init_pacct(struct pacct_struct *pacct);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - void acct_collect() should probably be void acct_collect(void)
#71: FILE: include/linux/acct.h:127:
+extern void acct_collect();

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern void acct_collect();

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#188: FILE: kernel/acct.c:555:
+		struct vm_area_struct *vma;
+		down_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
