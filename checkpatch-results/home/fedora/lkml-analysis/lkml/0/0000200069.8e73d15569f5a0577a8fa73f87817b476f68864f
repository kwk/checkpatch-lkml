WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'u3_insert_memory', this function's name, in a string
#199: FILE: drivers/char/agp/uninorth-agp.c:188:
+			printk("u3_insert_memory: entry 0x%x occupied (%x)\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

distractions when editing files.

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
