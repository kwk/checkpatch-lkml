WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'verion' may be misspelled - perhaps 'version'?
#63: 
of before start_kernel: The first printk line should be the "Linux verion xy"
                                                                   ^^^^^^

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#183: FILE: include/asm-i386/processor.h:101:
+extern void late_identify_cpu(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
