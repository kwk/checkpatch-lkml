WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated
#239: FILE: sys/dev/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_inline.h:40:
+ * $Id: //depot/aic7xxx/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_inline.h#38 $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#242: FILE: sys/dev/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_inline.h:42:
+ * $FreeBSD: /home/ncvs/src/sys/dev/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_inline.h,v 1.19 2002/08/31 06:46:37 gibbs Exp $

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
