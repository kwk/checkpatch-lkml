+#define IP_RT_ACCT_CPU(i) ((u8*)ip_rt_acct + cpu_logical_map(i) * 256)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#83: FILE: ipv4/route.c:2447:
+	if (length > 0)

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
