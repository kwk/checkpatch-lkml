 - Fix all places where do_div() was being called with a bad divisor argument.

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u64' over 'uint64_t'
#75: FILE: include/asm-generic/div64.h:35:
+extern uint32_t __div64_32(uint64_t *dividend, uint32_t divisor);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: include/asm-generic/div64.h:35:
+extern uint32_t __div64_32(uint64_t *dividend, uint32_t divisor);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#107: FILE: lib/vsprintf.c:130:
+static char * number(char * buf, char * end, unsigned long long num, int base, int size, int precision, int type)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#107: FILE: lib/vsprintf.c:130:
+static char * number(char * buf, char * end, unsigned long long num, int base, int size, int precision, int type)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
