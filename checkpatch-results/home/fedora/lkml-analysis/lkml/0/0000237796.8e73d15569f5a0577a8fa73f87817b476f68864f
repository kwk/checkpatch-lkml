Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

+	  *** CAUTION ***
+	  DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!
+	  
+	  If you are configuring your kernel to run on an unattended or
+	  embedded system, you can enter a default passphrase for your
+	  encrypted filesystems here.
+	  This makes it more difficult (but NOT impossible) to copy data
+	  from your encrypted filesystems.
+	  Since this option also reads data from your MB's nvram, 
+	  YOU SHOULD NEVER CHANGE YOUR CMOS SETTINGS WHEN USING THIS OPTION.
+	  Because CMOS settings are often written into the nvram.
+	  In order for this option to work you should also set CONFIG_NVRAM,
+	  the /dev/nvram driver in character devices.
+	  This will also make the filesystem usable only with the specific
+	  version of the MB with the specific nvram settings on which the
+	  filesystem was created.

+	  Enter your default passphrase for encrypted filesystems here.
+	  The minimum recommended length is 16 characters, the max is 32.
+	  Any characters beyond 32 will be ignored. 
+	  It is also recommended that you use a really garbled passphrase
+	  since it will be visible in the output of 'strings bzImage'.
