CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <RxMaxSize>
#76: FILE: drivers/net/r8169.c:1312:
+	RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, RX_BUF_SIZE);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#93: FILE: drivers/net/r8169.c:1702:
+			BUG_ON(pkt_size > (RX_BUF_SIZE - 4));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
