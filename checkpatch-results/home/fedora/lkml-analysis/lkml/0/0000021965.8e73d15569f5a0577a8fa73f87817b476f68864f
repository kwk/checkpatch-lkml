Subject: [PATCH] get_options to allow a hypenated range for isolcpus
                                        ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#78: FILE: lib/cmdline.c:30:
+	upper_range = simple_strtol((*str), NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#120: FILE: lib/cmdline.c:98:
+			int range_nums;
+			range_nums = get_range((char **)&str, ints + i);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
