CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#62: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1690:
+	utime = stime = cputime_zero;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#64: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1692:
 	switch (who) {
+		case RUSAGE_BOTH:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }
