WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#91: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/unaligned.c:218:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#109: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/unaligned.c:308:
+		orig_asi = asi = decode_asi(insn, regs);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#129: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/unaligned.c:326:
+				unsigned long val_in = *(unsigned long *) addr;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#130: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/unaligned.c:327:
+				unsigned long val_in = *(unsigned long *) addr;
+				switch (size) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
