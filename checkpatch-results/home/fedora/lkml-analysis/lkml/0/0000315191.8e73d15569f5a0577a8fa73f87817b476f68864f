Amiga NCR53c710: Coalesce all Amiga NCR53c710 SCSI host adapter configuration

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+	  Support for various NCR53c710-based SCSI controllers on the Amiga.
+	  Support for various NCR53c710-based SCSI controllers on the Amiga.
+	  Support for various NCR53c710-based SCSI controllers on the Amiga.
+	  This includes:
+	    - the builtin SCSI controller on the Amiga 4000T,
+	    - the Amiga 4091 Zorro III SCSI-2 controller,
+	    - the MacroSystem Development's WarpEngine Amiga SCSI-2 controller
+	      (info at
+	      <http://www.lysator.liu.se/amiga/ar/guide/ar310.guide?FEATURE5>),
+	    - the SCSI controller on the Phase5 Blizzard PowerUP 603e+
+	      accelerator card for the Amiga 1200,
+	    - the SCSI controller on the GVP Turbo 040/060 accelerator.
+	  Note that all of the above SCSI controllers, except for the builtin
+	  SCSI controller on the Amiga 4000T, reside on the Zorro expansion
+	  bus, so you also have to enable Zorro bus support if you want to use
+	  them.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
