- Let Kconfig decide whether to include frontend-specific code in saa7134-dvb.

WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#120: FILE: drivers/media/video/saa7134/saa7134-dvb.c:158:
+	struct i2c_msg tuner_msg = {.addr = 0x60,.flags = 0,.buf = tu1216_init,.len = sizeof(tu1216_init) };

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#233: FILE: drivers/media/video/saa7134/saa7134-dvb.c:258:
+static struct tda1004x_config philips_tu1216_config = {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
