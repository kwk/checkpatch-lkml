# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#55: 
--- a/Makefile	Wed Sep 10 21:15:44 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#82: FILE: Makefile:343:
+	$(Q)$(MAKE) -f $(srctree)/Makefile silentoldconfig

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
