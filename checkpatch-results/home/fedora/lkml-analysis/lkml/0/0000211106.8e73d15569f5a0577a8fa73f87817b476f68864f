#28: 
Current tsc based delay_calibration can result in significant errors in loops_per_jiffy count when the platform events like SMIs (System Management Interrupts that are non-maskable) are present. This could lead to potential kernel panic(). This issue is becoming more visible with 2.6 kernel (as default HZ is 1000) and on platforms with higher SMI handling latencies. During the boot time, SMIs are mostly used by BIOS (for things like legacy keyboard emulation).

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
