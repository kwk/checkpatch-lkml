#30: 
4 processor PIII Xeon running kernbench.  Here is the patch.  Tested on 2.5.70

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#65: FILE: include/linux/mman.h:26:
+static void inline vm_acct_memory(long pages)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
