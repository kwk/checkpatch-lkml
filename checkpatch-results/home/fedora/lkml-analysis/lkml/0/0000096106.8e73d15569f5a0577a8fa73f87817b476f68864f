#27: 
The current swap prefetching implementation is far too aggressive to the point

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#254: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:372:
+		if (ns->last_free) {
[...]
 		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
