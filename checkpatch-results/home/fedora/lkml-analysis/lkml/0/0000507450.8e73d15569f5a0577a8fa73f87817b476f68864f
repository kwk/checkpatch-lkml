CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#118: FILE: fs/partitions/msdos.c:118:
+	this_sector = first_sector = hd->part[minor].start_sect;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#166: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:209:
+	unsigned int bits = 8;
+	do {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
