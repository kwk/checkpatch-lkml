WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#45: FILE: include/linux/latency_hist.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: include/linux/latency_hist.h:25:
+extern void latency_hist(int latency_type, int cpu, unsigned long latency);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
