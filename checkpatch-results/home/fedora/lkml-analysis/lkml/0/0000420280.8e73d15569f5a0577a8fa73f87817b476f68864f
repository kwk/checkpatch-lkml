#54: 
It's my fault. At least the the problem about the disk not spinning down. 

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#79: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:3354:
+static void ide_drive_shutdown(struct device * dev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
