Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated
#59: FILE: include/media/audiochip.h:2:
+ * $Id: audiochip.h,v 1.5 2005/06/16 22:59:16 hhackmann Exp $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#97: FILE: drivers/media/video/msp3400.c:744:
+	if (current->flags & PF_FREEZE) {
+		refrigerator ();
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#98: FILE: drivers/media/video/msp3400.c:745:
+		refrigerator ();

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
