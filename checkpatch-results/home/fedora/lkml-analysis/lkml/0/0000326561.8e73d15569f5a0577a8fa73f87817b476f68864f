ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#112: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:50:
+int vm_swappiness = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#129: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:646:
+	if (unlikely(!i.totalswap))
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
