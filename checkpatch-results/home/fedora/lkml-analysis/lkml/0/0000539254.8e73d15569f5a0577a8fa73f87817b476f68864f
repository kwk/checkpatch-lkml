ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#86: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:402:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#100: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:2721:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

#105: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:2726:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
