WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#218: FILE: drivers/kvm/vmx.c:36:
+extern struct kvm_vmx_segment_field {

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#219: FILE: drivers/kvm/vmx.c:37:

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#220: FILE: drivers/kvm/vmx.c:38:

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#221: FILE: drivers/kvm/vmx.c:39:

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#222: FILE: drivers/kvm/vmx.c:40:

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#264: FILE: drivers/kvm/vmx.c:344:
+	if (var->unusable)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#266: FILE: drivers/kvm/vmx.c:346:
