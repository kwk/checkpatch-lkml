WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#33: FILE: drivers/cdrom/mcdx.c:1043:
+	if (unregister_blkdev(MAJOR_NR, "mcdx") != 0) {
 		xwarn("cleanup() unregister_blkdev() failed\n");
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
