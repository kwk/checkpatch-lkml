WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#66: FILE: fs/devfs/base.c:2190:
+static struct dentry_operations devfs_dops =

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#97: FILE: fs/devfs/base.c:2239:
+    if (lookup_info == NULL) return 1;  /*  Early termination  */

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!lookup_info"
#97: FILE: fs/devfs/base.c:2239:
+    if (lookup_info == NULL) return 1;  /*  Early termination  */

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
