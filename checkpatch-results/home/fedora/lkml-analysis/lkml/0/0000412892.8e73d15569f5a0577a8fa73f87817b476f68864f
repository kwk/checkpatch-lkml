CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SDpnt>
#97: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:284:
+			__blk_run_queue(&SDpnt->request_queue);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#147: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:324:
+extern void __blk_run_queue(request_queue_t *q);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
