ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#38: FILE: efs/super.c:144:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#39: FILE: efs/super.c:145:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
