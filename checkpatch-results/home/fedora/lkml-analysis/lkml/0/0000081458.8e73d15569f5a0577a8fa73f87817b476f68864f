ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#67: FILE: arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c:231:
+^I        tmp = device;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

+extern int sysfs_add_device_to_node(struct sys_device *dev, int nid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
