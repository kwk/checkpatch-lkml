WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#40: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#41: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:2:
+ *	drivers/pci/bus.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#72: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:33:
+pci_bus_alloc_resource(struct pci_bus *bus, struct resource *res,
+	unsigned long size, unsigned long align, unsigned long min,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#75: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:36:
+	void (*alignf)(void *, struct resource *,
+			unsigned long, unsigned long),

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#84: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:45:
+		struct resource *r = bus->resource[i];
+		if (!r)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#92: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:53:
+		/* We cannot allocate a non-prefetching resource
+		   from a pre-fetching area */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
