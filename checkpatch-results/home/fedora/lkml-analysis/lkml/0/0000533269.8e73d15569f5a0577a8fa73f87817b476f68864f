There is a bug in zr36120.c of not freeing memory on error paths.  This one 

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#39: FILE: zr36120.c:1194:
if (vcp==NULL)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#41: FILE: zr36120.c:1194:
if (vw.clipcount &&
copy_from_user(vcp,vw.clips,sizeof(struct video_clip)*vw.clipcount))
+ {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
