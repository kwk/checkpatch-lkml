WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#97: FILE: kernel/signal.c:892:
+	if (t->sighand->action[sig-1].sa.sa_handler == SIG_IGN) {
 		t->sighand->action[sig-1].sa.sa_handler = SIG_DFL;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
