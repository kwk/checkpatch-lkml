ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#184: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serio.c:128:
+	if ((event = kmalloc(sizeof(struct serio_event), GFP_ATOMIC))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*event)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct serio_event)...)
#184: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serio.c:128:
+	if ((event = kmalloc(sizeof(struct serio_event), GFP_ATOMIC))) {

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
