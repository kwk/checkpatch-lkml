WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 128 exceeds 100 columns
#63: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/systbls.S:74:
+	.word sys_ni_syscall, compat_sys_clock_settime, compat_sys_clock_gettime, compat_sys_clock_getres, sys32_clock_nanosleep

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
