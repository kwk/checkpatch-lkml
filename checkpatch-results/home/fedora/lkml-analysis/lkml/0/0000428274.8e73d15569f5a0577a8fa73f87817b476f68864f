WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#37: FILE: include/linux/highmem.h:28:
+#define kunmap_atomic(addr, idx)	do { /* avoid unused variable warnings in caller: */ \
+					     (void)(addr); } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#38: FILE: include/linux/highmem.h:29:
+					     (void)(addr); } while (0)

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
