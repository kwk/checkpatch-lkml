CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!viochar"
#155: FILE: drivers/char/viocons.c:412:
+	if (viochar == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <initDataEvent>
#160: FILE: drivers/char/viocons.c:417:
+	initDataEvent(viochar, pi->lp);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
