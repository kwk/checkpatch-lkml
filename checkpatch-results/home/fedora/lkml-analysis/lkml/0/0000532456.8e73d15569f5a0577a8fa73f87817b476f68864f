ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'info->buffer == NULL'
#41: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:2877:
+        if ((info->buffer == NULL) || (rc = cdrom_fops.open(ip, fp))) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#41: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:2877:
+        if ((info->buffer == NULL) || (rc = cdrom_fops.open(ip, fp))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!info->buffer"
#41: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:2877:
+        if ((info->buffer == NULL) || (rc = cdrom_fops.open(ip, fp))) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
