Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#42: 
It wasn't ready yet, it was still a quick hack. I attached a patch which does 

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#93: FILE: scripts/lxdialog/menubox.c:416:
+            case '/': return 7;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#119: FILE: scripts/kconfig/symbol.c:666:
+	cnt = size = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#326: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:340:

+					}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
