ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#52: FILE: drivers/acpi/tables/tbxfroot.c:297:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#52: FILE: drivers/acpi/tables/tbxfroot.c:297:
+	        if (rsdt_info->pointer) {
+         		acpi_os_unmap_memory (rsdt_info->pointer, (acpi_size) rsdt_info->pointer->length);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#53: FILE: drivers/acpi/tables/tbxfroot.c:298:
+         		acpi_os_unmap_memory (rsdt_info->pointer, (acpi_size) rsdt_info->pointer->length);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
