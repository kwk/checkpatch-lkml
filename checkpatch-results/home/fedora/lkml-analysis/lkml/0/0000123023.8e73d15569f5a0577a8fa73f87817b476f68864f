ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#577: FILE: arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c:280:
+	if ((long)free_mem_ptr < 0x100000) setup_normal_output_buffer();

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*q)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct hash)...)
#984: FILE: init/initramfs.c:44:
+	q = kmalloc(sizeof(struct hash), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
