CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'RID_WEP_TEMP != rid'
#54: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/airo.c:4062:
+		if (test_bit(FLAG_ENABLED, &ai->flags) && (RID_WEP_TEMP != rid))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#54: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/airo.c:4062:
+		if (test_bit(FLAG_ENABLED, &ai->flags) && (RID_WEP_TEMP != rid))

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#63: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/airo.c:5122:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
