CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#102: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/io_apic.c:2093:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#124: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/io_apic.c:2115:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#146: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/hw_irq.h:105:
+extern void setup_ioapic_dest(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:INLINE: plain inline is preferred over __inline
#172: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/smp.h:77:
+static __inline int logical_smp_processor_id(void)

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#175: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/smp.h:80:
+	return GET_APIC_LOGICAL_ID(*(unsigned long *)(APIC_BASE+APIC_LDR));
 	                                                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
