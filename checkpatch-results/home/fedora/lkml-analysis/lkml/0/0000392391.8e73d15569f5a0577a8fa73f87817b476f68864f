WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#27: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c		Version 0.34	Sept 17, 2002

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#62: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1064:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#63: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1065:
+	if(pci_get_drvdata(hwif->pci_dev) == NULL)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#63: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1065:
+	if(pci_get_drvdata(hwif->pci_dev) == NULL)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pci_get_drvdata"
#63: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1065:
+	if(pci_get_drvdata(hwif->pci_dev) == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
