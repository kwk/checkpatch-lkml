ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#161: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:101:
+^I       ^Iif (page_count(page) > (1 + !!page->buffers))$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#161: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:101:
+^I       ^Iif (page_count(page) > (1 + !!page->buffers))$

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#175: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:115:
 	if (mapping->nrpages > atomic_read(&page_cache_size) / 20);
+		return 1;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
