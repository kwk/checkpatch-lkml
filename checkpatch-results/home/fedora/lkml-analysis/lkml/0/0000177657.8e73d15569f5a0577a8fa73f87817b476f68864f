Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
