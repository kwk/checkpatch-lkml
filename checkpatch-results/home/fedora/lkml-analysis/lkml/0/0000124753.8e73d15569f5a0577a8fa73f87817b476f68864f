The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#311: FILE: include/asm-frv/thread_info.h:144:
+#define _TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK	(1 << TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
