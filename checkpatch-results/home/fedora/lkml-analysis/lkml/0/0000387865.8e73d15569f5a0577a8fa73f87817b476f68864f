ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#82: FILE: include/linux/idr.h:28:
+/* Leave the possibility of an incomplete final layer $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#85: FILE: include/linux/idr.h:31:
+ * 32 below
+*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
