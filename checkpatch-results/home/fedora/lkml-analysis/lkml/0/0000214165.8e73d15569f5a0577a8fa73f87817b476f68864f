Fix a kexec problem whcih causes local APIC detection failure.
                    ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#52: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:46:
+int enable_local_apic __initdata = 0; /* -1=force-disable, +1=force-enable */

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#120: FILE: include/asm-i386/apic.h:8:
+#include <asm/processor.h>
