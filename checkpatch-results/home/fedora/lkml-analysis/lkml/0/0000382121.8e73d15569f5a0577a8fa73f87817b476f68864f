CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*driver)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct pcmcia_driver)...)
#48: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/ds.c:197:
+    driver = kmalloc(sizeof(struct pcmcia_driver), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#49: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/ds.c:198:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
