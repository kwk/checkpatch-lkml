CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!regs"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/nmi.h> instead of <asm/nmi.h>
#84: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:23:
+#include <asm/nmi.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#102: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:562:
+static int smp_nmi_callback(struct pt_regs * regs, int cpu)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#257: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:163:
+extern void smp_show_regs(struct pt_regs *, void *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pt_regs *' should also have an identifier name
#257: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:163:
+extern void smp_show_regs(struct pt_regs *, void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
