Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#147: FILE: include/linux/spi/spi.h:378:
+static inline struct spi_message *spi_message_alloc(unsigned ntrans, gfp_t flags)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*m)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct spi_message)...)
#151: FILE: include/linux/spi/spi.h:382:
+	m = kzalloc(sizeof(struct spi_message)

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#372: FILE: Documentation/spi/spi-summary:372:
+    $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
