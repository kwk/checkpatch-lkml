WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'mdio_ctrl', this function's name, in a string
#113: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:900:
+		DPRINTK(PROBE, ERR, "e100.mdio_ctrl(%s) won't go Ready\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#114: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:901:
+		DPRINTK(PROBE, ERR, "e100.mdio_ctrl(%s) won't go Ready\n",
  			nic->netdev->name );

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#123: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:908:
+	 * delay 2us per loop, manual says read should complete in < 64us */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
