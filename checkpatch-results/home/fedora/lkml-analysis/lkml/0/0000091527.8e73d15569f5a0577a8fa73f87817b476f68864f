Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#124: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:242:

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
