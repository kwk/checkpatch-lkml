WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#104: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:6176:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "ide-tape: %s: overriding capabilities->ctl (assuming 26KB)\n", drive->name);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
