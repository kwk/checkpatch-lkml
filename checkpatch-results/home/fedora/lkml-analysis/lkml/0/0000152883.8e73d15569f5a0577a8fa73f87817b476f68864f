#34: 
Bart, any word on this? I know you're busy but it would be much appreciated if 

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#69: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:107:
+struct via82cxxx_dev
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#113: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:144:
+static char* via_print_controller_info(char *p, struct via82cxxx_dev *vdev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#384: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:496:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
