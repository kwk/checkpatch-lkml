Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "sk2"
#65: FILE: ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:176:
+	for( ; sk2 != NULL; sk2 = sk2->bind_next) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'sk2->rcv_saddr == sk->rcv_saddr'
#71: FILE: ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:182:
+				if (!sk2->rcv_saddr	||
+				    !sk->rcv_saddr	||
+				    (sk2->rcv_saddr == sk->rcv_saddr))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
