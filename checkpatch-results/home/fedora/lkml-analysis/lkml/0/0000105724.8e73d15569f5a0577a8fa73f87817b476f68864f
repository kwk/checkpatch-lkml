+       BUG_ON(rq->active == NULL);$

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#59: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1267:
+       BUG_ON(rq->active == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rq->active"
#59: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1267:
+       BUG_ON(rq->active == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
