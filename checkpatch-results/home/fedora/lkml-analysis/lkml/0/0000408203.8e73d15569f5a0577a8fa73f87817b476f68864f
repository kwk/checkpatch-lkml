#48: 
# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#67: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/entry.S	Mon Dec  9 10:56:39 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the

as the last construct.
