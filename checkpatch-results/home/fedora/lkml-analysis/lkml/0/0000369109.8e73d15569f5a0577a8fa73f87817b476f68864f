WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 120 exceeds 100 columns
#109: FILE: include/linux/futex.h:10:
+extern asmlinkage long sys_futex(u32 __user *uaddr, int op, int val, struct timespec __user *utime, u32 __user *uaddr2);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
