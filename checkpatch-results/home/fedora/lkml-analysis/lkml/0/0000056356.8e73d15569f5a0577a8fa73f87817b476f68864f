CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1018:
+extern int apply_to_page_range(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long address,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#85: FILE: mm/memory.c:1376:
+	BUG_ON(pmd_huge(*pmd));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
