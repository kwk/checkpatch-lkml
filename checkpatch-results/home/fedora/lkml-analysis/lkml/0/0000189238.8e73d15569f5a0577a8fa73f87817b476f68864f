+	W[I] = __be64_to_cpu( ((__be64*)input)[I] );

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#83: FILE: crypto/sha512.c:244:
+	index = pad_len = i = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
