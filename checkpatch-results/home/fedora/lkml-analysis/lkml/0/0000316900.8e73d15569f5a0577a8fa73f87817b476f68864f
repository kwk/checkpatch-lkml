CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#161: FILE: drivers/md/dm-crypt.c:310:
+		kcryptd_bio_head = kcryptd_bio_tail = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#239: FILE: drivers/md/dm-crypt.c:728:
+^I                                  0, 0, NULL, NULL);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
