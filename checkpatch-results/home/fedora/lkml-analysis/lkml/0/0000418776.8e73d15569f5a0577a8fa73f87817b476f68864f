ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#45: 
--- a/drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c	Tue Oct 29 09:25:36 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#53: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:44:
+const unsigned char scsi_command_size[8] =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
