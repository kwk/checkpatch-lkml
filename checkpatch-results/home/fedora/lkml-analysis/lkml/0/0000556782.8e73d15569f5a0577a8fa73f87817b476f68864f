CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#73: FILE: drivers/block/ide-disk.c:135:
+		drive->mult_req = drive->mult_count = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
