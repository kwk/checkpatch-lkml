ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#81: FILE: drivers/ide/Makefile:32:
+ide-detect-objs^I:= ide-geometry.o $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#102: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1431:
+void ideprobe_cleanup_module (void)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#108: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1437:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ideprobe_init_module);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#139: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1618:
+extern int ideprobe_init_module(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
