Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'fl->fl_break_time == 0'

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'flock == NULL'
#135: FILE: fs/locks.c:1091:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!flock"
#135: FILE: fs/locks.c:1091:
+	if ((flock == NULL) || !IS_LEASE(flock))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
