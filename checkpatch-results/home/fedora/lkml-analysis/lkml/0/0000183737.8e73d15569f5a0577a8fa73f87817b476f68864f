WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#85: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/b2c2/flexcop.c:70:
+	if ((ret = dvb_register_adapter(&fc->dvb_adapter,"FlexCop Digital TV device",fc->owner)) < 0) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
