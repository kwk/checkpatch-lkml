WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#56: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
