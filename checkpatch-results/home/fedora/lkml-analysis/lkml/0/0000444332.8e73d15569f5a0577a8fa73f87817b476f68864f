WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'usefull' may be misspelled - perhaps 'useful'?
#31: 
  kmem_cache_size is usefull enough to get into the kernel.
                     ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#44: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:60:
+extern unsigned int kmem_cache_size(kmem_cache_t *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'kmem_cache_t *' should also have an identifier name
#44: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:60:
+extern unsigned int kmem_cache_size(kmem_cache_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#68: FILE: mm/slab.c:1654:
+		return (cachep->objsize - 2*BYTES_PER_WORD);
 		                           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
