WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#52: FILE: include/net/sock.h:546:
+	int                     *sockets_allocated;     /* Current number of sockets (percpu counter). */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#64: FILE: include/net/sock.h:586:
+	int cpu;
+	for_each_cpu(cpu)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#103: FILE: net/core/sock.c:774:
+^I^I^Iinc_sockets_allocated(newsk->sk_prot->sockets_allocated); $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "proto->sockets_allocated"
#112: FILE: net/core/sock.c:1623:
+		   proto->sockets_allocated != NULL ? read_sockets_allocated(proto) : -1,

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'tcp_init', this function's name, in a string
#161: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp.c:2060:
+		panic("tcp_init: Cannot alloc tcp_sockets_allocated");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
