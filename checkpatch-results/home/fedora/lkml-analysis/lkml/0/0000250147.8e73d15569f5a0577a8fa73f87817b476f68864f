Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)

+#define NR_PROFILE_HIT		(PAGE_SIZE/sizeof(struct profile_hit))
                       		          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#200: FILE: kernel/profile.c:253:
+		struct profile_hit *hits = per_cpu(cpu_profile_hits, cpu)[j];
+		for (i = 0; i < NR_PROFILE_HIT; ++i) {

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#205: FILE: kernel/profile.c:258:

 		                              ^

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#219: FILE: kernel/profile.c:272:
+	i = primary = pc & (NR_PROFILE_HIT - 1);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#225: FILE: kernel/profile.c:278:
+		if (hits[i].pc == pc) {
[...]
+		} else if (!hits[i].hits) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
