#34: 
# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#62: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/longrun.c	Fri Apr 18 16:07:40 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

#307: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:162:
+			for(i=jiffies+HZ/100;time_before(jiffies, (unsigned long) i););

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#307: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:162:
+			for(i=jiffies+HZ/100;time_before(jiffies, (unsigned long) i););
 				

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
