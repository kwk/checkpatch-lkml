WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#101: FILE: drivers/pnp/pnpbios_core.c:298:
+	status = call_pnp_bios(PNP_GET_SYS_DEV_NODE, 0, PNP_TS1, 0, PNP_TS2, boot ? 2 : 1, PNP_DS, 0,

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
