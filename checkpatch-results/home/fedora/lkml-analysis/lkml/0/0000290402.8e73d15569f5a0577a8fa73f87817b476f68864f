CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#182: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1320:
+		if (to_lock < locked) {
[...]
 		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#330: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3379:
+			struct task_struct *tsk, *tmp;
+			list_for_each_entry_safe(tsk, tmp,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#344: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3391:
+	 * Recheck and go again if we're not the only ones left. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#399: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:668:
+extern void sched_cpu_stop(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
