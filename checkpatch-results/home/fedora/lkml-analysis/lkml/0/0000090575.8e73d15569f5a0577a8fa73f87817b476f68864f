CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#97: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/e820.h:51:
+extern int e820_all_mapped(unsigned long start, unsigned long end, unsigned type);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
