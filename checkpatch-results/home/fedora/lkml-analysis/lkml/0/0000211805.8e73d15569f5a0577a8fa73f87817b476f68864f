CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: include/linux/string.h:91:
+extern char *kstrdup(const char *s, int gfp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#92: FILE: lib/string.c:612:
+	char *buf = kmalloc(strlen(s)+1, gfp);
 	                             ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#93: FILE: lib/string.c:613:
+	char *buf = kmalloc(strlen(s)+1, gfp);
+	if (buf)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
