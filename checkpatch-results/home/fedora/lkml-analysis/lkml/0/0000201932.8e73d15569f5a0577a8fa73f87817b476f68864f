CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#105: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:615:
+	if (err < 0)
[...]
-	else if (res == 1) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#150: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:649:
+	de->time = de->ctime = time;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!slots"
#189: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:678:
+	if (slots == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
