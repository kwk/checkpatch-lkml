WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#67: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:947:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(irq_desc);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#88: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:356:
+	if (dump_in_progress && cpu != dumping_cpu) return;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#136: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:476:
+	if (!(dump_ipi_function_ptr && dump_ipi_function_ptr(regs))) {
+		return 0;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#219: FILE: init/main.c:96:
+extern unsigned long _end;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#252: FILE: kernel/panic.c:26:
+int (*dump_device_register_ptr)(void*) = 0;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#253: FILE: kernel/panic.c:27:
+volatile int dump_in_progress = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
