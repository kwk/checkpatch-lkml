`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#119: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/setup.c:376:
+			else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#158: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/e820.h:58:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
