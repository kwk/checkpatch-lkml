WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#66: FILE: fs/fuse/dir.c:950:
+		struct address_space *mapping = inode->i_mapping;
+		unmap_mapping_range(mapping, offset + PAGE_SIZE - 1, 0, 1);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
