WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#327: FILE: init/Kconfig:101:
+config IKCONFIG
+	bool "Kernel .config support"
+	---help---
+	  This option enables the complete Linux kernel ".config" file
+	  contents, information on compiler used to build the kernel,
+	  kernel running when this kernel was built and kernel version
+	  from Makefile to be saved in kernel. It provides documentation
+	  of which kernel options are used in a running kernel or in an
+	  on-disk kernel.  This information can be extracted from the kernel
+	  image file with the script scripts/extract-ikconfig and used as
+	  input to rebuild the current kernel or to build another kernel.
+	  It can also be extracted from a running kernel by reading
+	  /proc/ikconfig/config and /proc/ikconfig/built_with, if enabled.
+	  /proc/ikconfig/config will list the configuration that was used
+	  to build the kernel and /proc/ikconfig/built_with will list
+	  information on the compiler and host machine that was used to
+	  build the kernel.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

#359: FILE: kernel/configs.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#360: FILE: kernel/configs.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#379: FILE: kernel/configs.c:21:
+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name

  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#454: FILE: kernel/configs.c:96:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#509: FILE: kernel/configs.c:151:
+	current_config = create_proc_entry("config", S_IFREG | S_IRUGO,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
