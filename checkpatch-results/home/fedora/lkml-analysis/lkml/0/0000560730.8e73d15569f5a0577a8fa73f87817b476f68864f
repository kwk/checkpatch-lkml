Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#121: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:110:
+		if (curtask->files->fd[i]) close(i);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#129: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:116:
+		struct user_struct *user = curtask->user;
+		curtask->user = INIT_USER;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#140: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:124:
+	curtask->euid = curtask->fsuid = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
