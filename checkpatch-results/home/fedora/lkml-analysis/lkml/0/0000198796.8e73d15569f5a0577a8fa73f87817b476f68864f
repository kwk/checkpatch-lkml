CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <ucDmaCmd>
#45: FILE: include/asm-ppc/dma.h:194:
+	unsigned char ucDmaCmd = 0x00;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#209: FILE: include/asm-ppc/dma.h:361:
+extern int request_dma(unsigned int dmanr, const char *device_id);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
