#28: 
Since my BIOS does not support my disk (WD400) I had to clip to 33.8G.  At boot time Linux (2.4.17) uses the lba size reported by the disk, that is 33.8 and does not allow me to access the rest of the disk.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'drivers' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#51: FILE: ide/ide-disk.c:515:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
