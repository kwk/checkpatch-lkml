WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *			bar" should be "foo *bar"
#92: FILE: drivers/char/rio/port.h:226:
+	char *			p;			/* save the global struct here .. */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <PortP>
#103: FILE: drivers/char/rio/riotty.c:195:
+	PortP = p->RIOPortp[SysPort];	/* Get control struct */

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <RIOPortp>
#103: FILE: drivers/char/rio/riotty.c:195:
+	PortP = p->RIOPortp[SysPort];	/* Get control struct */

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SysPort>
#103: FILE: drivers/char/rio/riotty.c:195:
+	PortP = p->RIOPortp[SysPort];	/* Get control struct */

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#114: FILE: drivers/net/wan/lmc/lmc_main.c:644:
+        printk("LMC: Corrupt net_device struct, breaking out\n");$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#114: FILE: drivers/net/wan/lmc/lmc_main.c:644:
+        printk("LMC: Corrupt net_device struct, breaking out\n");$

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#114: FILE: drivers/net/wan/lmc/lmc_main.c:644:
+        printk("LMC: Corrupt net_device struct, breaking out\n");

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#125: FILE: drivers/scsi/FlashPoint.c:152:
+/* SCCB struct used for both SCCB and UCB manager compiles! $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#147: FILE: include/linux/pfkeyv2.h:107:
+		sizeof(struct sadb_comb)]; */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
