WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#85: FILE: include/asm-m68k/system.h:198:
+static inline unsigned long cmpxchg(volatile int *p, int old, int new)

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#91: FILE: include/asm-m68k/system.h:204:
+	if ((prev = *p) == old)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#94: FILE: include/asm-m68k/system.h:207:
+	return(prev);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
