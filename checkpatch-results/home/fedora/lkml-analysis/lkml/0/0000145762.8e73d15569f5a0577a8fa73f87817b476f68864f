#41: 
Sorry about the messy previous patch.  Would you consider something like the

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*toc)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct atapi_toc)...)
#67: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:2214:
+		toc = kmalloc(sizeof(struct atapi_toc), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*info)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct cdrom_info)...)
#265: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:3456:
+	info = kmalloc(sizeof(struct cdrom_info), GFP_KERNEL);
