WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#187: FILE: include/linux/topology.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#188: FILE: include/linux/topology.h:2:
+ * linux/include/linux/topology.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'defintions' may be misspelled - perhaps 'definitions'?
#225: FILE: include/linux/topology.h:39:
+ * Generic defintions:
            ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'this_rq->nr_running > this_rq->prev_cpu_load[this_cpu]'
#358: FILE: kernel/sched.c:786:
+			if (idle || (this_rq->nr_running > this_rq->prev_cpu_load[this_cpu]))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'rq_src->nr_running < this_rq->prev_cpu_load[i]'
#384: FILE: kernel/sched.c:838:

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)

                                ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#457: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1017:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
