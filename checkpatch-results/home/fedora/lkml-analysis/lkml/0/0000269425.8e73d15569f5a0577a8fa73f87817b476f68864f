#25: 
As pointed by Thomas Sailer, crc16.c module contains CRC16-CCITT (x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config CRC_CCITT

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#80: FILE: lib/crc-ccitt.c:2:
+ *	linux/lib/crc-ccitt.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#232: FILE: include/linux/crc-ccitt.h:8:
+extern u16 crc_ccitt(u16 crc, const u8 *buffer, size_t len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
