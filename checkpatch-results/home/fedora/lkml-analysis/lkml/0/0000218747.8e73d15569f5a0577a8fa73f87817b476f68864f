WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#30: 
helper, which takes into account yesterday's suggestions.  The selinux/hooks.c

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'definately' may be misspelled - perhaps 'definitely'?
#31: 
typo was definately a dangerous bug, and __vm_enough_memory() has been moved
         ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:707:
+extern int __vm_enough_memory(long pages, int cap_sys_admin);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#127: FILE: mm/mmap.c:131:
+^I       ^I* sysctl_overcommit_ratio / 100;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#127: FILE: mm/mmap.c:131:
+^I       ^I* sysctl_overcommit_ratio / 100;$

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#136: FILE: mm/mmap.c:140:
+	/* Don't let a single process grow too big:
+	   leave 3% of the size of this process for other processes */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#136: FILE: mm/mmap.c:140:
