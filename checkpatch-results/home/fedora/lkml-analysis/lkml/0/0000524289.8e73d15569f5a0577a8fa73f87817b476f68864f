WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#31:

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'include' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#48: FILE: linux/slab.h:8:
+#warning Please do not include linux/slab.h directly, use linux/malloc.h instead.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
