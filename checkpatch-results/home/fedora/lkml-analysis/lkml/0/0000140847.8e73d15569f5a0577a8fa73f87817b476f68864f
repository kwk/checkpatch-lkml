WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'kmem_cache_create', this function's name, in a string
#103: FILE: mm/slab.c:1546:
+			printk("kmem_cache_create: duplicate cache %s\n", name);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
