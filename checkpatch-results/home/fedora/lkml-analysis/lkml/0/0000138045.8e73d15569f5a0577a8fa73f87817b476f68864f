WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_driver *' should also have an identifier name
#100: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:436:
+int __pci_register_driver(struct pci_driver *, struct module *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#189: FILE: drivers/ide/setup-pci.c:814:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(__ide_pci_register_driver);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#210: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1327:
+extern int __ide_pci_register_driver(struct pci_driver *driver, struct module *owner);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
