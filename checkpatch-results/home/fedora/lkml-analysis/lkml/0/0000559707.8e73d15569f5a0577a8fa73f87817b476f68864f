             ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that '!' (ctx:WxW)
#92: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:54:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#121: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:150:
+^I^I      ^I> page->zone->pages_high + inactive_target &&$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#121: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:150:
+^I^I      ^I> page->zone->pages_high + inactive_target &&$

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#141: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:372:
+void enforce_rss_limit(struct mm_struct * mm, int gfp_mask)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#144: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:375:
+	struct vm_area_struct* vma;

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#150: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:381:
+	address = mm->swap_address = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#158: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:389:
+^I * Find the proper vm-area after freezing the vma chain $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
