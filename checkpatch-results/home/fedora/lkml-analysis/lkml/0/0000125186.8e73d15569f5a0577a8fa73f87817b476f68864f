WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#40: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/auerswald.c:1699:
+        dbg ("auerchar_write %zd bytes", len);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#40: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/auerswald.c:1699:
+        dbg ("auerchar_write %zd bytes", len);$

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#40: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/auerswald.c:1699:
+        dbg ("auerchar_write %zd bytes", len);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'auerchar_write', this function's name, in a string
#40: FILE: drivers/usb/misc/auerswald.c:1699:
+        dbg ("auerchar_write %zd bytes", len);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
