ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#62: 
--- a/drivers/acpi/hardware/hwsleep.c	2005-06-07 13:45:04.088273424 +0800

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#72: FILE: drivers/acpi/hardware/hwsleep.c:249:

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#73: FILE: drivers/acpi/hardware/hwsleep.c:250:
+static unsigned char jump_to_pm [] =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
