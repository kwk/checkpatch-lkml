WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#65: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1136:
+	BUG_ON(sizeof(req->cmd) > sizeof(cmd->cmnd));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#74: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1145:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SCpnt>
#103: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:234:
+		scsi_setup_blk_pc_cmnd(SCpnt, SD_PASSTHROUGH_RETRIES);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_cmnd.h:153:
+extern void scsi_setup_blk_pc_cmnd(struct scsi_cmnd *cmd, int retries);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
