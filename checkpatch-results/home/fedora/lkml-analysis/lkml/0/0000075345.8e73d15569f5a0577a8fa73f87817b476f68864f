#67: 
I'm sending you a test case and a small kernel patch (see attachments).   The 

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#144: FILE: mm/memory.c:2481:
+	if (pid >= 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
