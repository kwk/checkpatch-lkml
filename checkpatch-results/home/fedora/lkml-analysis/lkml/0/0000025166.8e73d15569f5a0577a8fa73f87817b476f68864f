CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "timers[node]"
#113: FILE: drivers/char/mmtimer.c:750:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
