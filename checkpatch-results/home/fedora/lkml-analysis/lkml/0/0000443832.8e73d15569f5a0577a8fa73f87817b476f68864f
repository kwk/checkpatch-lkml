CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#40: FILE: fs/nfs/dir.c:336:
+	desc->entry->cookie = desc->entry->prev_cookie = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#99: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs3xdr.c:617:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#100: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs3xdr.c:618:
+			memset((u8*)(entry->fh), 0, sizeof(*entry->fh));

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
