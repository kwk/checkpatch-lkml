Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#238: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:443:
+	extern char __kprobes_text_start[], __kprobes_text_end[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#239: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:444:
+	extern char __kprobes_text_start[], __kprobes_text_end[];
+	if (addr >= (unsigned long)__kprobes_text_start

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#251: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:456:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
