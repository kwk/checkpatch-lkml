CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#121: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:158:
+extern void rebuild_sched_domains(cpumask_t span1, cpumask_t span2);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!par"
#332: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:610:
+	if (par == NULL || cpus_empty(cur->cpus_allowed))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#347: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:625:
+	}
+	else {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#347: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:625:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#370: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:646:
+	trialcs = oldcs = *cs;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#384: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:657:
+^Iif (is_cpu_exclusive(cs) && $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#424: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:715:
+                update_cpu_domains(cs);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
