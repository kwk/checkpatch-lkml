structures. At the moment this is all read-only, however we could think about

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct veth_lpar_connection *' should also have an identifier name
#57: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:284:
+	ssize_t (*show)(struct veth_lpar_connection *, char *buf);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct sysfs_ops should normally be const
#116: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:343:
+static struct sysfs_ops veth_cnx_sysfs_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'failes' may be misspelled - perhaps 'fails'?
#151: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:1607:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#152: FILE: drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:1608:

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.
