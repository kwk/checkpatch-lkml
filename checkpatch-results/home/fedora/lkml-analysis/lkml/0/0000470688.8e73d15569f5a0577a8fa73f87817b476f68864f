#24: 
This serial driver patch modifies function line_info() which assembles text 

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#102: FILE: drivers/char/serial.c:3264:
+	if (state->type == PORT_UNKNOWN) {
+		return 0;	/* ignore unused ports */
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#108: FILE: drivers/char/serial.c:3270:
+^I^I      state->line, uart_config[state->type].name, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
