+	  If you have a sound card in your computer, i.e. if it can say more
+	  than an occasional beep, say Y.  Be sure to have all the information
+	  about your sound card and its configuration down (I/O port,
+	  interrupt and DMA channel), because you will be asked for it.
+
+	  You want to read the Sound-HOWTO, available from
+	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>. General information about
+	  the modular sound system is contained in the files
+	  <file:Documentation/sound/Introduction>.  The file
+	  <file:Documentation/sound/README.OSS> contains some slightly
+	  outdated but still useful information as well.
+
+	  If you have a PnP sound card and you want to configure it at boot
+	  time using the ISA PnP tools (read
+	  <http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/>), then you need to
+	  compile the sound card support as a module ( = code which can be
+	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want)
+	  and load that module after the PnP configuration is finished.  To do
+	  this, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
+	  as <file:Documentation/sound/README.modules>; the module will be
+	  called soundcore.o.
+
+	  I'm told that even without a sound card, you can make your computer
+	  say more than an occasional beep, by programming the PC speaker.
+	  Kernel patches and supporting utilities to do that are in the pcsp
+	  package, available at <ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/pcsp/>.
