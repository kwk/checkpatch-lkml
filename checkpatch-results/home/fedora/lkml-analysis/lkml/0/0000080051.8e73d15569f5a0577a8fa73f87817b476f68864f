# HG changeset patch

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#119: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:127:
+extern int core_kernel_text(unsigned long addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#151: FILE: kernel/module.c:713:
+	if (!(modaddr = module_text_address((unsigned long)addr)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
