WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#63: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/sn2/sn_proc_fs.c:101:
+		struct file_operations *f;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
