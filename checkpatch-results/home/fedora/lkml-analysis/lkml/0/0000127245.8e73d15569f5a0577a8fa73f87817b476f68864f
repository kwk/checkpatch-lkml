WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dvb_frontend_ops should normally be const
#65: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/b2c2/flexcop-fe-tuner.c:488:
+	struct dvb_frontend_ops *ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ops->release"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
