CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*cp)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct i2o_workqueue)...)
#102: FILE: drivers/message/i2o/exec-osm.c:425:
+		cp = kmalloc(sizeof(struct i2o_workqueue), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#111: FILE: drivers/message/i2o/exec-osm.c:432:
+			printk(KERN_DEBUG "i2o_exec_reply:"

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'i2o_exec_reply', this function's name, in a string
#111: FILE: drivers/message/i2o/exec-osm.c:432:
+			printk(KERN_DEBUG "i2o_exec_reply:"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#112: FILE: drivers/message/i2o/exec-osm.c:433:
+			printk(KERN_DEBUG "i2o_exec_reply:"
+				" call to queue_work() failed.\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
