WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#131: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:294:
+		mod_timer(&psmouse->ping_timer, psmouse->last + msecs_to_jiffies(psmouse->ping_interval));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#222: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:967:
+	value = simple_strtoul(buf, &rest, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
