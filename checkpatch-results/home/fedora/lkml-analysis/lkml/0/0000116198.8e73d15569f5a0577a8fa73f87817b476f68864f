Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#169: FILE: fs/exec.c:1126:
+extern spinlock_t proposed_global_lock;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
