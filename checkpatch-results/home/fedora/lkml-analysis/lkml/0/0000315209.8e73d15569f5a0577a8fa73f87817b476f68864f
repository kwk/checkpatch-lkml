Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#43: FILE: drivers/scsi/53c7xx.h:1603:
+extern int ncr53c7xx_init(Scsi_Host_Template *tpnt, int board, int chip,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
