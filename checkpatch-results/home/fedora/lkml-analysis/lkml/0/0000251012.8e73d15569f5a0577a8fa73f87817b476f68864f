CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:28:
+extern char *cpuset_task_status_allowed(struct task_struct *task, char *buffer);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#104: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:57:
+static inline char *cpuset_task_status_allowed(struct task_struct *task,
+							char *buffer)
