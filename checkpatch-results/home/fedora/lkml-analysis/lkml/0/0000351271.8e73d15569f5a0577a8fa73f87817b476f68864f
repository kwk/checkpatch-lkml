Wouldn't it be more accurate to take 1 as a better approximation for something

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#165: FILE: kernel/sched.c:336:
+^I    likely(!rt_task(p)) && $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#167: FILE: kernel/sched.c:338:
+	    likely(!p->activated_list.next)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
