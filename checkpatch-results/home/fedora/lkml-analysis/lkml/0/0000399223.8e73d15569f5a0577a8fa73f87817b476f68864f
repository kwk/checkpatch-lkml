#27: 
mmap'ing kernel virtual addresses above high_memory using /dev/kmem returns different results than reads of /dev/kmem.  The problem occurs because the call to remap_page_range in mmap_mem assumes a physically-contiguous region of memory that is allocated below high_memory; this isn't the case for (e.g.) vmalloc'd memory.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#86: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:568:
+struct vm_operations_struct kmem_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
