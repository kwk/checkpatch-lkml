#27: 
[PATCH] w1: Adds a default family so that new slave families will show up in sysfs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#56: FILE: drivers/w1/w1.c:66:
+	struct w1_slave *sl = container_of(dev, struct w1_slave, dev);
+	return(sprintf(buf, "%s\n", sl->name));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#56: FILE: drivers/w1/w1.c:66:
+	return(sprintf(buf, "%s\n", sl->name));

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
