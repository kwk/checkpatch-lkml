WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#74: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:135:
+	extern unsigned long nr_deferred_pages(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#276: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:191:
+				deferred_page = list_entry(area->deferred_pages.next, struct page, list);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#282: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:197:
+			 * Fall through and also free the page we were

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#437: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:389:
+	if (likely(!list_empty(&area->deferred_pages))) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
