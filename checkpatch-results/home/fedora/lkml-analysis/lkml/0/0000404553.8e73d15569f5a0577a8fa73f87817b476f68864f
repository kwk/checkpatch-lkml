Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as

--- a/arch/i386/Kconfig	Sat Dec 28 17:11:27 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
