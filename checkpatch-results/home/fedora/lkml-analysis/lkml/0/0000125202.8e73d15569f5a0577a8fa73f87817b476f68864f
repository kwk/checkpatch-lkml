WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#40: FILE: fs/xfs/quota/xfs_qm.c:81:
+STATIC int	xfs_qm_shake(int, gfp_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#40: FILE: fs/xfs/quota/xfs_qm.c:81:
+STATIC int	xfs_qm_shake(int, gfp_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'gfp_t' should also have an identifier name
#40: FILE: fs/xfs/quota/xfs_qm.c:81:
+STATIC int	xfs_qm_shake(int, gfp_t);
