CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#148: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/cs.c:344:
+	socket->erase_busy.next = socket->erase_busy.prev = &socket->erase_busy;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#163: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/cs.c:359:
+	BUG_ON(!socket->thread);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#210: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/cs.c:777:

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#211: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/cs.c:778:
