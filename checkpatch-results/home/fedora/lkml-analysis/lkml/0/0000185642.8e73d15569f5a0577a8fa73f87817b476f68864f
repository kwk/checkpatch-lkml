WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#119: FILE: arch/ppc64/mm/init.c:635:
+	 * presence of all LMBs*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
