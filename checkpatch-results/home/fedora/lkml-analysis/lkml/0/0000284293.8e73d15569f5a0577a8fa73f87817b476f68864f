Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#153: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:518:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(release_lapic_nmi_watchdog);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern int reassign_lapic_nmi_watchdog(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
