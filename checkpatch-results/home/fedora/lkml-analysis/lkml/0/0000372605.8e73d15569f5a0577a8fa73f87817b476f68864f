ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#47: 
--- a/drivers/i2c/i2c-core.c	Tue May  6 17:24:37 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
