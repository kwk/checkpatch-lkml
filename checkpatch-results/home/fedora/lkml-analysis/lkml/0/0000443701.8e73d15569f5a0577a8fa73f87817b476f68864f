ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#62: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:1244:
+	static u_short	power_event_state = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#84: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:1265:
+		u_short status, bat, life;
+		error = apm_get_power_status(&status, &bat, &life);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#85: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:1266:
+		if (error == APM_SUCCESS && (status ^ last_power_status) & 0xff00) {
[...]
+		} else if (error != APM_SUCCESS)

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
