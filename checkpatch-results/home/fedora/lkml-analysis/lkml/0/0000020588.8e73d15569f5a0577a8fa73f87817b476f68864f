Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"

+	struct bio* raid_bi  = bi->bi_private;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'chunk_aligned_read', this function's name, in a string
#80: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:2674:
+		printk("chunk_aligned_read : non aligned\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
