WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#33: 
Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#70: FILE: fs/cachefs/super.c:397:
+	if (bdev_read_only(sb->s_bdev)) {
+		printk("CacheFS: blockdev read-only\n");
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
