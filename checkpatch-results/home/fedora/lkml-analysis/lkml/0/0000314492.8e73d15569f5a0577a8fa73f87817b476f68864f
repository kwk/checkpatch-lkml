WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'hda' may be misspelled - perhaps 'had'?
#45: 
Looking at the code it is clear that when I get these messages, the hwif will then be marked "not present" (ie. hwif->present = 0) and the drives (hda, hdb and hdc in my case) will also be marked not present.
                                                                                                                                                   ^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#75: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1346:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
