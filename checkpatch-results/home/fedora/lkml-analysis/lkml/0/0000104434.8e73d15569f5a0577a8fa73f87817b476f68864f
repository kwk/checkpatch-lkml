CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#75: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:2253:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#78: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:2256:
+	void			(*fn)(void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*wqw)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct work_queue_work)...)
#116: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:2294:
+	wqw = kmalloc(sizeof(struct work_queue_work), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#119: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:2297:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "Failed to allocate memory\n");
