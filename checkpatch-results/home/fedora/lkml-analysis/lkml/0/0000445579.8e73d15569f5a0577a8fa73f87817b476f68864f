WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 148 exceeds 100 columns
#38: FILE: drivers/net/tlan.c:1539:
+				head_list->buffer[0].address = pci_map_single(priv->pciDev, new_skb->data, TLAN_MAX_FRAME_SIZE, PCI_DMA_FROMDEVICE);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
