WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'read_output', this function's name, in a string
#92: FILE: arch/um/drivers/net_user.c:85:
+		printk("read_output - read of %s failed, errno = %d\n", str, -ret);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#94: FILE: arch/um/drivers/net_user.c:87:
+		printk("read_output - read of %s failed, read only %d of %d bytes\n", str, ret, expected);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
