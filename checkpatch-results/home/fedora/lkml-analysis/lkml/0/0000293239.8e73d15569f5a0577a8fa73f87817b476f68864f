Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*r)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct entropy_store)...)
#64: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:522:
+	r = kmalloc(sizeof(struct entropy_store)+POOLBYTES, GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#225: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:1880:
+	max_read_thresh = max_write_thresh = pool->poolinfo->POOLBITS;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
