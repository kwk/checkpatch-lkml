Subject: [PATCH] BUG() on inconsistant dcache tree in may_delete
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#45: FILE: fs/namei.c:1101:
+	BUG_ON(victim->d_parent->d_inode != dir);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
