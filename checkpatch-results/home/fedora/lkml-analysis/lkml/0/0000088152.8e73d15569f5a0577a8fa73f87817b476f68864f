WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#76: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:2499:
+ * as a unique cookie to identify our (NFSv4's) posix locks. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct lock_manager_operations should normally be const
#77: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:2500:
+struct lock_manager_operations nfsd_posix_mng_ops  = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
