+	if (tfm == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#92: FILE: base/firmware_class.c:636:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(firmware_version);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
