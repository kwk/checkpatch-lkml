Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
