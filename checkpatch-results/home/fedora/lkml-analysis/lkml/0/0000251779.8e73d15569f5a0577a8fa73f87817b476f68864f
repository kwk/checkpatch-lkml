CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#93: FILE: kernel/nproc.c:52:
+	if (!mm)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#130: FILE: kernel/nproc.c:94:
+			if (atomic_read(&mm->mm_count) > 1) ||

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#158: FILE: kernel/nproc.c:122:
+		stats->vmexe = stats->vmlib = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
