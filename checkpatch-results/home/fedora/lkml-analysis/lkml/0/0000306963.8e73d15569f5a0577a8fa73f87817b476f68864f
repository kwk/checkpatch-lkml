ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#74: 
--- a/drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c	Mon Feb  2 23:35:33 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#82: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:624:
+	if (atkbd->set == 4) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#99: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:641:
+			atkbd->keycode[i | 0x80] = atkbd_set2_keycode[atkbd_unxlate_table[i] | 0x80];

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
