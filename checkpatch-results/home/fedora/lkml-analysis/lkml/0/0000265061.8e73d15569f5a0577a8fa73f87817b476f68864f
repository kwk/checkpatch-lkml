CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around mxvar_table[i * MXSER_PORTS_PER_BOARD]
#177: FILE: drivers/char/mxser.c:1439:
+		if (dev_id == &(mxvar_table[i * MXSER_PORTS_PER_BOARD])) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#201: FILE: drivers/char/mxser.c:1463:
+			if (!info->tty ||
+			  (inb(info->base + UART_IIR) & UART_IIR_NO_INT))

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#211: FILE: drivers/char/mxser.c:1473:
+/* 8-2-99 by William
+   if ( info->x_char || (info->xmit_cnt > 0) )

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
