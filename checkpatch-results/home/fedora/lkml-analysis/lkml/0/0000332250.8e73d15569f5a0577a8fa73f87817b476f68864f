WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#154: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:521:
+static inline void set_abs_params(struct input_dev *dev, int axis, int min, int max, int fuzz, int flat)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'incase' may be misspelled - perhaps 'in case'?

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#191: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:574:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
