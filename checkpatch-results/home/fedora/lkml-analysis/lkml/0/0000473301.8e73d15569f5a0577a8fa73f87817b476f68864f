Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#77: 
--- a/drivers/scsi/sd.c	Thu Feb 28 20:04:49 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#98: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:867:
+	do {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#99: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:868:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#107: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:876:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
