ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#47: 
--- a/include/linux/ioport.h	Fri Feb 14 09:50:44 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while loop
#53: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:110:
+#define rename_region(resource, n)	(resource)->name = (n);

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#53: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:110:
+#define rename_region(resource, n)	(resource)->name = (n);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
