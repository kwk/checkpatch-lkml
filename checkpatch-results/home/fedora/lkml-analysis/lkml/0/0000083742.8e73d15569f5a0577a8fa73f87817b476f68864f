WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#87: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1773:
+	struct task_struct *tsk = current;
+	read_lock(&tasklist_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tsk"
#92: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1778:
+		if (tsk == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'tsk != current'
#94: FILE: kernel/sys.c:1780:
+		if ((tsk != current) && security_ptrace(current, tsk))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
