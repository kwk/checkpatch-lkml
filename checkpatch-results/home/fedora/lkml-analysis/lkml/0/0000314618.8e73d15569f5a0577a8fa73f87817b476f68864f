ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/arch/i386/Kconfig	2004-01-04 03:10:01.000000000 +0100

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/
