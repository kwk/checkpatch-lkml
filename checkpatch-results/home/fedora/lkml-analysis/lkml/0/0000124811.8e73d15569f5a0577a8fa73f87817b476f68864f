ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#63: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c:408:
+static void scsi_target_reap_work(void *data) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#97: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c:443:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
