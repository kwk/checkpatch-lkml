WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#42: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/setup.c:316:
+			extern void nonx_setup(char *str);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
