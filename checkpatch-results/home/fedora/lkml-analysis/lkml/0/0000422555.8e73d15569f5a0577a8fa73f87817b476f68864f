#34: 
.config and a description of what filesytems you're using?
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct address_space_operations should normally be const
#265: FILE: drivers/block/rd.c:311:
+struct address_space_operations ramdisk_aops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'uptodate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'up-to-date'?
#369: FILE: fs/buffer.c:401:
+	 * partially uptodate by mkfs and unmap_underlying_metadata searches
