ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#74: 
--- a/drivers/base/bus.c	Tue Jul 15 19:23:44 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "kobj"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
