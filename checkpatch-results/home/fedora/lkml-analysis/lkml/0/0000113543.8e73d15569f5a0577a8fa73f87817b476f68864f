#31: 
page from the LRU, thus a 0 refcount page will never have its refcount elevated

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#67: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:297:
+	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&page->_count) == -1);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
