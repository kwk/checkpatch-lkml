WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#112: FILE: mm/filemap.c:442:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#207: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:173:
+#define mark_page_accessed(page)	\
+do {					\
+	SetPageReferenced(page);	\
+} while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#305: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:599:
+			} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#383: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:848:
+	if (count > zone->nr_inactive / 2

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#384: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:849:
+		|| (!(laptop_mode && !sc->may_writepage)
+			&& count > SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX)) {

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#386: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:851:

 		                                      ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
