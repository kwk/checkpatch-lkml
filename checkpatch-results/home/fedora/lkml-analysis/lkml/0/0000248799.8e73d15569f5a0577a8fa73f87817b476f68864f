Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#126: FILE: include/linux/smp.h:113:
+#ifdef __smp_processor_id $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: include/linux/smp.h:115:
+   extern unsigned int smp_processor_id(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTK_RATELIMITED: Prefer printk_ratelimited or pr_<level>_ratelimited to printk_ratelimit

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'smp_processor_id', this function's name, in a string
#237: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2330:
+	printk(KERN_ERR "using smp_processor_id() in preemptible code: %s/%d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
