WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'artifical' may be misspelled - perhaps 'artificial'?
#37: 
several thousand artifical pci errors injected onto ethernet and scsi
                 ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_dn *' should also have an identifier name
#79: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/ppc-pci.h:105:
+int rtas_read_config(struct pci_dn *, int where, int size, u32 *val);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#115: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/eeh.c:109:
+#define IS_BRIDGE(class_code) (((class_code)<<16) == PCI_BASE_CLASS_BRIDGE)
                                             ^
