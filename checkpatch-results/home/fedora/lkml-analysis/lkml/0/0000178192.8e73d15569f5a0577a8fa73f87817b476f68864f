ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#42: 
--- a/drivers/acpi/asus_acpi.c	2005-04-26 00:38:20.000000000 +0200

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buffer.pointer"
#49: FILE: drivers/acpi/asus_acpi.c:995:
+	if (buffer.pointer == NULL || buffer.length == 0) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
