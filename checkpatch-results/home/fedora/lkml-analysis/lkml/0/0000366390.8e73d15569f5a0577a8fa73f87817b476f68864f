CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#172: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:205:
+			if (writing) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#176: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:209:
+			} else

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#198: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:231:
+	rq->bio = rq->biotail = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#223: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:270:
+		int len = min((unsigned int) hdr.mx_sb_len, rq->sense_len);

WARNING:MINMAX: min() should probably be min_t(unsigned int, hdr.mx_sb_len, rq->sense_len)
#223: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:270:
+		int len = min((unsigned int) hdr.mx_sb_len, rq->sense_len);
