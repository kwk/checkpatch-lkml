WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+       if(CmdBlkP == NULL){
+         return NULL;
+       }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!CmdBlkP"
#35: FILE: drivers/char/rio/riocmd.c:626:
+       if(CmdBlkP == NULL){

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#36: FILE: drivers/char/rio/riocmd.c:627:
+         return NULL;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
