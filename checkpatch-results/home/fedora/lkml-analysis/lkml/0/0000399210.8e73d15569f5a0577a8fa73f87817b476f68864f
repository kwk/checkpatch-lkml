CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#121: FILE: kernel/sched.c:751:
+	this_load = maxload = (this_rq()->prev_node_load[this_node] >> 1)

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#130: FILE: kernel/sched.c:760:
+		if (load > maxload && (100*load > NODE_THRESHOLD*this_load)) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'this_rq->nr_balanced'
#146: FILE: kernel/sched.c:775:
+	if (++(this_rq->nr_balanced) == NODE_BALANCE_RATE) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#148: FILE: kernel/sched.c:777:
+		int node = find_busiest_node(this_node);
+		this_rq->nr_balanced = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
