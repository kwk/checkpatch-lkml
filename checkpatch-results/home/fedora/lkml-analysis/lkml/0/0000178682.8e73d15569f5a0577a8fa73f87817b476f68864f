#36: 
I am not totally happy with the way the default congestion control value is determined

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:1245:
+extern int tcp_set_congestion_control(const char *name);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#174: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_cong.c:132:
+	BUG_ON(list_empty(&tcp_cong_list));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#203: FILE: net/ipv4/sysctl_net_ipv4.c:120:
+static int proc_tcp_congestion_control(ctl_table *ctl, int write, struct file * filp,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
