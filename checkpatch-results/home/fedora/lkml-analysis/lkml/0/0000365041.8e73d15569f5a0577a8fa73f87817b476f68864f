CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#49: FILE: drivers/char/n_tty.c:714:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#58: FILE: drivers/char/n_tty.c:723:
+	if (tty->fasync)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
