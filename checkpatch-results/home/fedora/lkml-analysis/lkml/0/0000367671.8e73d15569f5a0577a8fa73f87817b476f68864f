ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#98: FILE: drivers/s390/char/sclp.c:54:
+static volatile unsigned long sclp_status = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#226: FILE: drivers/s390/char/sclp_con.c:76:
+	struct sclp_buffer* buffer;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!buffer"
#233: FILE: drivers/s390/char/sclp_con.c:83:
+	if (buffer == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

+		       "tty_register_driver returned %d\n", rc);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
