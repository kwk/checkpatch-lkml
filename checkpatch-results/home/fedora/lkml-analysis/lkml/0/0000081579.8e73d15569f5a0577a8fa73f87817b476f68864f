Subject: [PATCH] Sparse fixes for synclink_cs

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#44: FILE: drivers/char/pcmcia/synclink_cs.c:847:
+static void bh_handler(void* Context)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
