WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#74: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.c:1661:
+				rv = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
