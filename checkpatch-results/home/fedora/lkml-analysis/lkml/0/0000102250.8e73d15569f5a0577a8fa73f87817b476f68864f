WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#44: FILE: include/asm-m68k/bitops.h:354:
+#define ext2_set_bit(nr, addr)			__test_and_set_bit((nr) ^ 24, (unsigned long *)(addr))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
