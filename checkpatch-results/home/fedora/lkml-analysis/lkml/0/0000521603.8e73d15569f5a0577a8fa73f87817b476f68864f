WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'lvm_chr_open', this function's name, in a string
#90: FILE: drivers/md/lvm.c:575:
+	P_DEV("%s -- lvm_chr_open MINOR: %d  VG#: %d  mode: 0x%X  lock: %d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#170: FILE: drivers/md/lvm.c:947:
+			lvm_name, (long) arg, kdevname(inode->i_rdev));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
