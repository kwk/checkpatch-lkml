WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#69: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/ioctl32.c:4284:
+#define IOCTL_TABLE_END \
+	}; struct ioctl_trans ioctl_end[0];

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#216: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/sparc64_ksyms.c:92:
+extern int compat_ioctl(unsigned int fd, unsigned int cmd, u32 arg);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
