CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#117: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:867:
+		de[0].adate = de[0].cdate = de[1].adate = de[1].cdate = date;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#179: FILE: fs/fat/inode.c:517:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(fat_sync_inode);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#319: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs.h:352:
+extern int fat_sync_inode(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
