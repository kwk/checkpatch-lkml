- as you proposed a while back, code from arch-specific pcibios_fixup_bus() is

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_dev *' should also have an identifier name
#72: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:504:
+void pcibios_set_bridge_ctl(struct pci_dev *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
