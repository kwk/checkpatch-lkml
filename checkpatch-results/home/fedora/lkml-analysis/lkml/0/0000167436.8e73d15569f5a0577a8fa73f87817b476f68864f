CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#64: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mpc.c:301:
+	if (!(i2c = kmalloc(sizeof(*i2c), GFP_KERNEL))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#64: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mpc.c:301:
+	if (!(i2c = kmalloc(sizeof(*i2c), GFP_KERNEL))) {
+		return -ENOMEM;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
