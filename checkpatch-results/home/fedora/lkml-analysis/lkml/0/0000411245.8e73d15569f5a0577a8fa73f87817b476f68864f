ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#51: 
--- a/net/core/dev.c	Sun Nov 24 12:45:07 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#214: FILE: net/core/dev.c:1840:
+static struct seq_operations dev_seq_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

+static struct file_operations dev_seq_fops = {

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#238: FILE: net/core/dev.c:1864:
+	p = create_proc_entry("dev", S_IRUGO, proc_net);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
