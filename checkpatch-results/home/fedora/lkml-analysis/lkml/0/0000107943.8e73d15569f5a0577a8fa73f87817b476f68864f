CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#98: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:82:
+		nr_user = todo = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#147: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:122:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
