CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#39: FILE: linux/list.h:93:
+	entry->next = entry->prev = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
