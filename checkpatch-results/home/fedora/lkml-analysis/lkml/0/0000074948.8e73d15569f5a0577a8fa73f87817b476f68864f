CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!count"
#167: FILE: fs/dcache.c:409:
+	int cnt = (count == NULL) ? -1 : *count;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#172: FILE: fs/dcache.c:414:
+		dentry = list_entry(sb->s_dentry_lru.prev,
+					struct dentry, d_lru);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#174: FILE: fs/dcache.c:416:
+		BUG_ON(dentry->d_sb != sb);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#188: FILE: fs/dcache.c:430:
+		 * clear the flags and put it back on the LRU */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#216: FILE: fs/dcache.c:460:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
