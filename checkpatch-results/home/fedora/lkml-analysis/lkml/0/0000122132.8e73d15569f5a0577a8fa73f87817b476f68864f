Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#177: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2683:
+			unsigned long order;
+			for (order = 0; ((1UL << order) << PAGE_SHIFT) < size; order++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#179: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2685:
+			bitmask = (void*) __get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC, order);

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#179: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2685:
+			bitmask = (void*) __get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC, order);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
