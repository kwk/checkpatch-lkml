Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#59: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:596:

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#59: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:596:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#98: FILE: include/linux/pm.h:253:
+extern int device_suspend(enum suspend_state reason);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#126: FILE: include/linux/pm.h:281:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#156: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:66:
+	/* Valid image is on the disk, if we continue we risk serious data corruption

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
