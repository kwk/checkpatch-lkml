WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#84: FILE: Makefile:756:
+	$(Q)$(MAKE) -rR -f $(srctree)/scripts/Makefile.modinst

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#212: FILE: scripts/modpost.c:365:
+	 * symbols. (Otherwise, there might be too many). */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#233: FILE: scripts/modpost.c:566:
+		struct module *mod;
+		if (!(mod = find_module(modname))) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#233: FILE: scripts/modpost.c:566:
+		if (!(mod = find_module(modname))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#239: FILE: scripts/modpost.c:572:
+	if (!feof(file)) {
+		fatal("parse error in symbol dump file\n");
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#277: FILE: scripts/modpost.c:610:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {

  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
