+/* Look up a pgd entry in the gate area.  On IA-64, the gate-area
+   resides in the kernel-mapped segment, hence we use pgd_offset_k()

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
