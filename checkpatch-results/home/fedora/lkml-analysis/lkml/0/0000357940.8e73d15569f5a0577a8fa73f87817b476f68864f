WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#67: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:97:
+#define __raise_softirq_irqoff(nr) do { local_softirq_pending() |= 1UL << (nr); } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:98:
+extern void FASTCALL(raise_softirq_irqoff(unsigned int nr));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
