CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*iter)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ccwdev_iter)...)
#54: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/blacklist.c:302:
+	iter = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ccwdev_iter), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
