CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#161: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:160:
+extern void sched_balance_exec(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
