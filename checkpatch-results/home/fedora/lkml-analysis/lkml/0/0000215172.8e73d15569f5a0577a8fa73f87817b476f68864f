WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'resposne' may be misspelled - perhaps 'response'?
#34: 
no resposne.  Maybe someone else will pick it up.
   ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#46: 
Signed-Off-By: Jim Radford <radford@blackbean.org>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#87: FILE: drivers/acpi/ibm_acpi.c:1216:
+			char arg_with_comma[32];
+			if (strlen(ibms[i].param) > sizeof(arg_with_comma)-2)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
