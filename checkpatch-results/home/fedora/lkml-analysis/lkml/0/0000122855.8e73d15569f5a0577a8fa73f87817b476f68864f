CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ctx->elements"
#50: FILE: drivers/s390/net/qeth_eddp.c:65:
+	if (ctx->elements != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#63: FILE: drivers/s390/net/qeth_main.c:521:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
