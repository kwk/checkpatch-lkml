WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#166: FILE: drivers/input/evdev.c:244:
+static ssize_t evdev_write(struct file * file, const char __user * buffer, size_t count, loff_t *ppos)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#166: FILE: drivers/input/evdev.c:244:
+static ssize_t evdev_write(struct file * file, const char __user * buffer, size_t count, loff_t *ppos)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#222: FILE: drivers/input/evdev.c:285:
+	while (list->head != list->tail && retval + evdev_event_size() <= count) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
