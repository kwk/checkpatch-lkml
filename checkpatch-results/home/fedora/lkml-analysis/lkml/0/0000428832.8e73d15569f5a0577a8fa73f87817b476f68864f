Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#918: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:956:
+   callers must hold sig->siglock.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#1368: FILE: kernel/signal.c:859:
+	if (!spin_is_locked(&p->sig->siglock))

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/locking/lockdep-design.html#annotations

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'signals_init', this function's name, in a string
#1617: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1853:
+		panic("signals_init(): cannot create sigqueue SLAB cache");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.

NOTE: Whitespace errors detected.
      You may wish to use scripts/cleanpatch or scripts/cleanfile

NOTE: If any of the errors are false positives, please report
      them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
