Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#43: 
--- a/include/linux/ptrace.h	Thu Feb  6 16:57:36 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
