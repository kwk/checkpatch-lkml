#30: 
> > this when migrating tasks from offline processors onto other online ones

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#47: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2257:
+/* Move (not current) task off this cpu, onto dest cpu.  Reference to
+   task must be held. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!t->mm"
#95: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2305:
+		if (t->mm == NULL && t->cpus_allowed != ~0UL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#132: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2342:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
