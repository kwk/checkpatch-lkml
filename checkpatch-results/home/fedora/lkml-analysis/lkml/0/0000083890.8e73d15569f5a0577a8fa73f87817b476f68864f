ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#67: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/eeh_event.c:129:
+	if (!mem_init_done)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
