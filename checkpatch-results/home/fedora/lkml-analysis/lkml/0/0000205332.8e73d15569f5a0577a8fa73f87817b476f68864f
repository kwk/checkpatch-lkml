CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#79: FILE: drivers/scsi/ahci.c:460:
+	void *mmio = (void *) ap->ioaddr.cmd_addr;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#116: FILE: drivers/scsi/libata-core.c:433:
+	if (ap->flags & ATA_FLAG_MMIO) {
+		return readb((void __iomem *) ap->ioaddr.error_addr);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#168: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:408:
+extern u8 ata_altstatus(struct ata_port *ap);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
