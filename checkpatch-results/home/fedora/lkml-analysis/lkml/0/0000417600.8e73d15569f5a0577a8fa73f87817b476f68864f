ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

+static const char version[] __initdata = "znet.c:v1.02 9/23/94 becker@scyld.com\n";

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+				 * but it seems to work. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
