#47: 
The attached patch blacklists all modules having "Linuxant" or "Conexant"
                                                                ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#82: FILE: kernel/module.c:1119:
+	/* LinuxAnt is known to ship non-GPL modules with license=="GPL"
+	   to cheat on our checks. Stop them from doing that. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
