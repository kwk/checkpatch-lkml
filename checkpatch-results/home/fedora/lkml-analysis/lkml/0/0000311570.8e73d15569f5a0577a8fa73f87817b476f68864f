ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#39: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/entry.S:1054:
+^I.long sys_ufuqueue_wait        $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#46: FILE: include/asm-i386/fulock.h:1:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#62: FILE: include/asm-i386/fulock.h:17:
+     * currently owns the fulock. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#72: FILE: include/asm-i386/fulock.h:27:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
