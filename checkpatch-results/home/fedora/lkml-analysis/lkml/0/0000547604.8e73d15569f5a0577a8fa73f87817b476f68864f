ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#33: FILE: ncr53c8xx.c:3542:
+	switch (np->scsi_mode) {

[...]

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }
