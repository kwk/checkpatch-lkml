CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#173: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1118:
+extern unsigned long ide_get_or_set_dma_base (ide_hwif_t *hwif, int extra, const char *name) __init;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
