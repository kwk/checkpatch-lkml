Sorry about the long Cc: list, but I wanted to make sure I included everyone

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open brace '{'
#81: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:537:
+		if (n == 0){

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'aio->bitmap != NULL'
#86: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:541:
+			if ((aio->bitmap != NULL) &&
 			   (atomic_dec_and_test(&aio->bitmap->count))){

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "aio->bitmap"
#86: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:541:
+			if ((aio->bitmap != NULL) &&

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#87: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:542:
+			if ((aio->bitmap != NULL) &&
 			   (atomic_dec_and_test(&aio->bitmap->count))){
