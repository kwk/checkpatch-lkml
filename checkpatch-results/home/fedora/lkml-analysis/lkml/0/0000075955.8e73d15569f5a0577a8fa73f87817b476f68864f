WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 130 exceeds 100 columns
#62: FILE: fs/nfs/direct.c:355:
+static int nfs_direct_read_schedule_iovec(struct nfs_direct_req *dreq, const struct iovec *iov, unsigned long nr_segs, loff_t pos)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
