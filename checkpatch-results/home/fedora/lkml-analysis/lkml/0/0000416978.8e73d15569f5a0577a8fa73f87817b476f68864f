(sharable with all similar network device drivers) rather than allow
 ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#121: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:109:
 	if (dev->bus->match(dev,drv)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#122: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:110:
+		if (drv->drvdata_size > 0) {
[...]
+		else
[...]

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#130: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:118:
+		}
+		else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#158: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:626:
+extern void netdev_kfree_priv(struct net_device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
