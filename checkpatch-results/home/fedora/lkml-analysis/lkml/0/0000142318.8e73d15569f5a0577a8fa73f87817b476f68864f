#47: 
By strange coincidence I was working on a patch to do this. Here's what I have 

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:59:
+extern void set_workqueue_nice(struct workqueue_struct *wq, long nice);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#94: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:398:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
