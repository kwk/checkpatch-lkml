#30: 
    Fix all the places where cpu key is attempted to be printed as ondisk key

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'assotiated' may be misspelled - perhaps 'associated'?
#48: 
    stale, but inodes assotiated with them are still valid and present in cache,    hence there is no way to deal with files, these handles are attached to.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 126 exceeds 100 columns

+		reiserfs_panic(p_s_sb, "PAP-5580: reiserfs_cut_from_item: item to convert does not exist (%K)", p_s_item_key);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
