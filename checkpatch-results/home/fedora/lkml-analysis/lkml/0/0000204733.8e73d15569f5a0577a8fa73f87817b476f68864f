CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#63: FILE: drivers/i2c/i2c-core.c:1259:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#90: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:101:
+extern s32 i2c_smbus_read_block_data(struct i2c_client * client,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:101:
+extern s32 i2c_smbus_read_block_data(struct i2c_client * client,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
