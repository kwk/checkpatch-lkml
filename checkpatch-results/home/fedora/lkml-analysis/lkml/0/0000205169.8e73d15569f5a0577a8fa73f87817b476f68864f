WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#16: 
Subject: [PATCH] A few more sparse fixes

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#74: FILE: drivers/char/drm/radeon_state.c:1845:
+				s->filp = NULL;
 				   ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#110: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_early.c:167:
+		device->baud = simple_strtoul(options, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#122: FILE: fs/reiserfs/namei.c:611:
+    retval = reiserfs_new_inode (&th, dir, mode, NULL, 0/*i_size*/, dentry, inode);$

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#122: FILE: fs/reiserfs/namei.c:611:
+    retval = reiserfs_new_inode (&th, dir, mode, NULL, 0/*i_size*/, dentry, inode);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
