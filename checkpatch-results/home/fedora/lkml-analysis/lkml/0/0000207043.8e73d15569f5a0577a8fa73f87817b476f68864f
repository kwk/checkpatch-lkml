CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#56: FILE: drivers/usb/core/hcd.h:226:
+extern int usb_hcd_pci_suspend (struct pci_dev *dev, pm_message_t state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
