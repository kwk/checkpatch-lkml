WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#31: FILE: arch/i386/pci/visws.c:20:
+extern struct pci_raw_ops pci_direct_conf1;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pci_raw_ops should normally be const
#31: FILE: arch/i386/pci/visws.c:20:
+extern struct pci_raw_ops pci_direct_conf1;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
