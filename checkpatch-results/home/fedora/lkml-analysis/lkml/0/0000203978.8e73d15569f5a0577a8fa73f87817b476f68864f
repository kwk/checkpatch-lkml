CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#78: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:1066:
+	if (low < max_dma)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#91: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:1079:
+extern void zone_sizes_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
