CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#33: FILE: fs/ext2/ext2_fs.h:599:
+extern struct inode *ext2_alloc_inode (struct super_block *sb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#91: FILE: fs/ext2/inode.c:40:
+extern void inode_init_once(void *, kmem_cache_t *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
