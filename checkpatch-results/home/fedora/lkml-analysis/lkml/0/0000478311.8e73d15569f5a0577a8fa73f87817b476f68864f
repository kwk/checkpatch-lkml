WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#58: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2773:
+	int res = nr_sectors * 512;
+	if (!test_bit(BIO_UPTODATE, &bio->bi_flags))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#66: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2780:
+int brw_kvec_async(int rw, kvec_cb_t cb, kdev_t dev, unsigned blocks, sector_t blknr, int sector_shift)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
