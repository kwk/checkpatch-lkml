Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#89: FILE: drivers/scsi/dc395x.c:1026:
+			u32 seglen = (u32)sg_dma_len(sl + i);
+			sgp[i].address = (u32)sg_dma_address(sl + i);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'transfered' may be misspelled - perhaps 'transferred'?
#131: FILE: drivers/scsi/dc395x.c:2143:
+		 * calculate all the residue data that not yet transfered
 		                                               ^^^^^^^^^^

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <ScsiInqData>
#157: FILE: drivers/scsi/dc395x.c:3319:
+		ptr = (struct ScsiInqData *)(srb->virt_map[0] + sg->offset);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#192: FILE: drivers/scsi/dc395x.c:4299:
+	virt_array = vmalloc((DC395x_MAX_SRB_CNT + 1) * DC395x_MAX_SG_LISTENTRY * sizeof(void*));

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
