atleast one more issue that needs to be resolved:
^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#128: 
Signed-Off-By: Shailabh Nagar <nagar@watson.ibm.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#259: FILE: kernel/taskstats.c:122:
+		struct listener *s = list_entry(p, struct listener, list);
+		ret = genlmsg_unicast(skb, s->pid);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*s)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct listener)...)
#301: FILE: kernel/taskstats.c:266:
+			s = kmalloc(sizeof(struct listener), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
