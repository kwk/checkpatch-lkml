ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#89: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:370:
+static struct device * next_device(struct klist_iter * i)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
