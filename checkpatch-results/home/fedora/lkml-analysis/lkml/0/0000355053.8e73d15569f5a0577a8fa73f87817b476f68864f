ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#27: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:2224:
+static int drivers_run = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#35: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:2232:
+	if(drivers_run)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#35: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:2232:
+	if(drivers_run)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
