Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#59: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c:6007:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(mpt_poll_interrupt);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.h:1078:
+extern void	 mpt_poll_interrupt(MPT_ADAPTER *ioc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros starting with if should be enclosed by a do - while loop to avoid possible if/else logic defects
#83: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.h:1099:

+	if (crashdump_mode()) 			\
+		spin_lock(host_lock);		\
+	else					\
+		spin_lock_irq(host_lock);

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'host_lock' - possible side-effects?
#83: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.h:1099:
+#define MPT_HOST_LOCK(host_lock)		\
+	if (crashdump_mode()) 			\
+		spin_lock(host_lock);		\
+	else					\
+		spin_lock_irq(host_lock);

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#83: FILE: drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.h:1099:
+#define MPT_HOST_LOCK(host_lock)		\
+	if (crashdump_mode()) 			\
+		spin_lock(host_lock);		\
+	else					\
+		spin_lock_irq(host_lock);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
