CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#141: FILE: include/linux/time.h:145:
+extern unsigned long long timestamp_clock(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __weak over __attribute__((weak))
#177: FILE: kernel/time.c:644:
+__attribute__((weak)) unsigned long long timestamp_clock(void)
