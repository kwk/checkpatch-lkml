CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#64: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1112:
+extern int __kill_tref_info(int sig, struct siginfo *info, struct task_ref *ref);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+		success |= !err;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
