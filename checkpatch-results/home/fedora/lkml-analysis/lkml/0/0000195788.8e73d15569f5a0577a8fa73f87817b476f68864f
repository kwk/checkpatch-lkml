#31: 
o alloc_remap takes a node_id where we might expect a pgdat which was intended

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#171: FILE: arch/i386/mm/discontig.c:369:
+		free_area_init_node(nid, NODE_DATA(nid), zones_size, start,
+				zholes_size);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#183: FILE: include/linux/bootmem.h:71:
+extern void *alloc_remap(int nid, unsigned long size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
