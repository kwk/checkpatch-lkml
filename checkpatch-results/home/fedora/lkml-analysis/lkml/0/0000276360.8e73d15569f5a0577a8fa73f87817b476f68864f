CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#96: FILE: fs/ntfs/super.c:320:
+	ntfs_debug("Entering, old flags = 0x%x, new flags = 0x%x.",
+			vol->vol_flags, flags);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#99: FILE: fs/ntfs/super.c:323:
+	BUG_ON(!ni);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#114: FILE: fs/ntfs/super.c:338:
+	vi = (VOLUME_INFORMATION*)((u8*)ctx->attr +

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#114: FILE: fs/ntfs/super.c:338:
+	vi = (VOLUME_INFORMATION*)((u8*)ctx->attr +

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#116: FILE: fs/ntfs/super.c:340:
+	vol->vol_flags = vi->flags = flags;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
