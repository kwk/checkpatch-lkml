CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:98:
+extern void *kcalloc(size_t, size_t, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#77: FILE: mm/slab.c:2353:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(kcalloc);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
