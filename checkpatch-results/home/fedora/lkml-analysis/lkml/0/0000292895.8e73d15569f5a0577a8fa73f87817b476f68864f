#51: 
There are two places in i2c-core where drivers are informed of new adapters.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'commment' may be misspelled - perhaps 'comment'?
#72: 
can any of the i2c experts commment on this?

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#113: FILE: drivers/i2c/i2c-core.c:264:
+						 "driver '%s' not probed.\n",adap->name,driver->name);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
