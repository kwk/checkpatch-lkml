+static inline void expand(struct zone *zone, struct page *page,
  	int low, int high, struct free_area *area)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#76: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:526:
+		struct page *page = __rmqueue(zone, order);
+		if (unlikely(page == NULL))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!page"
#76: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:526:
+		if (unlikely(page == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
