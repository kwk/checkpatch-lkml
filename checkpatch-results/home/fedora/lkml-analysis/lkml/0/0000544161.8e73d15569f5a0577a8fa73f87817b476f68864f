ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#69: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:34:
+int using_apic_timer = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
