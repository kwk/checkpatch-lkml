CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "tape->next_stage"
#297: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:1759:
+		if (tape->next_stage != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#428: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:2406:
+	pc->request_transfer = pc->buffer_size = length * tape->tape_block_size;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#1811: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:4092:
+			return idetape_position_tape(drive, mt_count * tape->user_bs_factor, tape->partition, 0);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#1853: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:4177:
+			if (tape->drv_write_prot) {
 				mtget.mt_gstat |= GMT_WR_PROT(0xffffffff);
 			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
