#22: 
The following patch adds support for ethtool to the ewrk3 driver. It is against

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#109: FILE: drivers/net/ewrk3.c:1635:
+	struct ewrk3_private *lp = (struct ewrk3_private *) dev->priv;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#117: FILE: drivers/net/ewrk3.c:1643:
+	switch (ethcmd) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Read_EEPROM>
#121: FILE: drivers/net/ewrk3.c:1647:
+		int fwrev = Read_EEPROM(dev->base_addr, EEPROM_REVLVL);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#153: FILE: drivers/net/ewrk3.c:1679:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

may be added while invoking checkpatch.
