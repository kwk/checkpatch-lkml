CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:176:
+extern void check_host_supports_tls(int *supports_tls, int *tls_min);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#103: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#108: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/sys-i386/tls.c:1:
+#include <linux/unistd.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+ * i386 host have it == 6; x86_64 host have it == 12, for i386 emulation. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

#117: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/sys-i386/tls.c:10:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#264: FILE: arch/um/sys-i386/tls.c:378:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
