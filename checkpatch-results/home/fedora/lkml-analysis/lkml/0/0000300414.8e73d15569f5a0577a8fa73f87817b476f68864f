CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dev->coherent_dma_mask < 0xffffffff'
#64: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-dma.c:23:
+	if (dev == NULL || (dev->coherent_dma_mask < 0xffffffff))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev"
#64: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-dma.c:23:
+	if (dev == NULL || (dev->coherent_dma_mask < 0xffffffff))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#86: FILE: arch/ia64/hp/common/sba_iommu.c:1064:
+^I^I           dev->coherent_dma_mask, *dma_handle);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#142: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-gart.c:180:
+^I^Idma_mask = hwdev->dev.coherent_dma_mask; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
