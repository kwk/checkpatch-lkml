The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#223: FILE: include/asm-s390/ctrlchar.h:12:
+extern unsigned int ctrlchar_handle(const unsigned char *buf, int len,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#228: FILE: include/asm-s390/ctrlchar.h:17:
+#define CTRLCHAR_NONE  (1 << 8)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
