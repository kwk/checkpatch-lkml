#26: 
I needed the ide-subsytem as a module on 2.4.23 and noticed (due to the missing modprobe on the embedded linux system)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'get's' may be misspelled - perhaps 'gets'?
#28: 
The patch also get's rid of the need for ide-probe-mini alias ide-detect, but I don't know if that is desired? (it was in my case).

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+       if (ide_probe) {
                (void) ide_probe->init();
        }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - int ideprobe_init_module() should probably be int ideprobe_init_module(void)
#71: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:3042:

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#71: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:3042:
+extern int ideprobe_init_module();

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
