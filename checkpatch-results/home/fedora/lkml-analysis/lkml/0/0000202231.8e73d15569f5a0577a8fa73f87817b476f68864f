WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#414: FILE: include/media/saa7146.h:160:
+int saa7146_i2c_transfer(struct saa7146_dev *saa, const struct i2c_msg *msgs, int num,  int retries);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

#440: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:58:
+extern int i2c_transfer(struct i2c_adapter *adap, struct i2c_msg *msgs, int num);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.

  char *linux_banner;
