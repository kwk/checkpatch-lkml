Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#173: FILE: include/linux/binfmts.h:77:
+extern int setup_arg_pages(struct linux_binprm * bprm,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#173: FILE: include/linux/binfmts.h:77:
+extern int setup_arg_pages(struct linux_binprm * bprm,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
