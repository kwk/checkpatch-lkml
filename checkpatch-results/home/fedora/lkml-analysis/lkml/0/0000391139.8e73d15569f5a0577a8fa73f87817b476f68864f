                     \-[02]--+-00.0  MOBILITY Electronics: Unknown device 0121

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#127: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug.c:313:
+		BUG_ON(!list_empty(&b->children));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#171: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug.c:356:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(pci_remove_all_bus_devices);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_dev *' should also have an identifier name
#180: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:648:
+void pci_remove_bus_device(struct pci_dev *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_bus *' should also have an identifier name
#181: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:649:
+void pci_remove_all_bus_devices(struct pci_bus *);
