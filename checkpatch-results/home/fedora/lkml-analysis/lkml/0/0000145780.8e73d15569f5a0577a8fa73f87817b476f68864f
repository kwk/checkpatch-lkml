WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#161: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:2:
+ * linux/kernel/power/snapshot.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#291: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:199:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#561: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:364:
+	if (!(pgdir = alloc_pagedir(pages))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#590: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:412:
+	pagedir_save = pagedir_nosave = swsusp_alloc(nr_copy_pages);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
