ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#37: 
--- a/arch/ppc64/kernel/chrp_setup.c	Mon Jun 14 08:07:11 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_SPINLOCK_TIMEOUT' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#84: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/spinlock.h:283:
+#define ARCH_HAS_SPINLOCK_TIMEOUT

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.
