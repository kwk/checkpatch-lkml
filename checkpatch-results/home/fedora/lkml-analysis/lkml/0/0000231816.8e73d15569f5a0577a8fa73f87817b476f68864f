WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#32: 
#define snd_pmac_keywest_write(i2c,cmd,len,data) i2c_smbus_write_block_data((i2c)->client, cmd, len, data)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
