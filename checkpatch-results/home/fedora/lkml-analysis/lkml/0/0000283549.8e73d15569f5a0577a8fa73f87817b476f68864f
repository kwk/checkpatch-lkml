#28: 
  Here is a patch to change the way ptses are allocated.  It applies against

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#53: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1369:
+		 * larger pts numbers */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#54: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1370:
+		for (index = 0; index < MAX_PREFERRED_PTY && driver->refcount < pty_limit; index++) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#78: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:38:
+#define MAX_PREFERRED_PTY	256			/* we prefer to allocate ptys beneath this number */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
