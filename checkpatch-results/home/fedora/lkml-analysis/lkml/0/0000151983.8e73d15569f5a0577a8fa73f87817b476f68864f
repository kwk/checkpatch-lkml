#26: 
This patch against 2.6.13-mm3 replaces malloc and memset with kzalloc in drivers/base/class.c .

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'swaped' may be misspelled - perhaps 'swapped'?
#28: 
  The memset arguments were occasionally swaped and therefore wrong.
                                         ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*cls)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct class)...)
#43: FILE: drivers/base/class.c:193:
+	cls = kzalloc(sizeof(struct class), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
