WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#72: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1773:
+	int nid;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#84: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1785:
+		/* we have to stop all cpus to guaranntee there is no user
+		   of zonelist */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
