CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#38: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:419:
+		(void) kmem_cache_reap(gfp_mask);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:115:
+extern void refill_inactive(int nr_pages);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
