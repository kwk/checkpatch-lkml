Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

For example, the integer 00101, will go r,l,r,l,l until an empty slot if found.

In order to remove a node, any node can can replace the node

################################################

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#132: FILE: linux-2.4.20/include/linux/sched.h:545:
+	p->pidhash_next = p->pidhash_prev = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#134: FILE: linux-2.4.20/include/linux/sched.h:547:
+	if (!(n = pid_tree)) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#141: FILE: linux-2.4.20/include/linux/sched.h:554:
+			if (n->pidhash_next) n = n->pidhash_next;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#141: FILE: linux-2.4.20/include/linux/sched.h:554:

+		else
[...]
+			else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
