Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#120: FILE: include/linux/timer.h:99:
+extern int it_real_fn(void *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#120: FILE: include/linux/timer.h:99:
+extern int it_real_fn(void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#132: FILE: kernel/exit.c:845:
+ ^I^Ihrtimer_cancel(&tsk->signal->real_timer);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#132: FILE: kernel/exit.c:845:
+ ^I^Ihrtimer_cancel(&tsk->signal->real_timer);$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#132: FILE: kernel/exit.c:845:
+ ^I^Ihrtimer_cancel(&tsk->signal->real_timer);$

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#193: FILE: kernel/itimer.c:36:
+	if (hrtimer_active(timer)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#234: FILE: kernel/itimer.c:131:

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#256: FILE: kernel/itimer.c:137:
+		hrtimer_forward(&tsk->signal->real_timer,
+			       tsk->signal->it_real_incr);

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#297: FILE: kernel/itimer.c:158:
+			ovalue->it_interval
+				= ktime_to_timeval(tsk->signal->it_real_incr);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
