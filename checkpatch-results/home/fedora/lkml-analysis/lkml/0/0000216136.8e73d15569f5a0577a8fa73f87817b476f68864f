ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#88: FILE: drivers/connector/connector.c:49:
+int cn_already_initialized = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#148: FILE: lib/kobject_uevent.c:64:
+static void kobject_uevent_send_connector(const char *signal, const char *obj, char **envp, int gfp_mask)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
