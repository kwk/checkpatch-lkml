==> Regarding Re: [patch,rfc] allow registration of multiple netpolls per interface; Matt Mackall <mpm@selenic.com> adds:

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#233: FILE: net/core/netpoll.c:259:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#300: FILE: net/core/netpoll.c:646:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
