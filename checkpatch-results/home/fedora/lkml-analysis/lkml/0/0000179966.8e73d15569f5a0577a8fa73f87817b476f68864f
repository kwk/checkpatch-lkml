CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'field' may be better as '(field)' to avoid precedence issues

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ECT' may be misspelled - perhaps 'ETC'?
#188: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:198:

 		                       ^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#190: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:200:
+		 * but Linux follows this rule. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
