#38: 
#echo "max_iters=100"  > /proc/ipi -- set number of iterations

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#57: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/genapic_flat.c:22:
+#include <asm/uaccess.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::
