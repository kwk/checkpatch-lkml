ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#61: 
--- a/drivers/serial/8250_acpi.c	Fri Jan 16 22:06:23 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*priv)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct serial_private)...)
#106: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_acpi.c:113:
+	priv = kmalloc(sizeof(struct serial_private), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#123: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_acpi.c:127:
+	if (serial_req.iomem_base)
[...]
+	else if (!serial_req.port) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#145: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_acpi.c:142:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "Couldn't register serial port %s: %d\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#146: FILE: drivers/serial/8250_acpi.c:143:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "Couldn't register serial port %s: %d\n",
+			device->pnp.bus_id, priv->line);

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#197: FILE: drivers/serial/Kconfig:65:
+config SERIAL_8250_HCDP

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
