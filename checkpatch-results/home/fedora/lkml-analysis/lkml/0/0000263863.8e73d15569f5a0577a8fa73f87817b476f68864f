WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'conroller' may be misspelled - perhaps 'controller'?
#26: 
Here's an update to the Altix system conroller communication driver.
                                     ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#239: FILE: drivers/char/snsc.c:36:
+	struct subch_data_s *sd = (struct subch_data_s *) subch_data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#253: FILE: drivers/char/snsc.c:45:
+		if (status & SAL_IROUTER_INTR_RECV) {
+			wake_up_all(&sd->sd_rq);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#406: FILE: drivers/char/snsc.c:342:
+static struct file_operations scdrv_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

#474: FILE: drivers/char/snsc.c:396:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
