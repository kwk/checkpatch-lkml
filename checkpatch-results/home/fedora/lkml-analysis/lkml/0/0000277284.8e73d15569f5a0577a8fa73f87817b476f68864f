WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#305: FILE: ipc/util.c:381:
+		if (!can_do_mlock())  {
+			return -1;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#308: FILE: ipc/util.c:384:
+^I}^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#349: FILE: mm/mmap.c:529:
+		unsigned long locked, lock_limit;
+		locked = mm->locked_vm << PAGE_SHIFT;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'locked > lock_limit'
#411: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1178:
+		if ((locked > lock_limit) && !capable(CAP_IPC_LOCK))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
