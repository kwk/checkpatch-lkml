ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#455: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:1139:
+		if (ide_dma_on(drive)) return -EIO;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#478: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1107:
+	void		(*protocol_changed)(ide_drive_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#491: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1319:
+extern void ide_protocol_changed(ide_drive_t *drive);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
