CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'bdev_info_list[index]->device == device'
#45: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:122:

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*this)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct bdev_opened)...)
#64: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:141:
+	this = kmalloc(sizeof(struct bdev_opened), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#65: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:142:
+	BUG_ON(!this);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
