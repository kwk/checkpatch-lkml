CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#48: FILE: drivers/scsi/st.c:881:
+	STp->rew_at_close = STp->autorew_dev = (minor(inode->i_rdev) & 0x80) == 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <STp>
#48: FILE: drivers/scsi/st.c:881:
+	STp->rew_at_close = STp->autorew_dev = (minor(inode->i_rdev) & 0x80) == 0;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
