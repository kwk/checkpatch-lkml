ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#59: FILE: drivers/block/rd.c:194:
+static int ramdisk_readpage(struct file *file, struct page * page)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct address_space_operations should normally be const
#100: FILE: drivers/block/rd.c:235:
+struct address_space_operations ramdisk_aops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
