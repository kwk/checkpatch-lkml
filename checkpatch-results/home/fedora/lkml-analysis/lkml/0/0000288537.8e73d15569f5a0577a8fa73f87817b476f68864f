#27: 
[PATCH] I2C: minor bugfixes for the pcf8591.c driver and formatting cleanups.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#43: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/pcf8591.c:128:
+	if ((value = (simple_strtoul(buf, NULL, 10) + 5) / 10) <= 255) {

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
