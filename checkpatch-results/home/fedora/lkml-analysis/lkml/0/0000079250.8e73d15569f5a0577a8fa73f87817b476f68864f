CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#56: FILE: arch/i386/mm/discontig.c:312:
+	system_max_low_pfn = max_low_pfn = zone_boundry_align_pfn(max_low_pfn);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
