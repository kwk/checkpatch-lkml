WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#77: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/pgtable.h:108:
+static inline pte_t ptep_get_and_clear_full(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long addr, pte_t *ptep, int full)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
