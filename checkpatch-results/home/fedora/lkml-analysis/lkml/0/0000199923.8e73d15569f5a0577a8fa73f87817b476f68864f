CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#191: FILE: drivers/serial/jsm/jsm_driver.c:99:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46

limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
