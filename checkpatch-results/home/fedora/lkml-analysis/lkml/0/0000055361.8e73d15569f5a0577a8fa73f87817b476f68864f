WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'frambuffer' may be misspelled - perhaps 'framebuffer'?
#41: 
Allow an advanced user to specify a frambuffer size, rather then probing
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#63: FILE: drivers/video/geode/Kconfig:26:
+config FB_GEODE_GX_SET_FBSIZE
+	bool "Manually specify the Geode GX framebuffer size"
+	depends on FB_GEODE_GX
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  If you want to manually specify the size of your GX framebuffer,
+	  say Y here, otherwise say N to dynamically probe it.
+	  
+	  Say N unless you know what you are doing.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#70: FILE: drivers/video/geode/Kconfig:33:
+^I  $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#95: FILE: drivers/video/geode/display_gx.c:25:
+unsigned int gx_frame_buffer_size(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#114: FILE: drivers/video/geode/display_gx.c:99:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#137: FILE: drivers/video/geode/gxfb_core.c:244:
+	 * in the display controller */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
