WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#67: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:691:
+			u8 progif;
+			pci_read_config_byte(dev, PCI_CLASS_PROG, &progif);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#158: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:863:
+DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_EARLY(PCI_VENDOR_ID_SERVERWORKS, PCI_DEVICE_ID_SERVERWORKS_CSB5IDE, quirk_svwks_csb5ide );

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
