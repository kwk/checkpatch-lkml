CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#347: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/ptrace.h:73:
+extern unsigned long profile_pc(struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <xSharedProc>
#409: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/spinlock.h:56:
+#define SHARED_PROCESSOR (get_paca()->lppaca.xSharedProc)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#452: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/spinlock.h:89:
+static int __inline__ _raw_spin_trylock(spinlock_t *lock)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
