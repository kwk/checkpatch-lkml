WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#34: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/head.S:2:
+ *  linux/arch/i386/kernel/head.S -- the 32-bit startup code.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
