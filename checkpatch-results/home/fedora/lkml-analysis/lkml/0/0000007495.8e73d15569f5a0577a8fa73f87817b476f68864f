CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#88: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:322:

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#135: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:384:
+extern fastcall void tasklet_enable(struct tasklet_struct *t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#148: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:466:
+static void inline

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "t->next"
#152: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:470:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
