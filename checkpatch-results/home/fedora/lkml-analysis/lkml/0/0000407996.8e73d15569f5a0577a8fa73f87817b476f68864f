ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#86: FILE: drivers/char/agp/backend.c:283:
+int __init agp_init(void) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#86: FILE: drivers/char/agp/backend.c:283:
+int __init agp_init(void) 

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#88: FILE: drivers/char/agp/backend.c:285:
+	static int agp_has_init = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
