WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#63: FILE: fs/namespace.c:1735:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(init_namespace);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/linux/namespace.h:19:
+extern void init_namespace(struct namespace *, struct vfsmount *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct namespace *' should also have an identifier name
#91: FILE: include/linux/namespace.h:19:
+extern void init_namespace(struct namespace *, struct vfsmount *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct vfsmount *' should also have an identifier name
#91: FILE: include/linux/namespace.h:19:
+extern void init_namespace(struct namespace *, struct vfsmount *);
