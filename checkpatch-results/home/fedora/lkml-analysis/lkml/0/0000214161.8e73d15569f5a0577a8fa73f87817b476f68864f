ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#77: FILE: arch/x86_64/Kconfig:371:
+          $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#146: FILE: arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/misc.c:311:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#146: FILE: arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/misc.c:311:
+	if ( (__PHYSICAL_START + low_buffer_size) > ((ulg)high_buffer_start)) {
[...]
 	else mv->hcount = -1;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 130 exceeds 100 columns
#188: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/head.S:327:
+	.quad	0x0000000000005007 + __PHYSICAL_START	/* -> level2_kernel_pgt (so that __va works even before pagetable_init) */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
