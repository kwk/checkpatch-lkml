Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#65: 
--- a/shortlog	Sat Dec  6 17:40:59 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
