ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#38: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:249:
+void line_set_termios(struct tty_struct *tty, struct ktermios * old)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#51: FILE: arch/um/include/line.h:79:
+extern void line_set_termios(struct tty_struct *tty, struct ktermios * old);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
