ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+extern int setup_early_printk(char *); $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#104: FILE: include/asm-i386/arch_hooks.h:27:
+extern int setup_early_printk(char *); 

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char *' should also have an identifier name
#104: FILE: include/asm-i386/arch_hooks.h:27:
+extern int setup_early_printk(char *); 

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
