Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'call_rcu_bh', prefer 'call_rcu' instead
#114: FILE: net/ipv4/route.c:703:
+			call_rcu_bh(&rth->u.dst.rcu_head, rt_list_free);

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.
