Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#158: FILE: init/Kconfig:90:
+config SWAP_PREFETCH
+	bool "Support for prefetching swapped memory"
+	depends on SWAP && EXPERIMENTAL
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  This option will allow the kernel to prefetch swapped memory pages
+	  when idle. The pages will be kept on both swap and in swap_cache
+	  thus avoiding the need for further I/O if either ram or swap space
+	  is required.
+	  
+	  What this will do on workstations is slowly bring back applications
+	  that have swapped out after memory intensive workloads back into
+	  physical ram if you have free ram at a later stage and the machine
+	  is relatively idle. This means that when you come back to your
+	  computer after leaving it idle for a while, applications will come
+	  to life faster. Note that your swap usage will appear to increase
+	  but these are cached pages, can be dropped freely by the vm, and it
+	  should stabilise around 50% swap usage.
+	  
+	  Desktop users will most likely want to say Y.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#261: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:2:
+ * linux/mm/swap_prefetch.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'prepare_prefetch', this function's name, in a string
#317: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:58:
+		panic("prepare_prefetch(): cannot create swapped_entry SLAB cache");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#365: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:106:

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#379: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:120:
+	if (likely(!error)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#427: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:168:
+static struct page * prefetch_get_page(void)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!zone"
#460: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:201:
+	if (zone == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#602: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:343:

Do not use assignments in if condition.

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
