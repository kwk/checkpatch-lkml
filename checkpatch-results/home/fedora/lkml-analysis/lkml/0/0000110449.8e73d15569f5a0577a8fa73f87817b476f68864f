It's not a big deal deal but since it is easy to track

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'proceses' may be misspelled - perhaps 'processes'?

the proceses we might as well.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#66: FILE: fs/fcntl.c:254:
 {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#69: FILE: fs/fcntl.c:257:
+	int who = pid;
+	type = PIDTYPE_PID;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
