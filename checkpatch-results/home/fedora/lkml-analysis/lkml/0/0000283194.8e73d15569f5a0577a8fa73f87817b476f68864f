WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#51: FILE: drivers/usb/core/config.c:90:
+static int usb_parse_interface(struct usb_host_config *config, unsigned char *buffer, int size, int inums[])

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
