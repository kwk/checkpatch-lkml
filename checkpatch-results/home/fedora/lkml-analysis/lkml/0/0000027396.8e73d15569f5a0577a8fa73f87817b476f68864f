WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config DLPC104_WATCHDOG
+	tristate "Digital-Logic MSM-P5XEN PC104 unit Watchdog"
+	depends on WATCHDOG && X86
+	---help---
+	  This is the driver for the built-in watchdog timer on the MSM-P5XEN
+	  PC104 unit made by Digital-Logic. If you fail to refresh the watchdog
+	  at least every 600 msecs (writing a byte to the device), it will
+	  reboot your machine. The watchdog chip is a LTC1232 controlled by a
+	  single I/O port @ 0x1037.
+
+	  *Note*: This hardware watchdog is not probeable nor configurable.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called dlpc104.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
