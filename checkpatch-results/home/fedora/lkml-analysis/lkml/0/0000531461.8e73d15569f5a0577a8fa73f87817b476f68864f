WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#35: FILE: net/ipv4/ip_masq_vdolive.c:245:
+			IP_MASQ_DEBUG(1-debug, "VDOlive: loaded support on port[%d] = %d\n", i, ports[i]);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
