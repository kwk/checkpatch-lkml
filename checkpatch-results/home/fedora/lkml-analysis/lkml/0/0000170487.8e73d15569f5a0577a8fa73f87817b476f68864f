printks on other machines by only zapping the locks if the oops is happening

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#31: 
Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#41: FILE: kernel/printk.c:518:
+static volatile int printk_cpu = -1;

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#53: FILE: kernel/printk.c:530:
+		 * make sure we can't deadlock */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
