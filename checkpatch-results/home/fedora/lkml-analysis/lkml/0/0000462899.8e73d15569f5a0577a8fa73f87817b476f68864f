CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: linux/include/asm-i386/ide.h:78:
+	extern int ide_register_hw(hw_regs_t *hw, struct ata_channel **hwifp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
