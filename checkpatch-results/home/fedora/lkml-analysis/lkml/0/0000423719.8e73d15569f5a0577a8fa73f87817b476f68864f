CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: include/linux/netfilter_ipv4/ip_conntrack_core.h:20:
+extern struct ip_conntrack_protocol *__ip_ct_find_proto(u_int8_t protocol);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#71: FILE: include/linux/netfilter_ipv4/ip_conntrack_core.h:21:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

+struct ip_conntrack_protocol *__ip_ct_find_proto(u_int8_t protocol)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
