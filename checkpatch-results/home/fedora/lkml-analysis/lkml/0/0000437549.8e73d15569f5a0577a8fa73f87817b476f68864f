ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#49: FILE: drivers/atm/iphase.c:2006:
+	if (iadev->desc_tbl == NULL) return -EAGAIN;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!iadev->desc_tbl"
#49: FILE: drivers/atm/iphase.c:2006:
+	if (iadev->desc_tbl == NULL) return -EAGAIN;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
