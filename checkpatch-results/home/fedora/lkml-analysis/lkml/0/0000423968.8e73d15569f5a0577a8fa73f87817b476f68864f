+extern int scsi_set_medium_removal(Scsi_Device *dev, char state);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#36: FILE: copy/include/scsi/scsi_ioctl.h:42:
+extern int scsi_set_medium_removal(Scsi_Device *dev, char state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
