ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#98: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:853:
+	if (file->private_data != (void*)((long)current->self_exec_id))

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
