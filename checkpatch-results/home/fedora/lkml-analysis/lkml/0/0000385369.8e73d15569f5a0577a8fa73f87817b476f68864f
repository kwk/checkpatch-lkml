Subject: [PATCH] distributed counters for ext2 to avoid group scaning
                                                              ^^^^^^^

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#24: 
ext2 with concurrent balloc/ialloc doesn't maintain global free inodes/blocks counters.

#27: 
10G fs. I believe there is method to avoid scaning and decrease memory footprint. 
                                           ^^^^^^^

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#120: FILE: fs/ext2/super.c:38:
+unsigned long ext2_count_free_inodes_old(struct super_block *sb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#121: FILE: fs/ext2/super.c:39:
+unsigned long ext2_count_free_blocks_old (struct super_block * sb);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
