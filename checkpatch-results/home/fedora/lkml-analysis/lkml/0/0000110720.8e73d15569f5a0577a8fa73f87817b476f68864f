#34: 
This will be used by the next patch in the series to replace a mempool-backed

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#72: FILE: mm/mempool.c:306:
+	size_t size = (size_t) pool_data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#73: FILE: mm/mempool.c:307:
+	size_t size = (size_t) pool_data;
+	return kzalloc(size, gfp_mask);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
