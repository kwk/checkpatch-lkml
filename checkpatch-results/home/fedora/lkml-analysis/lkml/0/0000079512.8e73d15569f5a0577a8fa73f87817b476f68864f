CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: drivers/base/base.h:9:
+extern int hypervisor_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#74: FILE: drivers/base/base.h:11:
+#define hypervisor_init() do { } while(0)
