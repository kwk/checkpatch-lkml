Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#171: FILE: drivers/char/inotify.c:908:
+	ret = find_inode((const char __user*) request->dirname, &nd);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
