comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
