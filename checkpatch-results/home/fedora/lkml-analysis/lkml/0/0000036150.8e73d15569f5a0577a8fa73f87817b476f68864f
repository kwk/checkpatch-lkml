#26: 
The inode diet patch in -mm unhooked xfs_preferred_iosize from the stat call:

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#28: 
--- a/fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_vnode.c

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
