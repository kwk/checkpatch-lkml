WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

#57: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/kprobes.c:258:

  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#120: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/kprobes.c:345:
+	return (void*)orig_ret_address;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
