#26: 
Some of them duplicate the initializations already done by get_empty_inode()

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#153: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:37:
+	struct inode * inode = new_inode(sb);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#170: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:46:
+		/* inode->i_nlink is left 1 - arguably wrong for directories,
+		   but it's the best we can do without reading the directory

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
