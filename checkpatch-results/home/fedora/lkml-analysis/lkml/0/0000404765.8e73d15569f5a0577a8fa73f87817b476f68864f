  See usage description in the kbuild script located in the top-level kernel src directory.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#105: 
--- a/Makefile	Fri Dec 27 14:45:32 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
