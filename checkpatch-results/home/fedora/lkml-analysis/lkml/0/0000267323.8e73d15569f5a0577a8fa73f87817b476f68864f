ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#39: 
--- a/kernel/power/pmdisk.c	2004-07-17 14:51:52 -07:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#142: FILE: kernel/power/pmdisk.c:957:
+	if ((error = swsusp_pagedir_relocate()))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#153: FILE: kernel/power/power.h:22:
+extern int swsusp_pagedir_relocate(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#167: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:878:
+static int __init does_collide_order(suspend_pagedir_t *pagedir, unsigned long addr,
 		int order)
