WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+ * is needed for drives over 8 GB. RZ */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
