CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#123: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:372:
+	if (page != NULL && !PageActive(page) && !TestSetPageLocked(page)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "page"
#123: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:372:
+	if (page != NULL && !PageActive(page) && !TestSetPageLocked(page)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#138: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:387:

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#149: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:398:
+		BUG_ON(!PageLocked(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
