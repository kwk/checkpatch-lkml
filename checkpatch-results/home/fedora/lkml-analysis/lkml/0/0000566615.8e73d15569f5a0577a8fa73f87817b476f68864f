Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#96: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:81:
+extern unsigned volatile int global_irq_lock;

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#123: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:103:
+		printk("\n");

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#124: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:104:
+^I}^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#153: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:66:
+extern void bust_spinlocks(int yes);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#163: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:417:
+	static unsigned int	last_irq_sums [NR_CPUS],

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#164: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:418:

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#164: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:418:
