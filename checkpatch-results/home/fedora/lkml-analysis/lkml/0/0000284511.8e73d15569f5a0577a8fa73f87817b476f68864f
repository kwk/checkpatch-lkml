WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#117: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/smpboot.c:90:
+extern cpumask_t cpu_present_map;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinitdata is unnecessary
#183: FILE: include/asm-ia64/smp.h:39:
 extern char no_int_routing __devinitdata;

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#220: FILE: include/linux/cpumask.h:21:
+#define cpu_present(cpu) ^I^Icpu_isset((cpu), cpu_present_map)$

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#237: FILE: include/linux/cpumask.h:39:
+#define cpu_present(cpu)		({ BUG_ON((cpu) != 0); 1; })

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'cpu' - possible side-effects?
