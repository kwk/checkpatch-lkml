#31: 
here is a compatibility fix between Linux and Solaris when used with VxFS filesystems: Solaris

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#90: FILE: fs/nfs_common/nfsacl.c:55:
+	switch(entry->e_tag) {
+		case ACL_USER_OBJ:
[...]
+		case ACL_GROUP_OBJ:
[...]
+		case ACL_USER:
+		case ACL_GROUP:
[...]
+		default:  /* Solaris depends on that! */

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRWXO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0007'.
#106: FILE: fs/nfs_common/nfsacl.c:70:
+	*p++ = htonl(entry->e_perm & S_IRWXO);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#125: FILE: fs/nfs_common/nfsacl.c:102:
+		/* Insert entries in canonical order: other orders seem
+		 to confuse Solaris VxFS. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
