WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'line_config', this function's name, in a string
#65: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:566:
+		printk("line_config - can't configure all devices from "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#66: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:567:
+		printk("line_config - can't configure all devices from "
+		       "mconsole\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#125: FILE: arch/um/include/line.h:79:
+extern int line_setup(struct line *lines, unsigned int sizeof_lines,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
