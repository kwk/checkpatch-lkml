CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#513: FILE: drivers/mtd/devices/mtd_dataflash.c:402:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
