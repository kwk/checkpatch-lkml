#36: 
The signed characters in scripts are causing warnings with GCC 4 on systems with proper string functions (with char*, not signed char* as parameters). All signed strings were removed because they were all directly or indirectly used in string functions.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)

+typedef void FILELINE(char * file, char * line);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
