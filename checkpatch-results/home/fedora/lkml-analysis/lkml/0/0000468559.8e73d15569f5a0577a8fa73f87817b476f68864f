The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

#179: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:738:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#242: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:809:
+	highstart_pfn = highend_pfn = max_pfn;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#243: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:810:
+	if (max_pfn > max_low_pfn) {
+		highstart_pfn = max_low_pfn;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
