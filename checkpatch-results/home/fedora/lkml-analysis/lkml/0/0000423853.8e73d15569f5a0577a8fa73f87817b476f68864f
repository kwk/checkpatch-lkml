ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#57: 
--- a/include/net/ip_fib.h	Sun Oct 13 20:14:59 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: include/net/ip_fib.h:225:
+extern void fib_node_seq_show(struct seq_file *seq, int type, int dead,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#311: FILE: net/ipv4/fib_hash.c:774:
+  ^Ireturn 0;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#311: FILE: net/ipv4/fib_hash.c:774:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:NETWORKING_BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: networking block comments don't use an empty /* line, use /* Comment...

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#417: FILE: net/ipv4/ip_proc.c:191:
+	seq_printf(seq, "%-127s\n", "Iface\tDestination\tGateway "
+			"\tFlags\tRefCnt\tUse\tMetric\tMask\t\tMTU"

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#418: FILE: net/ipv4/ip_proc.c:192:

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#434: FILE: net/ipv4/ip_proc.c:208:
+struct seq_operations fib_seq_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#458: FILE: net/ipv4/ip_proc.c:232:
+static struct file_operations fib_seq_fops = {

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#475: FILE: net/ipv4/ip_proc.c:269:
+	p = create_proc_entry("route", S_IRUGO, proc_net);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
