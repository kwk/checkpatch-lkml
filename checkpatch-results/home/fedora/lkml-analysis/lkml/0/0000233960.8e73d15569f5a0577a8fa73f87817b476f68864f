#25: 
This patch fixes the return codes from sendmsg/recvmsg when a signal happens.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#39: FILE: include/net/dn_nsp.h:40:
+extern struct sk_buff *dn_alloc_send_skb(struct sock *sk, size_t *size, int noblock, long timeo, int *err);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#39: FILE: include/net/dn_nsp.h:40:
+extern struct sk_buff *dn_alloc_send_skb(struct sock *sk, size_t *size, int noblock, long timeo, int *err);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
