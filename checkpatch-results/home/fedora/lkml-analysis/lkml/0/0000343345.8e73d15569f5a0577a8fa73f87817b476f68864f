#27: 
In order to get the best possible resolution we need to use NR_CPUS instead of the constant value 10.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#39: 
--- a/kernel/sched.c	Fri Aug 22 14:24:11 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
