# fix log option code so that it actually works for all udev programs.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#59: 
--- a/logging.h	Wed Feb 11 14:10:36 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#77: FILE: logging.h:62:
+extern int log_ok(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros starting with if should be enclosed by a do - while loop to avoid possible if/else logic defects
#181: FILE: udev_config.c:82:
+#define set_bool(_name, _var)				\
+	if (strcasecmp(variable, _name) == 0) {		\
+		dbg_parse("%s = '%s'", _name, value);	\

+	}

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)
