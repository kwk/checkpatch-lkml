ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#64: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:449:
+static struct atkbd *atkbd_blinkdev = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#65: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:450:
+int atkbd_blink(char led) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#102: FILE: include/linux/morseops.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

#117: FILE: include/linux/morseops.h:16:

[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
