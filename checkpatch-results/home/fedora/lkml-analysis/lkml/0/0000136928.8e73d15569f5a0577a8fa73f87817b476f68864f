CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#45: FILE: include/asm-i386/desc.h:274:
+extern void destroy_ldt(mm_context_t *pc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#46: FILE: include/asm-i386/desc.h:275:
+extern int copy_ldt(mm_context_t *new, mm_context_t *old);

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#63: FILE: include/asm-i386/mmu_context.h:15:
+	struct mm_struct * old_mm;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#69: FILE: include/asm-i386/mmu_context.h:21:
+	if (old_mm && unlikely(old_mm->context.ldt)) {
+		retval = copy_ldt(&mm->context, &old_mm->context);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
