#30: 
I've revised my patch to make sure a process in one namespace doesn't change

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#59: FILE: fs/namei.c:441:
+	for (;;) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#62: FILE: fs/namei.c:444:
+			struct vfsmount *mounted;
+			spin_lock(&dcache_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dentry *' should also have an identifier name
#416: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:115:
+	struct vfsmount *(*d_automount)(struct dentry *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
