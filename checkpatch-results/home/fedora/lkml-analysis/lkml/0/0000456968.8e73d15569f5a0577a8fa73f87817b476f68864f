ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#51: FILE: drivers/block/floppy.c:3864:
+	complete((struct completion*)bio->bi_private);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#103: FILE: drivers/block/floppy.c:3916:
+		printk("No block device for %s\n", __bdevname(dev));

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#104: FILE: drivers/block/floppy.c:3917:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
