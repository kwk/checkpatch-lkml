WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#17: 
Subject: [PATCH 6/10] Re: [2.6-BK-URL] NTFS: 2.1.19 sparse annotation, cleanups

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

+	vcn = sle64_to_cpup((sle64*)((u8*)ie + le16_to_cpu(ie->length) - 8));

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
