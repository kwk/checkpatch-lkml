ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#71: 
--- a/arch/alpha/kernel/module.c	Mon Jan 13 10:49:22 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

#79: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/module.c:194:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
