> 	Subject: Re: ATI RS480-based motherboard: stuck while booting with kernel >= 2.6.15 rc1

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'funtions' may be misspelled - perhaps 'functions'?
#84: 
Oh dear.  We have 394 funtions all called 'init()' in the kernel. 
                      ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#113: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:889:
+		printk("pci_init: %04x%04x\n", dev->vendor, dev->device);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pci_init', this function's name, in a string
#113: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:889:
+		printk("pci_init: %04x%04x\n", dev->vendor, dev->device);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
