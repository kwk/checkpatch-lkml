ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#43: 
--- a/drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c	Tue Mar 16 13:20:05 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#67: FILE: drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c:1380:
 } hid_blacklist[] = {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns

+	{ USB_VENDOR_ID_HAPP, USB_DEVICE_ID_UGCI_DRIVING, HID_QUIRK_BADPAD | HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'usage->type == EV_KEY'
#162: FILE: drivers/usb/input/hid-input.c:488:
+	if((usage->type == EV_KEY) && (usage->code == 0)) /* Key 0 is "unassigned", not KEY_UNKNOWN */

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
