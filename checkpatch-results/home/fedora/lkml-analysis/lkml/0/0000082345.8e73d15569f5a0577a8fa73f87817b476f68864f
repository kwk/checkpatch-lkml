WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#49: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:1158:
+	BUG_ON(irq != AUTO_ASSIGN && (unsigned)irq >= NR_IRQ_VECTORS);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
