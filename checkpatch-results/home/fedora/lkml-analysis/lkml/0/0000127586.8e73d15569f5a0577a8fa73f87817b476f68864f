The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#165: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:21:
+extern void delayacct_tsk_init(struct task_struct *tsk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
