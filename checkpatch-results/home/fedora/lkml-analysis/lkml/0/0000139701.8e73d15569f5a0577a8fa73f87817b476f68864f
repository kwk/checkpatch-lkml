WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#101: FILE: arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c:42:
+extern int end;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

+#ifndef _LINUX_INFLATE_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.
