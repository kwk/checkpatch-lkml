CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#152: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:194:
+		bio = bio_map_user(bdev, (unsigned long) hdr.dxferp,

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#165: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:205:
+			if (writing) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#169: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:209:
+			} else

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#191: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:231:
+	rq->bio = rq->biotail = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
