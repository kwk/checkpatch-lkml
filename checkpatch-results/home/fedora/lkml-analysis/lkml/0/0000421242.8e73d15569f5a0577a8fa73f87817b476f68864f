WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#66: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:671:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(dump_send_ipi);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#85: FILE: include/asm-i386/smp.h:57:
+extern void dump_send_ipi(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
