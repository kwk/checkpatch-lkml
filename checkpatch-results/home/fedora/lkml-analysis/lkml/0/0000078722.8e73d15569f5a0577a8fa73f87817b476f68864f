#ifdef CONFIG_SHOW_ALL_UNINIT_WARNINGS

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#61: FILE: sem.c:812:
+       struct sem_setbuf init_self(setbuf);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'setbuf' should also have an identifier name
#61: FILE: sem.c:812:
+       struct sem_setbuf init_self(setbuf);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
