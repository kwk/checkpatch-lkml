ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#161: FILE: net/ipv6/route.c:84:
cookie);

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#199: FILE: net/ipv6/route.c:146:
+	struct rt6_info *rt = (struct rt6_info *)dst;
+	if (rt->rt6i_idev != NULL)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "rt->rt6i_idev"
#199: FILE: net/ipv6/route.c:146:
+	if (rt->rt6i_idev != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#201: FILE: net/ipv6/route.c:148:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <OutNoRoutes>
#289: FILE: net/ipv6/route.c:1276:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
