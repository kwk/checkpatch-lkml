WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#36: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/Kconfig:39:
+config HW_RANDOM_GEODE
+	tristate "AMD Geode HW Random Number Generator support"
+	depends on HW_RANDOM && (X86 || IA64) && PCI
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  This driver provides kernel-side support for the Random Number
+	  Generator hardware found on AMD Geode based motherboards.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called geode-rng.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
