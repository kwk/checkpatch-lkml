CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*n)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct notifier_block)...)
#53: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:266:
+		n = kmalloc(sizeof(struct notifier_block),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#54: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:267:
+		n = kmalloc(sizeof(struct notifier_block),
+					GFP_ATOMIC);

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#60: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:273:
+ ^I^I}$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
