ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#42: FILE: drivers/md/lvm.c:380:
+static int lvm_hardsizes[MAX_LV] =
+{0,};

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
