Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#77: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:83:
+	int zonelist = GFP_ZONEMASK & (__force int) gfp;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#78: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:84:
+	int zonelist = GFP_ZONEMASK & (__force int) gfp;
+	BUG_ON(zonelist >= GFP_ZONETYPES);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#78: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:84:
+	BUG_ON(zonelist >= GFP_ZONETYPES);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#121: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1109:
+	return NODE_DATA(nd)->node_zonelists + gfp_zonelist(gfp);
