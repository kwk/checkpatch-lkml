CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#325: FILE: kernel/printk.c:33:
+#define LOG_BUF_LEN	(1 << CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT)	/* This must be a power of two */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
