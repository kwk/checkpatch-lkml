WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'reosurce' may be misspelled - perhaps 'resource'?
#57: FILE: kernel/resource.c:247:

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#66: FILE: kernel/resource.c:256:
+	BUG_ON(!res);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#72: FILE: kernel/resource.c:262:
+	for( p = iomem_resource.child; p ; p = p->sibling) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#72: FILE: kernel/resource.c:262:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#107: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:110:
+extern int find_next_system_ram(struct resource *res);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#142: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:159:
+                           ((res.end + 1 - res.start) >> PAGE_SHIFT);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#142: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:159:
+                           ((res.end + 1 - res.start) >> PAGE_SHIFT);$

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#148: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:165:
+				struct page *page = pfn_to_page(start_pfn + i);
+				online_page(page);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
