#24: 
Most of the patches necessary to get the IDE controller in the ICH4 (82801DB) on the Intel D845GBV motherboard are already in 2.4.19-rc1.  (These are the issues in the mail thread  "Anthony Spinillo" <tspinillo@linuxmail.org> started on June 1, 2002.)

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#38: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c:1253:
+	{ PCI_FIXUP_HEADER,	PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL,	PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801DB_11,	pci_fixup_ide_trash },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
