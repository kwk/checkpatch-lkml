#32: 
 It changes the behavior of ReiserFS from loading and caching all the bitmaps

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bh"
#104: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:162:
+	if (bh == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'performace' may be misspelled - perhaps 'performance'?
#121: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:274:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#123: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:276:
+	 * read and potentially having a bad placement. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#126: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:279:
+		struct buffer_head *bh = reiserfs_read_bitmap_block(s, bm);
+		brelse(bh);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#129: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:282:
+	if (info->free_count > ((s->s_blocksize << 3) * 60 / 100)) {
 		return 0;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#163: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:1328:
+^I^I                 "reading failed", __FUNCTION__, bh->b_blocknr);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

#169: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:1334:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
