Signed-Off-By: Chandra Seetharaman <sekharan@us.ibm.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (16, 25)
#59: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:36:
+		if (!ctlr)
+			 continue;

WARNING:TABSTOP: Statements should start on a tabstop
#60: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:37:
+			 continue;

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#79: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:56:
+	{parse_res_type, RES_STRING"=%s"},

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#84: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:61:
+static int stats_parse(const char *options,
+				char **resname, char **remaining_line)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!remaining_line"
#103: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:80:
+			if (*remaining_line == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#153: FILE: kernel/res_group/rgcs.c:130:
+		.ca_mode = S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
