ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#60: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:19:
+int es7000_plat = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'irq < 16'
#74: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:1133:
+			if (!ioapic && (irq < 16))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
