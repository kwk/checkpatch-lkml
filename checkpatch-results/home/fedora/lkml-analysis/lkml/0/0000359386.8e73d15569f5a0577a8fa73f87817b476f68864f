--- a/drivers/char/watchdog/mixcomwd.c	Wed Jun 25 16:18:28 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#62: FILE: drivers/char/watchdog/mixcomwd.c:220:
+	if (!request_region(port, 1, "MixCOM watchdog")) {
 		return 0;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
