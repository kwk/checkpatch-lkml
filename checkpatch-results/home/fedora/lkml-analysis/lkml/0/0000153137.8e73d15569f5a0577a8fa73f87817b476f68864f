#29: 
[PATCH 23/25] NTFS: Fix page_has_buffers()/page_buffers() handling in fs/ntfs/aops.c.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#70: FILE: fs/ntfs/aops.c:195:
+	bh = head = page_buffers(page);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#71: FILE: fs/ntfs/aops.c:196:
+	BUG_ON(!bh);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#81: FILE: fs/ntfs/aops.c:537:
+			ntfs_warning(vol->sb, "Error allocating page "
+					"buffers.  Redirtying page so we try "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
