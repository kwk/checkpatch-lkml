WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#309: FILE: drivers/s390/char/raw3270.c:1122:
+	void (*notifier)(int, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*np)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct raw3270_notifier)...)
#319: FILE: drivers/s390/char/raw3270.c:1132:
+	np = kmalloc(sizeof(struct raw3270_notifier), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
