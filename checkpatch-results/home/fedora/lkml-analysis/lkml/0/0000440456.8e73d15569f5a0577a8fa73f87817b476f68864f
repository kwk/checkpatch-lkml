CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#34: FILE: include/asm-alpha/rwsem.h:24:
+extern struct rw_semaphore *rwsem_downgrade_wake(struct rw_semaphore *sem);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#120: FILE: include/asm-alpha/rwsem.h:205:
+	long temp;
+	__asm__ __volatile__(

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
