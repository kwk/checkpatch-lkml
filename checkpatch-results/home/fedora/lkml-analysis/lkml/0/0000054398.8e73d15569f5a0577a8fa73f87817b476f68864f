CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:133:
+extern void FASTCALL(__lock_page_nosync(struct page *page));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#101: FILE: mm/filemap.c:593:
+	DEFINE_WAIT_BIT(wait, &page->flags, PG_locked);
+	__wait_on_bit_lock(page_waitqueue(page), &wait, __sleep_on_page_lock,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#102: FILE: mm/filemap.c:594:
+	__wait_on_bit_lock(page_waitqueue(page), &wait, __sleep_on_page_lock,
