CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#136: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:247:
+	current->mm->env_end = (unsigned long) p;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#155: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1209:
+		if (current->mm->arg_end > current->mm->arg_start) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#158: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1212:
+				len = ELF_PRARGSZ-1;
 				                 ^

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#159: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1213:
+		} else

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#280: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:407:
+	if (!sb) return;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#300: FILE: fs/proc/inode.c:182:
+struct super_block *proc_super = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
