WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#73: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1877:
+		if (up->port.irq == released_irq) {
+			continue;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

not empty like the former::

only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and

kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
