WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#17: 
Subject: [PATCH 9/10] Re: [2.6-BK-URL] NTFS: 2.1.19 sparse annotation, cleanups

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#129: FILE: fs/ntfs/super.c:2577:
+ntfschar *default_upcase = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
