WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'kernel' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#79: FILE: exit.c:56:
+repeat: $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#92: FILE: exit.c:78:
+		BUG_ON(leader->exit_signal == -1);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
