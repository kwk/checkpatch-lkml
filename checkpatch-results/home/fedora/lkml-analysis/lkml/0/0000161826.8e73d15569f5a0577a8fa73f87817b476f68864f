WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 195 exceeds 100 columns

+		printk("packets_out = %d, fackets_out = %d, reordering = %d, sack_ok = 0x%x, mss_cache=%d\n", tp->packets_out, tp->fackets_out, tp->reordering, tp->rx_opt.sack_ok, tp->mss_cache);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
