ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#36: 
--- a/drivers/base/platform.c	2004-12-08 16:59:52 -06:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#49: FILE: drivers/base/platform.c:68:
+platform_get_resource_byname(struct platform_device *dev, unsigned int type,
+		      char * name)

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#49: FILE: drivers/base/platform.c:68:
+		      char * name)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: space preferred before that '|' (ctx:VxE)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!r->name"
#86: FILE: drivers/base/platform.c:142:
+		if (r->name == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#96: FILE: drivers/base/platform.c:349:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(platform_get_resource_byname);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#101: FILE: include/linux/fsl_devices.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#102: FILE: include/linux/fsl_devices.h:2:
+ * include/linux/fsl_devices.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#104: FILE: include/linux/fsl_devices.h:4:
+ * Definitions for any platform device related flags or structures for $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <interruptPHY>
#128: FILE: include/linux/fsl_devices.h:28:
+	uint interruptPHY;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
