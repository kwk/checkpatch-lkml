specified by the community.

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#84: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/kprobes.c:259:
+	kprobe_saved_rflags = kprobe_old_rflags
+		= (regs->eflags & (TF_MASK | IF_MASK));

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'kprobe_status != KPROBE_REENTER'
#144: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/kprobes.c:453:
+	if ((kprobe_status != KPROBE_REENTER) && current_kprobe->post_handler) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
