ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#43: FILE: drivers/pci/search.c:419:
+	struct pci_device_id * found = NULL;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#49: FILE: drivers/pci/search.c:425:
+			if ((found = pci_match_one_device(ids, dev)) != NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pci_find_present"
#85: FILE: drivers/pci/search.c:448:
+	return pci_find_present(ids) == NULL ? 0 : 1;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
