# --------------------------------------------

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#155: FILE: drivers/pnp/pnpbios/core.c:77:
+static union pnp_bios_install_struct * pnp_bios_install = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

#155: FILE: drivers/pnp/pnpbios/core.c:77:
+static union pnp_bios_install_struct * pnp_bios_install = NULL;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
