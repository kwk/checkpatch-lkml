Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#81: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:1:
+/* delayacct.h - per-task delay accounting

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#102: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:22:
+extern int delayacct_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#103: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:23:

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct task_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#103: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:23:
+extern void __delayacct_tsk_init(struct task_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
