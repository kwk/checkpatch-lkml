#29: 
This patch adds support for Intel VRD 10.0 and AMD Opteron VID calculations.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#57: FILE: include/linux/i2c-vid.h:41:
+        . . . .$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#63: FILE: include/linux/i2c-vid.h:47:
+/*
+    Legal val values 0x00 - 0x1f; except for VRD 10.0, 0x00 - 0x3f.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#74: FILE: include/linux/i2c-vid.h:62:
 	switch(vrm) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
