WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#63: FILE: depmod.c:297:
+	if (base) return base + 1;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#78: FILE: depmod.c:312:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#192: FILE: moduleops.c:75:
+			if (owner) {
[...]
-			else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
