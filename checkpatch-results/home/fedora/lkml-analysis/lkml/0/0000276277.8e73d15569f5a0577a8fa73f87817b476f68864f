CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#48: FILE: sound/i2c/cs8427.c:214:
+	chip = device->private_data = kcalloc(sizeof(*chip), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:ALLOC_ARRAY_ARGS: kcalloc uses number as first arg, sizeof is generally wrong
#48: FILE: sound/i2c/cs8427.c:214:
+	chip = device->private_data = kcalloc(sizeof(*chip), GFP_KERNEL);

The first argument for kcalloc or kmalloc_array should be the
number of elements.  sizeof() as the first argument is generally
wrong.
