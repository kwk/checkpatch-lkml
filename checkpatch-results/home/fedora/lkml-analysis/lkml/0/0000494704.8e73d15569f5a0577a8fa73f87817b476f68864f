+	{ PCI_FIXUP_FINAL,      PCI_VENDOR_ID_AL,       PCI_DEVICE_ID_AL_M1533,         quirk_isa_dma_hangs },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
