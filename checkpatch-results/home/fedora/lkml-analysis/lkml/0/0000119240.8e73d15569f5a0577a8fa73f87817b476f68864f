WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#103: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:218:
+	loff_t retval = -EINVAL;
+	switch (orig) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#106: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:221:
+	/* fallthrough */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#110: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:225:
+		file->f_pos = retval = offset;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
