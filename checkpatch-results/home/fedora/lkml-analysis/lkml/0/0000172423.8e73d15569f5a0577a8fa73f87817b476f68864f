[PATCH] acpi hotplug: decouple slot power state changes from physical hotplug

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#104: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/acpiphp_glue.c:772:
+	list_for_each (l, &slot->funcs) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#116: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/acpiphp_glue.c:784:
+			if (ACPI_FAILURE(status)) {
[...]

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
