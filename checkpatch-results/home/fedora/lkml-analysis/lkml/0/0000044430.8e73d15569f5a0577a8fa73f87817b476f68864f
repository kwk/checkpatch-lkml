CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#116: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1075:
+extern void vm_revoke_write(struct vm_area_struct *vma);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#143: FILE: mm/mprotect.c:126:
+	if (!(vma->vm_flags & (VM_WRITE|VM_MAYWRITE)))
 	                               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
