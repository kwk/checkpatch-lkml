WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#71: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1372:
+		BUG_ON(system_state == SYSTEM_BOOTING);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#72: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1373:

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#87: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1385:
+ ^I^Ikswapd_run(nid);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#87: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1385:
+ ^I^Ikswapd_run(nid);$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#87: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1385:
+ ^I^Ikswapd_run(nid);$

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#106: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:215:
+extern int kswapd_run(int nid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
