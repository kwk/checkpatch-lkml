CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#45: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:114:
+extern void show_stack(unsigned long *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#48: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:117:
+#define arch_show_stack(p)	printk("show_stack() unsupported\n");

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#48: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:117:
+#define arch_show_stack(p)	printk("show_stack() unsupported\n");

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
