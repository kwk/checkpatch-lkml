WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#57: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/generic.c:139:
+	{ PCI_VENDOR_ID_TOSHIBA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_TOSHIBA_PICCOLO,	   PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 10},

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
