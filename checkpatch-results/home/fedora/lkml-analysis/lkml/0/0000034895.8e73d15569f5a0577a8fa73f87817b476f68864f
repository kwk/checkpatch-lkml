#90: FILE: fs/sysfs/bin.c:196:
+void sysfs_remove_bin_file(struct kobject * kobj, struct bin_attribute * attr)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#158: FILE: fs/sysfs/sysfs.h:13:
+extern int sysfs_hash_and_remove(struct dentry * dir, const char * name);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
