CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:182:
+extern long os_ptrace_ldt(long pid, long addr, long data);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#78: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/process.c:108:
+long os_ptrace_ldt(long pid, long addr, long data) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
