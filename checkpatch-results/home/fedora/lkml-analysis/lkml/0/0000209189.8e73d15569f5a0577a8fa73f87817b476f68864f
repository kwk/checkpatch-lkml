ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#60: FILE: input/gameport/ns558.c:264:
+static int registered = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
