ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#54: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/pcilynx.c:767:
+        int cid = minor(inode->i_rdev);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#65: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/raw1394.c:918:
+        if (minor(inode->i_rdev)) {
                 return -ENXIO;
         }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#85: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/video1394.c:862:
+		PRINT_G(KERN_ERR, __FUNCTION__": Unknown video card for minor %d", minor(inode->i_rdev));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#85: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/video1394.c:862:
+		PRINT_G(KERN_ERR, __FUNCTION__": Unknown video card for minor %d", minor(inode->i_rdev));

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
