ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#176: FILE: include/linux/timer.h:35:
+void fastcall init_timer(struct timer_list * timer);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "timer->entry.next"
#185: FILE: include/linux/timer.h:49:
+	return timer->entry.next != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#548: FILE: kernel/timer.c:394:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(del_timer_sync);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#557: FILE: kernel/timer.c:412:
+		BUG_ON(tmp->_base != &base->t_base);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
