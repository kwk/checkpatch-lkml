ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#58: FILE: kmod.c:172:
+	const char * p;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
