+						if (copy_from_user(dev->mdm.info[i].emu.plmsn, p, ISDN_LMSNLEN))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#49: FILE: isdn/isdn_common.c:1524:
+						if (copy_from_user(dev->mdm.info[i].emu.plmsn, p, ISDN_LMSNLEN))

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
