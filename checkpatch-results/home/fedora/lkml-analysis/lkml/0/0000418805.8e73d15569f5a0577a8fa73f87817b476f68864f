ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
