WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#98: FILE: net/bluetooth/hci_sock.c:450:
+static int hci_sock_setsockopt(struct socket *sock, int level, int optname, char __user *optval, int len)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns

+static int hci_sock_getsockopt(struct socket *sock, int level, int optname, char __user *optval, int __user *optlen)

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct proto_ops should normally be const
#116: FILE: net/bluetooth/hci_sock.c:570:
+static struct proto_ops hci_sock_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
