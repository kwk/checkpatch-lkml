+	Network packet tracering is achived using kernel probes allowing you
+	to see the network packets while moving up and down the stack. This
+	module uses kprobes mechanism which is highly efficient for dynamic
+	tracing.

+	See driver/net/netpktlog.c for details.

+	This driver will be always compiled as kernel module.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
