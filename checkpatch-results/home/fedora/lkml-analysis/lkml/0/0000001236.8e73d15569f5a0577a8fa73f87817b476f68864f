CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#100: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c:423:

+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#101: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c:424:
+			if (addr == (long) &dummy->u_debugreg[4]) break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+			 * Programming) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
