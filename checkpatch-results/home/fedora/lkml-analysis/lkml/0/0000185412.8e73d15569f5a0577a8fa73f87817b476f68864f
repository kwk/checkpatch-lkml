#25: 
This patch disables unique IO_APIC_ID check for xAPIC systems running in EM64T mode. Xeon-based ES7000s panic failing this unnecessary check. I added IOAPIC_ID_CHECK config option and turned it off for Intel processors. Also added the boot option that overrides default and turnes this check on/off in case it is needed for some reason. Hope this is acceptable way to fix the problem.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#72: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/io_apic.c:239:

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#140: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/proto.h:78:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
