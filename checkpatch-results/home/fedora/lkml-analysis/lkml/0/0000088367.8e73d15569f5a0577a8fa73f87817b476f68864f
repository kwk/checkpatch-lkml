Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sg"
#81: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6093:
+			if (sg == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#111: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6123:
+	sched_group_nodes = kzalloc(sizeof(struct sched_group*)*MAX_NUMNODES,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
