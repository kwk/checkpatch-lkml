WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#77: FILE: init/Kconfig:318:
+config DOUBLEFAULT
+	depends X86
+	default y if X86
+	bool "Enable doublefault exception handler" if EMBEDDED
+	help
+          This option allows trapping of rare doublefault exceptions that
+          would otherwise cause a system to silently reboot. Disabling this
+          option saves about 4k.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
