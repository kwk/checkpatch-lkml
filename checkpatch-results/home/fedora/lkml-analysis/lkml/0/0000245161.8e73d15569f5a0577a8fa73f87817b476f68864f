CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#655: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/irq.h:89:
+extern int call_handle_IRQ_event(int irq, struct pt_regs *regs,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#656: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/irq.h:90:
+extern int call_handle_IRQ_event(int irq, struct pt_regs *regs,
 			struct irqaction *action, struct thread_info *tp);

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_crit([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_crit(dev, ... then pr_crit(...  to printk(KERN_CRIT ...
#707: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/hardirq.h:24:
+	printk(KERN_CRIT "illegal vector %d received!\n", irq);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#708: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/hardirq.h:25:
+	BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
