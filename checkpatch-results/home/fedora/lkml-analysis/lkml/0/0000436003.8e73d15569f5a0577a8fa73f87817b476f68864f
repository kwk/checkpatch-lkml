ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/fs/inode.c	Sat Aug 31 18:49:37 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
