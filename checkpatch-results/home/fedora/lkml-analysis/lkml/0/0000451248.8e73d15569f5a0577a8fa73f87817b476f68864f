Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SCpnt>
#194: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c:1125:
+		rtn = scsi_check_sense(SCpnt);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#195: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c:1126:
+		if (rtn == NEEDS_RETRY) {
+			goto maybe_retry;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
