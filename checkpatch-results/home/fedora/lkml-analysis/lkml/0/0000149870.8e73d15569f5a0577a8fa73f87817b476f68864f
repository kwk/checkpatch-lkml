WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'proirity' may be misspelled - perhaps 'priority'?

since P3 is the highest proirity and P1 inherits that prio.  But what

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#116: FILE: kernel/rt.c:861:
+		if (!plist_empty(&w->pi_list)) {
[...]
-			plist_del(&w->list, &l->wait_list);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
