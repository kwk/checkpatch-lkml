This is quite straighforward. Thanks John. However, the ITC

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#102: FILE: drivers/timesource/itc.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#103: FILE: drivers/timesource/itc.c:2:
+ * drivers/timesource/itc.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#138: FILE: drivers/timesource/itc.c:31:

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#142: FILE: drivers/timesource/itc.c:35:
+__setup("itc_nojitter", nojitter_setup);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#152: FILE: drivers/timesource/itc.c:45:
+static cycle_t itc_filtered(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#230: FILE: drivers/timesource/sn2_rtc.c:10:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
