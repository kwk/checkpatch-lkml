[PATCH] PCI: make pci_find_subsys() static, as it should not be used anymore

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#51: FILE: drivers/pci/search.c:159:
+static struct pci_dev * pci_find_subsys(unsigned int vendor,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#52: FILE: drivers/pci/search.c:160:
+^I^I^I^I        unsigned int device,$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
