CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#149: FILE: mm/slab.c:2758:
+	nid_alloc = nid_here = numa_node_id();

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#162: FILE: mm/slab.c:2771:
+	if (unlikely(current->flags & (PF_MEM_SPREAD|PF_MEMPOLICY))) {
 	                                            ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#164: FILE: mm/slab.c:2773:
+		void *obj = alternate_node_alloc(cachep, flags);
+		if (obj)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#184: FILE: mm/slab.c:2793:
+static __always_inline void * cache_alloc(struct kmem_cache *cachep,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
