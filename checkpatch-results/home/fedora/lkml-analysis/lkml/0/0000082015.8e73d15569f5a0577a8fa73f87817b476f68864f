CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#98: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:126:
+extern void __kfree(const void *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '==' (ctx:VxV)
#102: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:130:
+	if (__builtin_constant_p(ptr==NULL)) {
 	                            ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ptr"
#102: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:130:
+	if (__builtin_constant_p(ptr==NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
