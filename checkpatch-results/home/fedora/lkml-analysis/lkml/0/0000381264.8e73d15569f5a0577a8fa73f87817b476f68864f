WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#50: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1635:
+				struct sysinfo si;
+				si_meminfo(&si);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#51: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1636:
+				size = ((unsigned long long)si.totalram << PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT) / 100 * size;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
