WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'dissapearing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'disappearing'?
#31: 
buffers from dissapearing under heavy traffic.
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#70: FILE: drivers/net/arcnet/arcnet.c:626:
+	if(lp->next_tx == -1)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#72: FILE: drivers/net/arcnet/arcnet.c:628:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
