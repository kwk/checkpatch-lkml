CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#88: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:631:
+	if (iv.tv64 && (timr->it_requeue_pending & REQUEUE_PENDING ||
+	    (timr->it_sigev_notify & ~SIGEV_THREAD_ID) == SIGEV_NONE))

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#96: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:636:

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
