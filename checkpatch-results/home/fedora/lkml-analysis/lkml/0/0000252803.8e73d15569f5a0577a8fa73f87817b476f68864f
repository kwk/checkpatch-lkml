CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#84: FILE: mm/shmem.c:222:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#122: FILE: mm/shmem.c:615:
+		BUG_ON(inode->i_blocks);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#272: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1865:
+		unsigned long inodes = totalram_pages - totalhigh_pages;
+		if (inodes > blocks)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*sbinfo)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct shmem_sb_info)...)
#279: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1872:
+		sbinfo = kmalloc(sizeof(struct shmem_sb_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
