WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct address_space_operations should normally be const
#336: FILE: drivers/block/rd.c:313:
+struct address_space_operations ramdisk_aops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
