WARNING:DEFAULT_NO_BREAK: switch default: should use break
#338: FILE: drivers/net/pppoe.c:740:

switch default case is sometimes written as "default:;".  This can
cause new cases added below default to be defective.

A "break;" should be added after empty default statement to avoid
unwanted fallthrough.
