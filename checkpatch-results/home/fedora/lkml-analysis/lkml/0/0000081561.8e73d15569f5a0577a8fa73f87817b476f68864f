WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#41: FILE: drivers/rtc/Kconfig:76:
+config RTC_INTF_DEV_X
+	bool "Extended RTC operation"
+	depends on RTC_INTF_DEV
+	help
+	  Provides an emulation for RTC_UIE.

 comment "RTC drivers"

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#77: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-dev.c:70:
+	if (rtc->oldsecs != tmp) {
[...]
+	} else if (schedule_work(&rtc->uie_task) == 0)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#81: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-dev.c:74:
+		rtc->timer_task.expires = jiffies + HZ - (HZ/10);
 		                                            ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#96: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-dev.c:89:
+	unsigned long flags;
+	spin_lock_irqsave(&rtc->irq_lock, flags);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#126: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-dev.c:119:
+	int start = 0;
+	spin_lock_irq(&rtc->irq_lock);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#128: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-dev.c:121:
+		start = rtc->irq_active = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#133: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-dev.c:126:
+		struct rtc_time tm;
+		rtc->stop_rtc_timers = 0;

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#158: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-dev.c:323:
+^I        set_uie(rtc);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
