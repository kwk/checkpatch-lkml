Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around function pointer (dentry->d_op->d_revalidate)
#158: FILE: fs/autofs4/root.c:147:
+		ret = (dentry->d_op->d_revalidate)(dentry, &nd);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#220: FILE: fs/autofs4/root.c:201:
+		struct file *fp = cursor->d_fsdata;
+		if (!fp) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
