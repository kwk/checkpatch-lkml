Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#62: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:25:
+	BUILD_BUG_ON(NR_CPUS/4 > PAGE_SIZE/2);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#75: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:93:
+	BUG_ON(count > PAGE_SIZE);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
