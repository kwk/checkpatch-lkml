Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#115: FILE: dmsetup/dmsetup.c:518:
+	if (!(dmt = dm_task_create(DM_DEVICE_SETGEO)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#375: FILE: drivers/md/dm-table.c:959:
+	if (!sects) {
+		return -ENOTTY;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
