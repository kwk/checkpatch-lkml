#31: 
Here is an alternative that rearranges to put all function prototypes in atalk.h

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#36: 
--- a/include/linux/atalk.h	2004-08-11 17:00:00 -07:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#42: FILE: include/linux/atalk.h:194:
+extern void		 aarp_probe_network(struct atalk_iface *atif);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#59: FILE: include/linux/atalk.h:215:
+extern struct file_operations atalk_seq_arp_fops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
