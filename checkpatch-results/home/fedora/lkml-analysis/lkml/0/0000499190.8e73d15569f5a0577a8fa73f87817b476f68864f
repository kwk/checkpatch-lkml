CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#117: FILE: include/asm-ppc/processor.h:643:
+extern int set_fpexc_mode(struct task_struct *tsk, unsigned int val);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
