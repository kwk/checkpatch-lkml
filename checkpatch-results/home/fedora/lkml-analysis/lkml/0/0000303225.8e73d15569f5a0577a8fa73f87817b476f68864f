The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#102: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:61:
+int kgdboe = 0; /* Default to tty mode */

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#151: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:110:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#160: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:119:
+			in_head = in_tail = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#189: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:148:
+		printk("kgdb: too manu cpus. Cannot enable debugger with more than %d cpus\n", CONFIG_NO_KGDB_CPUS);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
