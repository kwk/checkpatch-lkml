CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#75: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/prom.c:273:
+	np->intrs = (struct interrupt_info *) (*mem_start);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "child"
#289: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/prom.c:546:
+	for (child = np->child; child != NULL; child = child->sibling) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#319: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/prom.c:579:
+	end = start = (unsigned long)abs_to_virt(lmb_alloc(size, 128));

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#321: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/prom.c:581:
+	BUG_ON(end != start + size);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#322: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/prom.c:582:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
