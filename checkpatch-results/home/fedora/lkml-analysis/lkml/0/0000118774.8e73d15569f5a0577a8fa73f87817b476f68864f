#38: 
Mark the f_ops members of inodes as const, as well as fix the ripple-through

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#225: FILE: drivers/oprofile/oprofilefs.c:133:
+	struct dentry * root, char const * name, const struct file_operations * fops,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#353: FILE: fs/proc/internal.h:33:
+extern void create_seq_entry(char *name, mode_t mode, const struct file_operations *f);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct cdev *' should also have an identifier name
#399: FILE: include/linux/cdev.h:14:
+void cdev_init(struct cdev *, const struct file_operations *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

#527: FILE: include/linux/sound.h:34:

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#640: FILE: sound/core/init.c:166:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
