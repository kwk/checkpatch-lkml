#57: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:115:
+/* logo_shown is an index to vc_cons when >= 0; otherwise follows FBCON_LOGO

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'info->fix.type == FB_TYPE_TEXT'
#100: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:838:
+	if (vc->vc_num != display_fg || logo_shown == FBCON_LOGO_DONTSHOW ||
 	    (info->fix.type == FB_TYPE_TEXT))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
