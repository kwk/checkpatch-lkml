WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#53: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:2753:
+	 * locks_copy_lock: */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'nfsd4_lock', this function's name, in a string
#57: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:2757:
+	dprintk("NFSD: nfsd4_lock: posix_lock_file_conf status %d\n",status);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
