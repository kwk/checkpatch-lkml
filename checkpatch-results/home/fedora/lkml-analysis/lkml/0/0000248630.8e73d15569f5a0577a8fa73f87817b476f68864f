Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
