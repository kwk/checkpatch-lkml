CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#127: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:558:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#184: FILE: home/petero/ftp/kernel/2.6/linux/drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:526:
+			int need_write_seek = 1;
+			spin_lock(&pd->iosched.lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'bio->bi_sector == pd->iosched.last_write'
#187: FILE: home/petero/ftp/kernel/2.6/linux/drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:529:
+			if (bio && (bio->bi_sector == pd->iosched.last_write))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
