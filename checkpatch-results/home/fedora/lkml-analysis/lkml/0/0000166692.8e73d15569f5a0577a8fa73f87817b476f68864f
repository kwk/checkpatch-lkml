#42: FILE: include/linux/i2c-isa.h:30:
+/* Detect whether we are on the isa bus. This is only useful to hybrid
+   (i2c+isa) drivers. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
