WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#35: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c:451:
+extern char wakeup_start, wakeup_end;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#50: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c:478:
+	memcpy((void *) acpi_wakeup_address, &wakeup_start, &wakeup_end - &wakeup_start);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
