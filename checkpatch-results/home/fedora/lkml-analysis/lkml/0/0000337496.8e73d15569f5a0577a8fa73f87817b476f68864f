CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#155: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:101:
+extern void cpu_sched_info(struct sched_info *, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct sched_info *' should also have an identifier name
#155: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:101:
+extern void cpu_sched_info(struct sched_info *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#240: FILE: kernel/sched.c:246:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#296: FILE: kernel/sched.c:302:

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#297: FILE: kernel/sched.c:303:
+	for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#300: FILE: kernel/sched.c:306:
+		if (!cpu_online(i)) continue;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#402: FILE: kernel/sched.c:445:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
