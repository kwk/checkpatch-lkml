# Driver core: add class_device_find function

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#61: 
--- a/drivers/base/class.c	Tue Mar  2 12:02:30 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

#77: FILE: drivers/base/class.c:388:
+struct class_device * class_device_find(struct class *class, const char *class_id)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#112: FILE: include/linux/device.h:217:
+extern struct class_device * class_device_find(struct class *class, const char *class_id);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
