WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#36: 
# /usr/bin/time dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/zero count=1k

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#122: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:821:
+		if (sizeof(time) > 4) {
+			num ^= (u32)(time >> 32);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
