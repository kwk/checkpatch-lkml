WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#76: FILE: kernel/module.c:465:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#93: FILE: kernel/module.c:482:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
