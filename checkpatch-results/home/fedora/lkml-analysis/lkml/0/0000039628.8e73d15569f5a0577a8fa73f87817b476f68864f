ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_EARLY_CURRENT' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#66: FILE: include/asm-i386/current.h:9:
+#define ARCH_HAS_EARLY_CURRENT 1

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
