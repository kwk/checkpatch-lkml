CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided

+	cycle_last = cycle_last_interval = read_clocksource(clock);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#167: FILE: include/linux/timeofday.h:35:
+extern void timeofday_update_cycles(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
