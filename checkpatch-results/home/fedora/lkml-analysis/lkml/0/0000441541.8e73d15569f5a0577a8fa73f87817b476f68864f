WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#191: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:226:
+struct seq_operations partitions_op = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#294: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:716:
+^Iif (hd2)^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
