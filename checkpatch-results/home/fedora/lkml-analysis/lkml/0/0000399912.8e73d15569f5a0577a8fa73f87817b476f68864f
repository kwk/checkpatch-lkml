CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Elf_Sym>
#93: FILE: kernel/module.c:828:
+	Elf_Sym *sym = (void *)sechdrs[symindex].sh_addr;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#113: FILE: kernel/module.c:849:
+			sym[i].st_value
+				= module_find_symbol(strtab + sym[i].st_name,

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#116: FILE: kernel/module.c:852:
+			/* Don't barf here if not found: some archs
+			   (ie. ppc64) can handle this. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#116: FILE: kernel/module.c:852:
+			   (ie. ppc64) can handle this. */

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:ExV)
#125: FILE: kernel/module.c:861:
+							       +sym[i].st_name,
 							       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
