ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#54: FILE: include/linux/jbd.h:230:
+^I  = BH_PrivateStart,^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#54: FILE: include/linux/jbd.h:230:
+	BH_JBD			/* Has an attached ext3 journal_head */
+	  = BH_PrivateStart,	

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <BH_JBDDirty>
#59: FILE: include/linux/jbd.h:235:
+	BH_JBDDirty,		/* Is dirty but journaled */

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
