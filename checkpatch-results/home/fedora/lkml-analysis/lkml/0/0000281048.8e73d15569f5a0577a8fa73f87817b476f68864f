CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#224: FILE: mm/mremap.c:128:
+			if (dst) {
[...]
-			}
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#229: FILE: mm/mremap.c:132:
+			} else

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#262: FILE: mm/mremap.c:159:
+		if (move_one_page(vma, old_addr+offset, new_addr+offset) < 0)
 		                               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#420: FILE: mm/rmap.c:32:
+	BUG_ON(!page->mapping);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
