#42: 
> In the patch below, isn't there a bootmem page leak in case !pmd_none(*pmd)?

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#69: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:74:
+	pte_t *page_table;
+	if (pmd_none(*pmd)) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#69: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:74:
+	if (pmd_none(*pmd)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#70: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:75:
+		page_table = (pte_t *) alloc_bootmem_low_pages(PAGE_SIZE);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#73: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:78:
+^I^I^IBUG();^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#73: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:78:
+			BUG();	

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
