#27: 
> > The above (AM53C974) driver depends on BROKEN in 2.6 and doesn't compile.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#77: FILE: drivers/scsi/AM53C974.c:387:
+#error "FIXME! Multiple card support is broken. Looks like it never really worked. Might have to be fixed."

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
