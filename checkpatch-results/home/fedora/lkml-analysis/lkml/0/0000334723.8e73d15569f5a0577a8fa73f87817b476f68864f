WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#137: FILE: kernel/resource.c:87:
+struct seq_operations resource_op = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#148: FILE: kernel/resource.c:97:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
