ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#611: FILE: net/llc/llc_conn.c:789:
+static int llc_sk_init(struct sock* sk)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#721: FILE: net/llc/llc_proc.c:188:
+static struct seq_operations llc_seq_socket_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
