CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'p' - possible side-effects?
#85: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1206:
+#define thread_group_leader(p)	(p == p->group_leader)

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'p' may be better as '(p)' to avoid precedence issues
#85: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1206:
+#define thread_group_leader(p)	(p == p->group_leader)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#100: FILE: fs/exec.c:724:
+		leader->parent = leader->real_parent = current;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
