ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#81: FILE: sata_vsc.c:163:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#81: FILE: sata_vsc.c:163:
+        static int int_count = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
