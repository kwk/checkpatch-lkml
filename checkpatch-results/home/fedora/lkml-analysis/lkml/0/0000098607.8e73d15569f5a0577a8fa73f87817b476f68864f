Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

+struct mem_ctl_info * edac_mc_del_mc(struct pci_dev *pdev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#198: FILE: drivers/edac/edac_mc.h:413:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
