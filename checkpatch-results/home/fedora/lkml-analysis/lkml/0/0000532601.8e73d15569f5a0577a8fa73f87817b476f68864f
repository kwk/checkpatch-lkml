ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

+        */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SRpnt>

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+       if(SRpnt == NULL) {
+               return i;
+       }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!SRpnt"
#44: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:737:
+       if(SRpnt == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
