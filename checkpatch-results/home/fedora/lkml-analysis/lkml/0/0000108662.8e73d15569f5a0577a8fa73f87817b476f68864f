ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#59: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/nodemgr.h:178:
+static inline void hpsb_unregister_node_interface(struct class_interface *intf) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
