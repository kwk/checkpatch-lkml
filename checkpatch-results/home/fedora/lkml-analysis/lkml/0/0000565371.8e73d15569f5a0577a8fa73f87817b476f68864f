Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'kernel' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#44: FILE: sysctl.c:1177:
+int sysctl_jiffies(ctl_table *table, int *name, int nlen,
+		void *oldval, size_t *oldlenp,

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#47: FILE: sysctl.c:1180:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
