WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#107: FILE: lk-changelog.pl:11:
+# $Id: lk-changelog.pl,v 0.221 2004/01/23 10:24:51 vita Exp $

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'thur' may be misspelled - perhaps 'their'?
#135: FILE: lk-changelog.pl:157:
+'adi:drcomp.erfurt.thur.de' => 'Adrian Knoth',
