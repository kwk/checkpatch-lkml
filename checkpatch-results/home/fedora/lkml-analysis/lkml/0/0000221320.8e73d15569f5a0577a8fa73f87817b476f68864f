WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#58: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtdpart.c:294:
+/*
+  Setup erase region info for slave devices.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#103: FILE: drivers/mtd/mtdpart.c:339:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
