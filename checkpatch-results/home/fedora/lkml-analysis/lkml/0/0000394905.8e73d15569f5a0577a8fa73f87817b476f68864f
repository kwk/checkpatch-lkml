+int smp_call_function (void (*func) (void *info), void *info, int wait)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#92: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/smp.c:265:
+		while(atomic_read(&smp_fn_call.finished) != num_cpus) {}

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#92: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/smp.c:265:
+		while(atomic_read(&smp_fn_call.finished) != num_cpus) {}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
