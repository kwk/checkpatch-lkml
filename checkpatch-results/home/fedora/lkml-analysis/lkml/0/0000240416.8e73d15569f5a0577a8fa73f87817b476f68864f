ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#99: FILE: fs/ntfs/dir.c:1396:
+				(unsigned long long)((u8*)ie - (u8*)ia));

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
