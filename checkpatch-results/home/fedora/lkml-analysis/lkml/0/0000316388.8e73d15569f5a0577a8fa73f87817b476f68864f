ERROR:IN_ATOMIC: do not use in_atomic in drivers
#153: FILE: drivers/net/irda/sir_kthread.c:440:
+		if (in_interrupt()  ||  in_atomic()  ||  irqs_disabled()) {

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#157: FILE: drivers/net/irda/sir_kthread.c:443:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
