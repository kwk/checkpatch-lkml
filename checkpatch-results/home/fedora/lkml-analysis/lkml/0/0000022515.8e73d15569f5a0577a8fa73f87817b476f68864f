ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#54: FILE: drivers/net/sky2.c:2748:
+static void inline sky2_add_filter(u8 filter[8], const u8 *addr)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
