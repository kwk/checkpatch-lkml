Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Your counting's fine.  But I figured the third cachline was OK

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#95: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:502:
+#define wake_up(x)			__wake_up((x),TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE | TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE | TASK_EXCLUSIVE)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
