Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#150: FILE: kernel/timer.c:859:

+	if (!error)

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '&' (ctx:VxV)
#167: FILE: kernel/timer.c:876:
+	offset = (now - last_clock_cycle)&clock->mask;
 	                                 ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
