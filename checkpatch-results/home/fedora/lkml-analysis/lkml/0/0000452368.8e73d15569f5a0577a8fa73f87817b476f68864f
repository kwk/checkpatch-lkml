ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#113: FILE: drivers/char/pc_keyb.c:70:
+static int aux_pole = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Lattitude' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Latitude'?
#164: FILE: drivers/char/pc_keyb.c:900:

                            ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#237: FILE: drivers/char/pc_keyb.c:1080:
+static int open_aux(struct inode * inode, struct file * file)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#239: FILE: drivers/char/pc_keyb.c:1082:
+	if (aux_count++) {
+		return 0;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#242: FILE: drivers/char/pc_keyb.c:1085:
+	queue->head = queue->tail = 0;		/* Flush input queue */

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#262: FILE: drivers/char/pc_keyb.c:1221:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "Mouse interrupt is busy,"

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#263: FILE: drivers/char/pc_keyb.c:1222:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "Mouse interrupt is busy,"
+			    " continuing in old mode\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
