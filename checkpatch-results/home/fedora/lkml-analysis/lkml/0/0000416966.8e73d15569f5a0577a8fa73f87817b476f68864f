WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'drivers' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#56: FILE: ide/ide-cd.c:1721:
+		printk("%s: %x, ptr=%p,len=%d,bio=%p\n", drive->name, rq->cmd[0], ptr, blen, rq->bio);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
