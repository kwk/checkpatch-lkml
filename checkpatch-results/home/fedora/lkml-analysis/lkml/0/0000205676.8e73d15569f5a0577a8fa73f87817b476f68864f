+                           = tp->snd_cwnd - ( tp->snd_cwnd / $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#52: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:1283:
+                           = tp->snd_cwnd - ( tp->snd_cwnd / $

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line

+                           = tp->snd_cwnd - ( tp->snd_cwnd / 

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
