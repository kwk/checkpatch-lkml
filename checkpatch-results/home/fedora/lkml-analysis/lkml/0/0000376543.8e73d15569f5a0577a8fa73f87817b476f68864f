WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'comiled' may be misspelled - perhaps 'compiled'?
#38: 
kernel/posix-timers.c can no longer be comiled with gcc 2.95, as it complains about
                                       ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#90: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:147:
+	if(err == 0) return IRQ_NONE;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#90: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:147:
+	if(err == 0) return IRQ_NONE;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#90: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:147:
+	if(err == 0) return IRQ_NONE;
[...]
 	else if(err < 0){
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#97: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:153:
+	if(tty == NULL) return IRQ_NONE;

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#97: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:153:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tty"
#97: FILE: arch/um/drivers/line.c:153:
+	if(tty == NULL) return IRQ_NONE;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#308: FILE: arch/um/include/line.h:71:
+extern irqreturn_t line_interrupt(int irq, void *data, struct pt_regs *unused);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
