WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#60: FILE: lib/cmdline.c:30:
+	upper_range = simple_strtol((*str), NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#102: FILE: lib/cmdline.c:98:
+			int range_nums;
+			range_nums = get_range((char **)&str, ints + i);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#106: FILE: lib/cmdline.c:102:
+			/* Decrement the result by one to leave out the
+			   last number in the range.  The next iteration

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#107: FILE: lib/cmdline.c:103:
+			   will handle the upper number in the range */
