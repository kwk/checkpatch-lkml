CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#110: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:472:
+		i = j = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
