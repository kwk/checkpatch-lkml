WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#52: FILE: arch/powerpc/Kconfig:397:
+config PPC_IBM_CELL_BLADE

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#290: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spu_priv1_mmio.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#295: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spu_priv1_mmio.c:6:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <spu_resource_allocation_groupID_set>
#400: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spu_priv1_mmio.c:111:
+void spu_resource_allocation_groupID_set(struct spu *spu, u64 id)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
