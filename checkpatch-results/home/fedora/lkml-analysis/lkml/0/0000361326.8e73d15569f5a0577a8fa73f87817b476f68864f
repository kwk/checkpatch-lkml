infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#46: 
--- a/drivers/pnp/support.c	Wed Jun 18 23:01:17 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#88: FILE: drivers/pnp/support.c:290:
+	mem->min = mem->max = (p[7] << 24) | (p[6] << 16) | (p[5] << 8) | p[4];

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
