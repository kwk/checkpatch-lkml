+	 * The following calls are expected to return the total number of bytes to write out, including '\0'.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#164: FILE: fs/mountfd.c:424:
+		ret = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
