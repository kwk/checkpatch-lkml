Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#84: FILE: kernel/power/pmdisk.c:2:
+ * kernel/power/pmdisk.c - Suspend-to-disk implmentation

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
