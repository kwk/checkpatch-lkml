Subject: [PATCH] sound/hda: rate-limit timeout message
                       ^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PRINTK_RATELIMITED: Prefer printk_ratelimited or pr_<level>_ratelimited to printk_ratelimit
#55: FILE: sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c:512:
+			if (printk_ratelimit())

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'azx_get_response', this function's name, in a string
#57: FILE: sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c:514:
+					"azx_get_response timeout\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
