Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#143: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_priv.h:144:
+extern void scsi_device_dev_release(struct device *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#144: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_priv.h:145:
+extern int scsi_sysfs_add_sdev(struct scsi_device *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct scsi_device *' should also have an identifier name
#144: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_priv.h:145:
+extern int scsi_sysfs_add_sdev(struct scsi_device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#155: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c:238:
+	if (get_device(&sdev->host->shost_gendev)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
