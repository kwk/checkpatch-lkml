WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#45: FILE: drivers/s390/net/qeth_main.c:3:
+ * linux/drivers/s390/net/qeth_main.c ($Revision: 1.145 $)

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.
