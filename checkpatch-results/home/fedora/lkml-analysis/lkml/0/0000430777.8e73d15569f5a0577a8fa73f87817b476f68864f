WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#73: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:475:
+	BUG_ON (max_mapnr != num_physpages);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#73: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:475:
+	BUG_ON (max_mapnr != num_physpages);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#83: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:485:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#91: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:788:
+	__flush_tlb_global();		/* Even mappings of "global" things (vmalloc) need to be fixed */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
