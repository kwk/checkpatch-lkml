are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

+		for (str = str + 6; isspace(*str); str++);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#150: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_proc.c:115:
+^Iif (strncmp(str, "range=", 6) == 0) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
