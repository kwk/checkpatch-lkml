CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.h:283:
+extern struct usb_serial *usb_serial_get_by_index (unsigned int minor);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
