Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#168: FILE: fs/Config.in:105:
+source fs/journalfs/Config.in

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
