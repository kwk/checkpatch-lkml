WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#23: FILE: include/asm-v850/bug.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#24: FILE: include/asm-v850/bug.h:2:
+ * include/asm-v850/bug.h -- Bug reporting

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#39: FILE: include/asm-v850/bug.h:17:
+extern void __bug (void) __attribute__ ((noreturn));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __noreturn over __attribute__((noreturn))
#39: FILE: include/asm-v850/bug.h:17:
+extern void __bug (void) __attribute__ ((noreturn));

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#39: FILE: include/asm-v850/bug.h:17:
+extern void __bug (void) __attribute__ ((noreturn));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void' should also have an identifier name
#39: FILE: include/asm-v850/bug.h:17:
+extern void __bug (void) __attribute__ ((noreturn));

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#40: FILE: include/asm-v850/bug.h:18:
+#define BUG()		__bug()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
