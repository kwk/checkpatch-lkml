I accidentally used wrong lkml address, so I resend it now with proper format.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "iw"
#68: FILE: net/core/net-sysfs.c:327:
+		if (iw != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#89: FILE: net/core/net-sysfs.c:464:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
