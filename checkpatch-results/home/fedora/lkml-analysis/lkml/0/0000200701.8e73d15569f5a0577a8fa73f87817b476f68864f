     The three instantiation flags are dealt with with the construction

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#57: 
Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#145: FILE: include/linux/key.h:255:
+extern void keyring_replace_payload(struct key *key, void *replacement);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#357: FILE: security/keys/key.c:973:
+	 * this type with impunity */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:MEMORY_BARRIER: memory barrier without comment
#814: FILE: security/keys/keyring.c:721:
+		wmb();

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#1281: FILE: security/keys/user_defined.c:100:
+		BUG_ON(source->datalen != spayload->datalen);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#1286: FILE: security/keys/user_defined.c:102:
+		upayload->datalen = key->datalen = spayload->datalen;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
