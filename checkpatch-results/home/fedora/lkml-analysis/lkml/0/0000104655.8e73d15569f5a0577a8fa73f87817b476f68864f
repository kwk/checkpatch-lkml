ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#51: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:500:
+	if ((err = pci_enable_device_bars(dev, dev->bar_mask)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#129: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:708:
+	int i, bar_mask = 0;
+	for (i = 0; i < PCI_NUM_RESOURCES; i++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
