ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#66: FILE: include/asm-i386/spinlock.h:135:
+static inline void _raw_spin_lock_bit(int nr, unsigned long * lock)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#138: FILE: include/linux/spinlock.h:86:
+#define spin_lock_init(lock)		do { (void)(lock); } while(0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
