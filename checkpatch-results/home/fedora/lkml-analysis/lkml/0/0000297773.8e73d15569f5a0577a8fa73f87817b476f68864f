WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#62: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:364:
+	unsigned long long sum = 0, user = 0, nice = 0, system = 0, idle = 0, iowait = 0, irq = 0, softirq = 0;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#148: FILE: include/linux/kernel_stat.h:37:
+extern unsigned long long nr_context_switches(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
