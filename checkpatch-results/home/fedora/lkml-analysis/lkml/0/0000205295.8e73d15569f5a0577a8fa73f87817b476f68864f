WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#208: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:215:
+		unsigned long sz = PAGE_SIZE - p;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#209: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:216:
+^I^I^Isz = count; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_TRANSLATE_MEM_PTR' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#276: FILE: include/asm-ia64/uaccess.h:372:
+#define ARCH_HAS_TRANSLATE_MEM_PTR	1

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#280: FILE: include/asm-ia64/uaccess.h:376:
+	char * ptr;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
