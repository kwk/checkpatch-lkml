WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#92: FILE: fs/fat/inode.c:90:
+	struct msdos_sb_info *sbi = MSDOS_SB(inode->i_sb);
+	spin_lock(&sbi->inode_hash_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#113: FILE: fs/fat/inode.c:106:
+		BUG_ON(i->vfs_inode.i_sb != sb);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#164: FILE: fs/fat/inode.c:1246:
+	if (!(bh = sb_bread(sb, i_pos >> sbi->dir_per_block_bits))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#219: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs_sb.h:30:
+#define FAT_HASH_SIZE	(1UL << FAT_HASH_BITS)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#220: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs_sb.h:31:
+#define FAT_HASH_MASK	(FAT_HASH_SIZE-1)
                      	              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment
#230: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs_sb.h:56:
+	spinlock_t inode_hash_lock;
