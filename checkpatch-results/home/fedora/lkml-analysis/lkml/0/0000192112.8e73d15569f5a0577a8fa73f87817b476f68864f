ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#29: 
--- a/Makefile	2005-04-07 11:59:01 -07:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
