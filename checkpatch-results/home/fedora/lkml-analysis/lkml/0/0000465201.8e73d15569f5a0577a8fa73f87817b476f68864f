CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:592:
+extern int pdflush_operation(void (*fn)(unsigned long), unsigned long arg0);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#88: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#89: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:2:
+ * mm/pdflush.c - worker threads for writing back filesystem data

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#105: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:18:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#134: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:47:
+static int nr_pdflush_threads = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#145: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:58:
+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'minumum' may be misspelled - perhaps 'minimum'?
#146: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:59:
+ * - The minumum and maximum number of pdflush instances are bound
          ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#162: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:75:
+	void (*fn)(unsigned long);	/* A callback function for pdflush to work on */

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'agains' may be misspelled - perhaps 'against'?

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#252: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:165:
+	struct pdflush_work my_work;
+	return __pdflush(&my_work);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!fn"
#265: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:178:
+	if (fn == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#266: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:179:
+		BUG();		/* Hard to diagnose if it's deferred */

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#291: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:204:
