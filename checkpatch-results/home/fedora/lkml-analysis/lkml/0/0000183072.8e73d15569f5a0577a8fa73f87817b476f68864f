Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:564:
+extern void partition_sched_domains(cpumask_t *partition1, 

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead

+	synchronize_sched();

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.
