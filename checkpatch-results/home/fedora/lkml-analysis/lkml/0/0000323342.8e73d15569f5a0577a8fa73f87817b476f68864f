WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#41: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:588:
+		if (atkbd_probe(atkbd)) {
+			return -EIO;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#44: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:591:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 125 exceeds 100 columns
#54: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:601:
+		atkbd->dev.ledbit[0] |= BIT(LED_COMPOSE) | BIT(LED_SUSPEND) | BIT(LED_SLEEP) | BIT(LED_MUTE) | BIT(LED_MISC);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

#65: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:612:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
