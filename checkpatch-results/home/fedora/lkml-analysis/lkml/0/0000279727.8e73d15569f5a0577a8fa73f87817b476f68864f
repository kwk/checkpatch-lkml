         ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Atleast' may be misspelled - perhaps 'At least'?
#81: 
Atleast 'warned', and possible cnt,recent should be per-array.
^^^^^^^

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix '.' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#100: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:288:
+					static int warned;
+					if (time_after(recent+HZ, jiffies))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#100: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:288:
+					if (time_after(recent+HZ, jiffies))
 					                     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#100: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:288:
+					if (time_after(recent+HZ, jiffies))
[...]
+					else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that '!' (ctx:WxW)

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#107: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:295:

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 121 exceeds 100 columns
#111: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:299:
+						printk("raid5: switching cache buffer size, %d --> %d\n", oldsize, size);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
