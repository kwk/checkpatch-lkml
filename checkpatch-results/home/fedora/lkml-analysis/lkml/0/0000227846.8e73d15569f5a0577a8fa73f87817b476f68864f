Subject: [PATCH] - Externel SLIT table information thru sysfs
                   ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#69: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:114:
+static ssize_t node_read_distance(struct sys_device * dev, char * buf)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#84: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:129:
+static SYSDEV_ATTR(distance, S_IRUGO, node_read_distance, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
