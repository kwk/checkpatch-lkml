ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#36: 
--- a/include/linux/serio.h	Sun Oct 20 04:57:23 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
