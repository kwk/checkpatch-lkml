WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#91: FILE: mm/filemap.c:727:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!page"
#122: FILE: mm/filemap.c:798:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#153: FILE: mm/filemap.c:835:
+		if (prev_index != index) {
 			mark_page_accessed(page);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#238: FILE: mm/filemap.c:1267:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
