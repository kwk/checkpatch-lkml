WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#39: 
> while :; do echo test > a; [ -s a ] || break; rm a; done; echo Out of space

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'fs' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#71: FILE: ext3/balloc.c:652:
+	 * Set current handle h_sync to allow it to be committed ASAP. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#78: FILE: ext3/balloc.c:659:
+			tid_t prev_tid = prev_trans->t_tid;
+			log_start_commit(journal, prev_trans);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
