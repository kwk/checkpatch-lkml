ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#151: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-gart.c:145:
+^I^Idma_mask = hwdev->dma_mask; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#186: FILE: drivers/net/tg3.c:6784:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
