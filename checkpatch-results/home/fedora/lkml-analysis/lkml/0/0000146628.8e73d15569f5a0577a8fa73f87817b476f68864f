#61: FILE: drivers/fc4/fc.c:358:
+			fc->cmd_slots = (fcp_cmnd **)kzalloc(slots * sizeof(fcp_cmnd*), GFP_KERNEL);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#61: FILE: drivers/fc4/fc.c:358:

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

#144: FILE: drivers/fc4/soc.c:559:
+	s = kzalloc (sizeof (struct soc), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
