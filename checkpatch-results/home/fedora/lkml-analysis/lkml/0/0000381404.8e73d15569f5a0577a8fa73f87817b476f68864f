CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#40: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:477:
+extern void		synchronize_net(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - void synchronize_net() should probably be void synchronize_net(void)
#52: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2512:
+void synchronize_net() {

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#52: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2512:
+void synchronize_net() {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#67: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2556:
+ ^Isynchronize_net();$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
