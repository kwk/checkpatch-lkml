Big benifit of this patch is it deletes a lot of unneeded code :)

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#69: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drm_sysfs.c:1:
+

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'class == NULL'
#165: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drm_sysfs.c:64:
+	if ((class == NULL) || (IS_ERR(class)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!class"
#165: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drm_sysfs.c:64:
+	if ((class == NULL) || (IS_ERR(class)))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#276: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drmP.h:1013:
+extern struct class *drm_sysfs_create(struct module *owner, char *name);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
