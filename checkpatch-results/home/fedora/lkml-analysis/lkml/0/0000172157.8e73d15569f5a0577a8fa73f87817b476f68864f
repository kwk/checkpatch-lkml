CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:68:
+extern kmem_cache_t *kmem_find_general_cachep(size_t size, unsigned int __nocast gfpflags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

+static inline void *kmalloc_node(size_t size, unsigned int __nocast flags, int node)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
