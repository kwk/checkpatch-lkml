CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided

+		sdev->scsi_level = sdev->sdev_target->scsi_level = SCSI_2;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
