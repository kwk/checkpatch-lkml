CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#408: FILE: include/linux/gfs2_ondisk.h:539:
+extern void gfs2_dinode_out(const struct gfs2_inode *ip, void *buf);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
