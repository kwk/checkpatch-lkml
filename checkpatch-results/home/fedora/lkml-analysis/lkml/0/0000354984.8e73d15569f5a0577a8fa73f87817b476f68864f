+config NETFILTER

+	depends on INET
+	---help---
+	  Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets
+	  that pass through your Linux box.
+
+	  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as
+	  a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of
+	  firewall provided by this kernel support is called a "packet
+	  filter", which means that it can reject individual network packets
+	  based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,
+	  a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
+	  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
+	  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
+	  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
+	  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
+	  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
+	  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
+	  you say Y here.
+
+	  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
+	  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
+	  globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
+	  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
+	  the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
+	  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
+	  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
+	  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
+	  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
+	  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
+	  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
+	  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
+	  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
+	  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
+	  called NAT (Network Address Translation).
+
+	  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
+	  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
+	  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
+	  typically a caching proxy server.
+
+	  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
+	  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
+	  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
+	  <file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
+	  these packages.
+
+	  Make sure to say N to "Fast switching" below if you intend to say Y
+	  here, as Fast switching currently bypasses netfilter.
+
+	  Chances are that you should say Y here if you compile a kernel which
+	  will run as a router and N for regular hosts. If unsure, say N.

+	  You can say Y here if you want to get additional messages useful in
+	  debugging the netfilter code.
