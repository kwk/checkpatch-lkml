ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#37: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c	2002-12-16 03:07:56.000000000 +0100

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#47: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:1208:
I think it would be much nicer if you had a proper stub for !CONFIG_NUMA..

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/topology.h> instead of <asm/topology.h>
#53: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:23:
+#include <asm/topology.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
