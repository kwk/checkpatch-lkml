#63: FILE: fs/9p/vfs_file.c:186:
+v9fs_file_read(struct file *filp, char __user * data, size_t count,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
