CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around '!dev->power.power_state.event'
#102: FILE: drivers/base/power/suspend.c:46:
+	if (dev->bus && dev->bus->suspend && (!dev->power.power_state.event))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#125: FILE: drivers/base/power/sysfs.c:38:
+	state.event = simple_strtoul(buf, &rest, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#154: FILE: drivers/media/video/msp3400.c:1429:
+static int msp_suspend(struct device * dev, pm_message_t state, u32 level);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
