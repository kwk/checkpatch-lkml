ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 131 exceeds 100 columns

+	dentry = debugfs_create_file(hcd->self.bus_name, S_IFREG|S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR, uhci_debugfs_root, uhci, &uhci_debug_operations);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#88: FILE: drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c:1979:
+	dentry = debugfs_create_file(hcd->self.bus_name, S_IFREG|S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR, uhci_debugfs_root, uhci, &uhci_debug_operations);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
