Please review this patch, which is targetted solely for 2.5.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#74: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:50:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#127: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:168:
+	DBGC((KERN_ERR "PCI: Bus %d, bridge: %s\n",
+		bus->number, bridge->name));

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#129: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:170:
+	DBGC((KERN_ERR "  IO window: %08lx-%08lx\n",
+		ranges.io_start, ranges.io_end));

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#131: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:172:
+	DBGC((KERN_ERR "  MEM window: %08lx-%08lx\n",
+		ranges.mem_start, ranges.mem_end));

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#133: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:174:
+	DBGC((KERN_ERR "  PREFETCH window: %08lx-%08lx\n",
+		ranges.prefetch_start, ranges.prefetch_end));

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#161: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:237:
+			b->resource[2]->start = ranges->prefetch_start =

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "b->resource[2]"
#182: FILE: drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:270:
+		ranges.prefetch_valid = b->resource[2] != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
