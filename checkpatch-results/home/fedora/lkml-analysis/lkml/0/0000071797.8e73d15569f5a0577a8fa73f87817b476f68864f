#30: 
Makes it possible for the e100 ethernet driver to have it's interrupt handler

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#56: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:1959:
+	switch(cmd)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#56: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:1959:
+	switch(cmd)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#60: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:1963:
+			return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
