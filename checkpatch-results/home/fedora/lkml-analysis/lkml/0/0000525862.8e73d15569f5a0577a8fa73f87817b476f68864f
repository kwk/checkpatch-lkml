The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

+	if (type_a == 7 && type_b == 7 && sleep_state == ACPI_STATE_S5 && !memcmp(acpi_gbl_DSDT->oem_id, "ASUS\0\0", 6)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#51: FILE: drivers/acpi/hardware/hwsleep.c:154:
+		type_a = type_b = 2;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
