hoping for, but here is a patch agains 2.4.0-test13-pre5 which
                                ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#208: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:325:
+void enforce_rss_limit(struct mm_struct * mm, int gfp_mask)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#211: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:328:
+	struct vm_area_struct* vma;

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#217: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:334:
+	address = mm->swap_address = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#225: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:342:
+^I * Find the proper vm-area after freezing the vma chain $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#408: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:111:
+extern int try_to_free_pages(int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#408: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:111:
+extern int try_to_free_pages(int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
