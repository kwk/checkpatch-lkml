WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#16: 
Subject: [PATCH 3/4] Re: [2.6-BK-URL] NTFS: Final sparse annotation/fixes.

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.
