WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#54: FILE: include/linux/ktime.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#55: FILE: include/linux/ktime.h:2:
+ *  include/linux/ktime.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'choosen' may be misspelled - perhaps 'chosen'?
#85: FILE: include/linux/ktime.h:32:

                                                   ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'substraction' may be misspelled - perhaps 'subtraction'?
#195: FILE: include/linux/ktime.h:142:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#243: FILE: include/linux/ktime.h:190:
+extern ktime_t ktime_add_ns(const ktime_t kt, u64 nsec);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#255: FILE: include/linux/ktime.h:202:
+^I^I^I   ^I   .nsec = (s32)ts.tv_nsec } };$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#255: FILE: include/linux/ktime.h:202:
