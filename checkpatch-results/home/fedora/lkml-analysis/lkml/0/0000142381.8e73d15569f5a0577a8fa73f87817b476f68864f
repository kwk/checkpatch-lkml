WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#86: FILE: include/linux/hugetlb.h:104:
+#define hugetlb_fault(mm, vma, addr, write)	({ BUG(); 0; })

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
