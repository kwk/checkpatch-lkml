Now that GCC warns about format errors, fix them. Nothing able to cause a crash,

#48: FILE: arch/um/drivers/slirp_user.c:107:
+		printk("slirp_close: process %d has not exited\n", pri->pid);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
