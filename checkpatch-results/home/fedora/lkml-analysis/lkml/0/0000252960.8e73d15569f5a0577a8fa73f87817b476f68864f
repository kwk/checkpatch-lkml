CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#284: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:916:
+		start = stop = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
