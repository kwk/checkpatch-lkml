ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

+config NETDEVICES
+	depends on NET
+	bool "Network device support"
+	---help---
+	  You can say N here if you don't intend to connect your Linux box to
+	  any other computer at all or if all your connections will be over a
+	  telephone line with a modem either via UUCP (UUCP is a protocol to
+	  forward mail and news between unix hosts over telephone lines; read
+	  the UUCP-HOWTO, available from
+	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>) or dialing up a shell
+	  account or a BBS, even using term (term is a program which gives you
+	  almost full Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up
+	  shell account on some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
+	  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>).
+
+	  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains a network card that
+	  you want to use under Linux (make sure you know its name because you
+	  will be asked for it and read the Ethernet-HOWTO (especially if you
+	  plan to use more than one network card under Linux)) or if you want
+	  to use SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol is the protocol used to
+	  send Internet traffic over telephone lines or null modem cables) or
+	  CSLIP (compressed SLIP) or PPP (Point to Point Protocol, a better
+	  and newer replacement for SLIP) or PLIP (Parallel Line Internet
+	  Protocol is mainly used to create a mini network by connecting the
+	  parallel ports of two local machines) or AX.25/KISS (protocol for
+	  sending Internet traffic over amateur radio links).
+
+	  Make sure to read the NET-3-HOWTO. Eventually, you will have to read
+	  Olaf Kirch's excellent and free book "Network Administrator's
+	  Guide", to be found in <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#guide>. If
+	  unsure, say Y.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
