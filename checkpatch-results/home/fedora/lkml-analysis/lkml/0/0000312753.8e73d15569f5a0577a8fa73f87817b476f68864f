CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#83: FILE: include/asm-i386/kgdb.h:31:
+extern void kgdb_attach(struct kgdb_hook *hook);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#107: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/kgdb_stub.c:133:
+struct kgdb_hook *kh = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#185: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/kgdb_stub.c:511:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#185: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/kgdb_stub.c:511:
+					for(i = 0; i < kh->maxsend; i++) {
+						putDebugChar(kh->sendbuf[i]);
 					}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <putDebugChar>
#186: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/kgdb_stub.c:512:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
