CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "data->pre_exec"
#55: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:45:
+	if (data->pre_exec != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'stack_out != NULL'
#71: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:63:
+	if ((stack_out != NULL) && (*stack_out != 0))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "stack_out"
#71: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:63:
+	if ((stack_out != NULL) && (*stack_out != 0))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!stack_out"
#121: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:121:
+	if (stack_out == NULL)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#149: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:146:
+	if (stack_out == NULL) {
[...]
 			       "0x%x\n", status);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
