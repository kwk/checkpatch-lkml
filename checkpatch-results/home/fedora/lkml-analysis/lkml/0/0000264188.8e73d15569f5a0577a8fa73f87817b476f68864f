CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#159: FILE: kernel/fork.c:963:
+	p->rchar = p->wchar = p->rblk = p->wblk = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
