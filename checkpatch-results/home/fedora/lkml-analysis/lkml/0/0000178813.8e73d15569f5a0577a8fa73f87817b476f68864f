#36: 
In kdump, sometimes, general driver initialization issues seems to be cropping 

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'atleast' may be misspelled - perhaps 'at least'?
#66: 
problem does not occur atleast on this machine. Attached is the serial console 
                       ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#109: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:828:
+		 * capture kernel. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
