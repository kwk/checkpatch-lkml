Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#111: FILE: gamecon.c:287:
+static void gc_psx_read_packet(struct gc *gc, unsigned char data[5][GC_PSX_BYTES], unsigned char id[5])

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#120: FILE: gamecon.c:306:
 		if((gc_status_bit[i] & (gc->pads[GC_PSX] | gc->pads[GC_DDR]))
+		   && (GC_PSX_LEN(id[i]) > max_len)

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#121: FILE: gamecon.c:307:
+		   && (GC_PSX_LEN(id[i]) > max_len)
+		   && (GC_PSX_LEN(id[i]) <= GC_PSX_BYTES))

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#125: FILE: gamecon.c:310:
+	for (i = 0; i < max_len; i++) {							/* Read in all the data */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
