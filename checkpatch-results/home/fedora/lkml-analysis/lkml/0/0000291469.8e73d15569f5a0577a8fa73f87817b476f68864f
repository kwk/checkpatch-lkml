WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#71: FILE: sound/pci/via82xx.c:87:
+int index_num, mpu_port_num, enable_num, joystick_num, ac97_clock_num, ac97_quirk_num, dxs_support_num;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:EXPORTED_WORLD_WRITABLE: Exporting writable files is usually an error. Consider more restrictive permissions.

+module_param_array(index, int, index_num, 0666);
Exporting world writable sysfs/debugfs files is usually a bad thing.
When done arbitrarily they can introduce serious security bugs.
In the past, some of the debugfs vulnerabilities would seemingly allow
any local user to write arbitrary values into device registers - a
situation from which little good can be expected to emerge.
