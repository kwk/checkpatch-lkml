WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'fs' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#30: FILE: buffer.c:1299:
+	if (size > PAGE_SIZE) BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#30: FILE: buffer.c:1299:
+	if (size > PAGE_SIZE) BUG();

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
