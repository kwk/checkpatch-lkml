WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#143: FILE: fs/namei.c:2296:
+		int error = vfs_unlink(new_nd->dentry->d_inode, new_dentry);
+		BUG_ON(error);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#143: FILE: fs/namei.c:2296:
+		BUG_ON(error);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#145: FILE: fs/namei.c:2298:
+		 * on */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

 	                                   ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
