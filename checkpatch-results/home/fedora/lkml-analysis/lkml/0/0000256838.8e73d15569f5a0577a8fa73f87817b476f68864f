ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#153: FILE: drivers/usb/core/config.c:425:
+^I^I^I^Ikref_put(&cf->intf_cache[i]->ref, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#154: FILE: drivers/usb/core/config.c:426:
+				kref_put(&cf->intf_cache[i]->ref, 
+					  usb_release_interface_cache);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#198: FILE: drivers/usb/core/usb.h:13:
+extern void usb_release_interface_cache(struct kref *ref);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#238: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:432:
+	dbg ("%s - %s", __FUNCTION__, serial->type->name);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#238: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:432:
+	dbg ("%s - %s", __FUNCTION__, serial->type->name);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "serial->port[i]->dev.parent"
#250: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:444:
+		if (serial->port[i]->dev.parent != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#257: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:451:
+	 * the driver core */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
