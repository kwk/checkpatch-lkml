ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#71: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/time.c	Tue Oct 28 10:08:52 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#95: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/time.c:112:
+		if (unlikely(time_adjust < 0)) {
[...]
+		else if (unlikely(lost))
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#100: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/time.c:117:
+^I^I} $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#101: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/time.c:118:
+		} 
+		else if (unlikely(lost))

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
