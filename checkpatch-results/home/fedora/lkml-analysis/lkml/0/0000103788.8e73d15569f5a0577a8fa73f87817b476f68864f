CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#149: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/smp.c:504:
+		__cpu_logical_map[1] = (__u16) cpu;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after additional_cpus
#168: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/smp.c:675:
+static unsigned int __initdata additional_cpus;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#177: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/smp.c:684:
+		pcpus = NR_CPUS;

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#189: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/smp.c:696:
+	additional_cpus = simple_strtoul(s, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#233: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/smp.c:869:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(cpu_online_map);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#245: FILE: include/asm-s390/smp.h:34:
+extern void smp_setup_cpu_possible_map(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
