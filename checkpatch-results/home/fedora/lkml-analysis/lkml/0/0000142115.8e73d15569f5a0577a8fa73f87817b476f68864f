Subject: [PATCH 3/9] ipmi: watchdog parms in sysfs
                                    ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#70: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:184:
+	l = simple_strtoul(val, &endp, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#131: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:245:
+	action_fn fn = (action_fn) kp->arg;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#196: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:930:
 };
+int nmi_handler_registered;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#334: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:1109:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING PFX

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#337: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:1112:
+			return;
+		} else

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#337: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:1112:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#352: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:1127:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

+		printk(KERN_INFO PFX "Unknown action '%s', defaulting to"
+		       " reset\n", action);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
