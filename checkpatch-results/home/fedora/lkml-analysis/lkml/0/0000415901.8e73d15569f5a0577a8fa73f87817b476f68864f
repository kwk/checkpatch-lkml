CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:288:
+extern void init_disk(struct gendisk *disk, int minors);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#76: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:375:
+static void disk_release(struct kobject * kobj)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#79: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:378:
+	struct gendisk *disk = to_disk(kobj);
+	if (disk->destructor)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#91: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:390:
+/* init_disk assumes disk should is initialized to all zeroes,
+   except for disk->part, which points to the partitions structures,

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#92: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:391:
+   which are also assumed to be initialized to all zeroes. */

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#128: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:410:
+		disk->part = (struct hd_struct*) &disk[1];

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
