#21: 
tty_schedule_flip() would schedule a thread that would call flush_to_ldisc().

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#66: FILE: drivers/char/hvc_console.c:658:
+	if (read_total) {
+		tty_flip_buffer_push(tty);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
