#41: 
Please find below one out of collection of patched that move NR_CPU array variables to the per-cpu area.  Please consider applying,

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#113: FILE: include/asm-i386/mmu_context.h:22:
+^I^Iper_cpu(cpu_tlbstate, cpu).state = TLBSTATE_LAZY;^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#135: FILE: include/asm-i386/mmu_context.h:53:
+		BUG_ON(per_cpu(cpu_tlbstate, cpu).active_mm != next);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
