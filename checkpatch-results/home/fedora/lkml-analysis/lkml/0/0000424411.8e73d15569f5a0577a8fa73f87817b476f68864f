CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:642:
+extern void netdev_do_link_work(struct net_device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment
#123: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:21:
+	spinlock_t lock;

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#148: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:64:
+extern int FASTCALL(cancel_work(struct work_struct *work));

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#172: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:149:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#232: FILE: net/core/dev.c:635:
+	struct net_device *dev = cookie;
+	rtnl_lock();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
