WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#95: FILE: include/linux/wireless.h:177:
+ * Don't put the name of your driver there, it's useless. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 112 exceeds 100 columns
#303: FILE: net/core/wireless.c:118:
+	{ IW_HEADER_TYPE_POINT, 0, (sizeof(struct sockaddr) + sizeof(struct iw_quality)), 0, IW_MAX_GET_SPY, 0},

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
