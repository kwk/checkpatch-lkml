WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#228: FILE: mm/swap.c:338:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(__pagevec_page_replace_add);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
