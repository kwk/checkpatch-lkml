#25: 
as modprobe (insmod) seems to have POSIX args handling, we should perhaps add "--"

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: char * array declaration might be better as static const
#40: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:136:
+	char *argv[] = { modprobe_path, "-s", "-k", "--", (char*)module_name, NULL };

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#40: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:136:
+	char *argv[] = { modprobe_path, "-s", "-k", "--", (char*)module_name, NULL };

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
