CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "do_eop_acct"
#81: FILE: kernel/exit.c:832:
+	if (do_eop_acct != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#99: FILE: include/linux/acct.h:193:
+extern void (*do_eop_acct) (int, struct task_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
