Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pipe_buf_operations should normally be const
#85: FILE: fs/pipe.c:255:
+		struct pipe_buf_operations *ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#98: FILE: fs/pipe.c:267:
+			int error;
+			if (chars > (max_write - offset))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
