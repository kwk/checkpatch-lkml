ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#46: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process.c:218:
+static int __init skas0_cmd_param(char *str, int* add)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#48: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process.c:220:
+	ptrace_faultinfo = proc_mm = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
