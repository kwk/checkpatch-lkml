ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#25: 
--- a/drivers/char/random.c	2002-08-23 12:43:20.000000000 -0500

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#44: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:603:
+static __u32 *batch_entropy_pool=0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

#53: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:611:

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#63: FILE: drivers/char/random.c:615:
+	batch_pos = batch_credit = batch_samples = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
