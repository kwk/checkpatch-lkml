Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#57: FILE: mm/filemap.c:99:
+	if (PageDirty(page)) BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#57: FILE: mm/filemap.c:99:
+	if (PageDirty(page)) BUG();

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <TryLockPage>
#66: FILE: mm/filemap.c:136:
+		if (PageDirty(page) || TryLockPage(page))

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
