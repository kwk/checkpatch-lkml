+          The User-Mode Linux port includes a driver called UBD which will let
+          you access arbitrary files on the host computer as block devices.
+          Unless you know that you do not need such virtual block devices say
+          Y here.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

+config BLK_DEV_UBD_SYNC
+	bool "Always do synchronous disk IO for UBD"
+	depends on BLK_DEV_UBD
+	---help---
+	  Writes to the virtual block device are not immediately written to the
+	  host's disk; this may cause problems if, for example, the User-Mode
+	  Linux 'Virtual Machine' uses a journalling filesystem and the host
+	  computer crashes.
+
+          Synchronous operation (i.e. always writing data to the host's disk
+          immediately) is configurable on a per-UBD basis by using a special
+          kernel command line option.  Alternatively, you can say Y here to
+          turn on synchronous operation by default for all block devices.
+
+          If you're running a journalling file system (like reiserfs, for
+          example) in your virtual machine, you will want to say Y here.  If
+          you care for the safety of the data in your virtual machine, Y is a
+          wise choice too.  In all other cases (for example, if you're just
+          playing around with User-Mode Linux) you can choose N.

+	depends on USERMODE && BROKEN
+	---help---
+          The User-Mode Linux port can provide support for IO Memory
+          emulation with this option.  This allows a host file to be
+          specified as an I/O region on the kernel command line. That file
+          will be mapped into UML's kernel address space where a driver can
+          locate it and do whatever it wants with the memory, including
+          providing an interface to it for UML processes to use.
+
+          For more information, see
+          <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/iomem.html>.
+
+          If you'd like to be able to provide a simulated IO port space for
+          User-Mode Linux processes, say Y.  If unsure, say N.
