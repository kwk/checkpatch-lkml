WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#60: FILE: include/linux/cpu_rc.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_CPU_RC_H_

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment
#87: FILE: include/linux/cpu_rc.h:28:
+	spinlock_t lock;

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#105: FILE: include/linux/cpu_rc.h:46:
+	} stat[NR_CPUS];	/* XXX  need alignment */

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#186: FILE: init/Kconfig:293:
+config CPU_RC
+	bool "CPU resource controller"
+	depends on CKRM_RES_CPU
+	help
+	  This options will let you control the CPU resource by scaling
+	  the timeslice allocated for each tasks.
+
+	  Say N if unsure.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#214: FILE: kernel/cpu_rc.c:2:
+ *  kernel/cpu_rc.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#289: FILE: kernel/cpu_rc.c:77:
+	BUG_ON(n == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#306: FILE: kernel/cpu_rc.c:94:
+^I^I} else if (load * CPU_RC_GUAR_SCALE > $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
