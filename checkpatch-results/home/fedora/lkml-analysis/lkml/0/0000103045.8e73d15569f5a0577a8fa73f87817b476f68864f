CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1220:
+extern struct sighand_struct *lock_task_sighand(struct task_struct *tsk,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#54: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1221:
+extern struct sighand_struct *lock_task_sighand(struct task_struct *tsk,
+							unsigned long *flags);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#57: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1224:
+static inline void unlock_task_sighand(struct task_struct *tsk,
+						unsigned long *flags)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sighand"
#102: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1129:
+		if (unlikely(sighand == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
