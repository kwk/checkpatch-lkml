# --------------------------------------------

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#45: FILE: drivers/pnp/pnpbios/pnpbios.h:29:
+extern void *pnpbios_kmalloc(size_t size, int f);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
