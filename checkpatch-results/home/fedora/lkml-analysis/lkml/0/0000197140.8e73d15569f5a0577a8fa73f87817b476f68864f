Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#86: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/ttusb-dec/ttusb_dec.c:1504:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#87: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/ttusb-dec/ttusb_dec.c:1505:
+	dprintk("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#89: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/ttusb-dec/ttusb_dec.c:1507:
+	/* we have to check whether the irq URB is already submitted.
+	  * As the irq is submitted after the interface is changed,

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#103: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/ttusb-dec/ttusb_dec.c:1521:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
