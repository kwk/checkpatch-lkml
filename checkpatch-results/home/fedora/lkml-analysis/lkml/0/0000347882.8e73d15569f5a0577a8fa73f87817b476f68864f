Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#84: 
--- a/drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_DAC1064.c	Wed Aug  6 19:16:11 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#120: FILE: drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_base.c:179:
+static void matroxfb_crtc1_panpos(WPMINFO2) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#133: FILE: drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_base.c:192:
+			if (extvga_reg != 0x00) {
+				mga_outb(M_EXTVGA_INDEX, extvga_reg);
+			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
