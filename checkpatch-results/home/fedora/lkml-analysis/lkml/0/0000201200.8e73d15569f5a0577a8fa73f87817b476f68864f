#52: 
The patch implements a simple rlimit ceiling for the RT (and nice) priorities

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#77: FILE: include/asm-generic/resource.h:45:
+#define RLIMIT_NICE		13	/* max nice prio allowed to raise to
+					   0-39 for nice level 19 .. -20 */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#101: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:875:
+extern int can_nice(const task_t *p, const int nice);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#121: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3316:
+	int nice_rlim = 19 - nice;
+	return (nice_rlim <= p->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_NICE].rlim_cur ||

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
