#29: 
  this patch (against 2.6.4) fixes a bug which I hit when migrating from 2.4.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#68: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:750:
+		/* If we are not the first console on this
+		   fb, copy the font from that console */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#68: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:750:
+		   fb, copy the font from that console */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#71: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:753:
+		vc->vc_font.data = p->fontdata = q->fontdata;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
