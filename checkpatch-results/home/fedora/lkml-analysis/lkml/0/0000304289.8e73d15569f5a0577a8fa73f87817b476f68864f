ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#70: FILE: pci/intel8x0.c:807:
+		static int status_ack = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#72: FILE: pci/intel8x0.c:809:
+		static int err_count = 10;
+		if (status) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
