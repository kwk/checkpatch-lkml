Subject: [PATCH] scsi: Convertion to struct scsi_cmnd in ips-driver
                       ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#79: FILE: drivers/scsi/ips.c:344:
+static void ips_scmd_buf_write(struct scsi_cmnd * scmd, void *data,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
