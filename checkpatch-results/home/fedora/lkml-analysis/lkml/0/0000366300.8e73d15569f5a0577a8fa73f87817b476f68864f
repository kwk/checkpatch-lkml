ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#180: FILE: include/linux/elevator.h:34:
+int elevator_neil_merge(request_queue_t *, struct request **, struct list_head *, struct buffer_head *, int, int);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'request_queue_t *' should also have an identifier name
#180: FILE: include/linux/elevator.h:34:
+int elevator_neil_merge(request_queue_t *, struct request **, struct list_head *, struct buffer_head *, int, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
