Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring

+						if (ret == -EIO)

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#271: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:22:
+static inline int mapping_gfp_mask(struct address_space * mapping)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
