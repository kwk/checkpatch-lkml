CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#88: FILE: mm/readahead.c:1056:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'compute_thrashing_threshold', this function's name, in a string
#170: FILE: mm/readahead.c:1138:
+	ddprintk("compute_thrashing_threshold: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#171: FILE: mm/readahead.c:1139:
+	ddprintk("compute_thrashing_threshold: "
+			"at %lu ra %lu=%lu*%lu/%lu, remain %lu for %lu\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
