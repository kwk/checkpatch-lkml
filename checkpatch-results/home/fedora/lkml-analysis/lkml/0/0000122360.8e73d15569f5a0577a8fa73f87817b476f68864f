ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'necesserily' may be misspelled - perhaps 'necessarily'?
#119: FILE: drivers/block/ub.c:620:
+ * necesserily destroy the queue. Instead, it may merely decrease q->refcnt.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {
