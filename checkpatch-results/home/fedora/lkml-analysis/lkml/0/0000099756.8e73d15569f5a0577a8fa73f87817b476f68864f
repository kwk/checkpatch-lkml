CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bases"
#93: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:527:
+	if (bases == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#107: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:541:
+		if ((node = base->first) != NULL) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 24)

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#189: FILE: kernel/timer.c:498:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#212: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:118:
+extern int hrtimer_next_jiffie(unsigned long *next_jiffie);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
