WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#63: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1717:
+/* Create an open file that refers to the null device.
+   Derived from the OpenWall LSM. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#64: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1718:
+struct file *open_devnull(void) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#64: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1718:
+struct file *open_devnull(void) 

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1744:
+	inode->i_atime = inode->i_mtime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0666'.
#104: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1758:
+	init_special_inode(inode, S_IFCHR | S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO, dev);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#147: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1807:

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
