CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#97: FILE: kernel/sys.c:949:
+		p->fsuid = p->euid = p->uid = uid;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
