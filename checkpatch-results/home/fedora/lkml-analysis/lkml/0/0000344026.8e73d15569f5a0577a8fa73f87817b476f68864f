# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#50: 
--- a/arch/i386/boot/Makefile	Tue Aug 19 23:41:17 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#117: FILE: scripts/Makefile.clean:68:
+clean := -f $(if $(KBUILD_OUTPUT),$(srctree)/)scripts/Makefile.clean obj

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
