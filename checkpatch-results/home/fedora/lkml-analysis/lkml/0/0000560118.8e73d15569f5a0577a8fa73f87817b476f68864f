CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'vma == NULL'
#61: FILE: mm/mmap.c:427:
+		if (prev->vm_end < addr &&
+				((vma == NULL) || (addr < vma->vm_end)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'addr < vma->vm_end'
#61: FILE: mm/mmap.c:427:
+		if (prev->vm_end < addr &&
+				((vma == NULL) || (addr < vma->vm_end)))

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#62: FILE: mm/mmap.c:428:
+		if (prev->vm_end < addr &&
+				((vma == NULL) || (addr < vma->vm_end)))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vma"
#62: FILE: mm/mmap.c:428:
+				((vma == NULL) || (addr < vma->vm_end)))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#75: FILE: mm/mmap.c:441:
+		struct vm_area_struct * tree = mm->mmap_avl;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
