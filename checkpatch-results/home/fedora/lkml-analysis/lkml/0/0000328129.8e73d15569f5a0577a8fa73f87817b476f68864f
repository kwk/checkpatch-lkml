#25: 
I had problems using CardBus cards in my laptop, they simply got no IRQ assigned. The kernel currently used is 2.4.22.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#51: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-irq.c:256:
+	irq >>= (pirq-1)*3;
 	             ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#59: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-irq.c:264:
+	static const int viper_irq_map[] = { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, 6, 7 };

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
