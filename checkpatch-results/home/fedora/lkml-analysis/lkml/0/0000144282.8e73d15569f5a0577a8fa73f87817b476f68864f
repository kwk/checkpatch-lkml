WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#16: 
Subject: [PATCH] sparse cleanups: NULL pointers, C99 struct init.

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!request.handle"
#63: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drm_context.c:236:
+	if (request.handle == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited before semicolon
#144: FILE: drivers/net/skfp/smt.c:1899:
+	const char	*open_paren = NULL ;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
