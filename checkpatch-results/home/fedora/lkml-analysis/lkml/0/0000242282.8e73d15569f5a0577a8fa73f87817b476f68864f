Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#88: FILE: drivers/base/interface.c:54:
+static ssize_t driver_show(struct device * dev, char * buf)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#95: FILE: drivers/base/interface.c:61:
+	int retval = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'detach_show' to 'detach_state_show' 'detach_store' to 'detach_state_store'
#104: FILE: drivers/base/interface.c:70:
+}

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#106: FILE: drivers/base/interface.c:72:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_RW: Use DEVICE_ATTR_RW
#108: FILE: drivers/base/interface.c:74:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(driver, 0644, driver_show, driver_store);

The DEVICE_ATTR_RW(name) helper macro can be used instead of
DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0644, name_show, name_store);

Note that the macro automatically appends _show and _store to the
named attribute variable of the device for the show and store methods.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes
