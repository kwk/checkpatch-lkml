Since we're not prefaulting the pages at mmap time, some extra accounting is

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#80: FILE: fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:72:
+^I * not at shmat (when the mapping is actually created) so $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#92: FILE: fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:84:
+			struct page *page = pvec.pages[i];
+			if (page->index > next)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
