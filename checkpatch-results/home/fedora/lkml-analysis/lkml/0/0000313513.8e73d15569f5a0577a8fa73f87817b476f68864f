ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#54: 
--- a/drivers/input/evdev.c	Wed Jan  7 17:12:01 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#121: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:549:
+	simple_add_class_device(&input_class, MKDEV(INPUT_MAJOR, MOUSEDEV_MINOR_BASE + MOUSEDEV_MIX),

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
