ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#36: FILE: af_unix.c:1395:
 	}
+	else {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#36: FILE: af_unix.c:1395:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#37: FILE: af_unix.c:1396:
+		((struct sockaddr *) msg->msg_name)->sa_family = AF_UNIX;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
