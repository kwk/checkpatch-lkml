WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'unneded' may be misspelled - perhaps 'unneeded'?
#31: 
Trivial cleanups, mostly static/non static, removed unneded exports.
                                                    ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#48: FILE: drivers/w1/w1.c:19:
  * Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
