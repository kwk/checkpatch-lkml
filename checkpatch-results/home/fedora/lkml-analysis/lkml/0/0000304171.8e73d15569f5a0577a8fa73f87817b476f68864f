Subject: [PATCH] propogate errors from misc_register to caller

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#32: 
The misc_register function needs to check return value of the things it calls!

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#35: 
--- a/drivers/char/misc.c	Fri Feb 13 11:15:29 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR|S_IRGRP' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0640'.
#64: FILE: drivers/char/misc.c:255:
+	err = devfs_mk_cdev(dev, S_IFCHR|S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR|S_IRGRP, 

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
