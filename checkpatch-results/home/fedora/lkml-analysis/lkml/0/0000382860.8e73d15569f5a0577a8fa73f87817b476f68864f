ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#33: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:55:
+		inode->i_mtime.tv_sec = ((struct cramfs_sb_info*)sb->s_fs_info)->fstime;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#105: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:54:
+		inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
