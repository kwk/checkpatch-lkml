Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#88: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/crash.c:42:
+	for(;;);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

distractions when editing files.
