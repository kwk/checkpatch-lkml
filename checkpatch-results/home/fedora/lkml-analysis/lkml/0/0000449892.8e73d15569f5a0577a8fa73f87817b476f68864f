CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#287: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1249:
+extern int page_symlink(struct inode *inode, const char *symname, int len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
