WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#39: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:564:
+	extern int smp_done;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#44: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:569:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "smp_call_function %p called before SMP!\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'smp_call_function', this function's name, in a string
#44: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:569:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "smp_call_function %p called before SMP!\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#58: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:1221:
+unsigned int smp_done = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
