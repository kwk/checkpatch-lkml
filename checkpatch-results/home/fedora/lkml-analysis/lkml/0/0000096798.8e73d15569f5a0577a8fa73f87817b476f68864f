BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

+static void _d_rehash(struct dentry * entry)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#280: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:210:
+extern struct dentry * d_materialise_unique(struct dentry *, struct inode *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dentry *' should also have an identifier name
#280: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:210:
+extern struct dentry * d_materialise_unique(struct dentry *, struct inode *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
