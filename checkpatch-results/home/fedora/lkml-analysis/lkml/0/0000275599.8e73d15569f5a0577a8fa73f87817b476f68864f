CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#223: FILE: include/asm-s390/uaccess.h:349:
+extern long __strncpy_from_user_asm(long count, char *dst, const char *src);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#232: FILE: include/asm-s390/uaccess.h:356:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
