#24: 
introduces get_gendisk_by_name, so this keeps the naming somewhat consistent.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#74: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:125:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(get_gendisk_by_kdev_t);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#188: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:92:
+extern struct gendisk *get_gendisk_by_kdev_t(kdev_t dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
