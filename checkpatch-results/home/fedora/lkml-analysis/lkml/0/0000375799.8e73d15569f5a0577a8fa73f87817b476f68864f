ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#90: 
--- a/include/linux/net.h	Wed Apr 23 02:57:58 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: include/linux/net.h:143:
+extern int	     net_family_get(int family);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#97: FILE: include/linux/net.h:144:
+extern void	     net_family_put(int family);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#124: FILE: net/core/sock.c:607:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#160: FILE: net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1070:
+^I/* The netlink device handler may be needed early. */ $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:INLINE: plain inline is preferred over __inline__
#193: FILE: net/socket.c:144:
+static __inline__ void net_family_bug(int family)

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#195: FILE: net/socket.c:146:
+	printk(KERN_ERR "%d is not yet sock_registered!\n", family);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#196: FILE: net/socket.c:147:
+	BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "net_families[family]"
#203: FILE: net/socket.c:154:
+	if (likely(net_families[family] != NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
