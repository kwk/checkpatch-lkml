ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#76: FILE: fat/cache.c:175:
+^I^I^Iif ((*f_clu = walk->file_cluster) == cluster) { $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#76: FILE: fat/cache.c:175:
+			if ((*f_clu = walk->file_cluster) == cluster) { 

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!last"
#103: FILE: fat/cache.c:223:
+			if (last == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
