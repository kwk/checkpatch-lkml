ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#50: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:43:
+unsigned int psmouse_rate = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#63: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:458:
+^I^Ireturn; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
