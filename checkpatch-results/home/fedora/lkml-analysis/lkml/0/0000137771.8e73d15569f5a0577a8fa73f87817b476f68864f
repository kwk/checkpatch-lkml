#24: 
[PATCH]: This modifies the gendisk and hd_struct structs to replace "policy"

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#40: FILE: drivers/block/floppy.c:3718:
+	if (UTESTF(FD_DISK_WRITABLE)) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#77: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:673:
+		if (disk->part[i]) disk->part[i]->readonly = state;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#99: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:695:
+	return (disk->readonly);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#102: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:698:

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
