WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#24: 
Subject: [PATCH] remove net driver ugliness that sparse complains about

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#478: FILE: drivers/net/pcmcia/smc91c92_cs.c:2224:
+    mii = if_mii(rq);$

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#564: FILE: include/linux/mii.h:147:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#567: FILE: include/linux/mii.h:150:
+	return (struct mii_ioctl_data *) &rq->ifr_ifru;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
