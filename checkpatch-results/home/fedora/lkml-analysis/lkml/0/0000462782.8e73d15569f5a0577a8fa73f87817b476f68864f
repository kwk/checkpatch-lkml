   It was hard enough to make this going agian at all.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#76: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:1220:
+static ide_startstop_t cdrom_start_read(struct ata_device *drive, struct ata_request *ar, unsigned int block)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#119: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:1650:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#119: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:1650:
 	if (rq->flags & REQ_CMD) {
+	

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#120: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:1651:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
