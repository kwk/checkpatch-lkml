WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#50: FILE: sound/isa/es18xx.c:1606:
+	snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_isa_pages_for_all(pcm, 64*1024, chip->dma1 > 3 || chip->dma2 > 3 ? 128*1024 : 64*1024);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
