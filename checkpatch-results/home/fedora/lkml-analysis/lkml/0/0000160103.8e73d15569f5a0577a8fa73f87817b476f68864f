#24: 
Simplify the generic arch permission checking: the previous one was clumsy, as

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#44: FILE: mm/memory.c:1926:
+static inline int check_perms(struct vm_area_struct * vma, int access_mask) {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#44: FILE: mm/memory.c:1926:
+static inline int check_perms(struct vm_area_struct * vma, int access_mask) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#47: FILE: mm/memory.c:1929:
+		 * VM_NONUNIFORM the check is skipped. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
