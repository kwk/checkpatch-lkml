Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#103: FILE: drivers/video/intelfb/intelfbdrv.c:229:
+static int hwcursor     = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#131: FILE: drivers/video/intelfb/intelfbdrv.c:648:
+		offset = ROUND_UP_TO_PAGE(MB(voffset))/GTT_PAGE_SIZE;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
