WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#183: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:77:
+static void mousedev_abs_event(struct input_handle *handle, struct mousedev_list *list, unsigned int code, int value)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#208: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:102:
+			if (list->finger >= 3) {
+				list->dx += (value - list->oldx) / 8;
+			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
