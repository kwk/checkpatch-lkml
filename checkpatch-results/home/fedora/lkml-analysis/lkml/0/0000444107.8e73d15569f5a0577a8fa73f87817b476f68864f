WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#72: FILE: fs/select.c:229:
+			struct file_operations *f_op;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#107: FILE: fs/select.c:264:
+			if (res_in) *rinp = res_in;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
