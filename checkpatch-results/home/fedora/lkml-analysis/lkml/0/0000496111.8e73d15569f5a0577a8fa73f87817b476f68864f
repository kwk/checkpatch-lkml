WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'drivers' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#45: FILE: scsi/ide-scsi.c:716:
+				BUG_ON(!sg->address);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#47: FILE: scsi/ide-scsi.c:718:
+					printk("jens was right\n");

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#51: FILE: scsi/ide-scsi.c:722:
+				offset = (unsigned long) sg->address & ~PAGE_MASK;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#53: FILE: scsi/ide-scsi.c:724:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
