CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "str"
#59: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:30:
+			if (str != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#62: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:33:

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#64: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:35:
+ ^I}$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#76: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:97:
+	char *p, *d = (char*) dm;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#76: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:97:
+	char *p, *d = (char*) dm;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p"
