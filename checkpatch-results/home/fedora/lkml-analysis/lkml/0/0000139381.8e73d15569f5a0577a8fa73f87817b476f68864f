#51: 
Try the attached. BTW, shouldn't input->id.bus be BUS_HOST and not BUS_XTKB=

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*locomokbd)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct locomokbd)...)
#125: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/locomokbd.c:201:
+	locomokbd = kzalloc(sizeof(struct locomokbd), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
