CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: include/linux/taskstats_kern.h:30:
+extern void taskstats_exit_alloc(struct taskstats **, struct taskstats **);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#115: FILE: kernel/ksysfs.c:68:
+extern ssize_t taskstats_tgid_exit_store(struct subsystem *subsys, const char *page, size_t count);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#191: FILE: kernel/taskstats.c:371:
+	char *p = (char *)page;
+	tgid_exit_send = simple_strtoul(p, &p, 10);

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#191: FILE: kernel/taskstats.c:371:
+	tgid_exit_send = simple_strtoul(p, &p, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
