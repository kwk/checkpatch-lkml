CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#78: FILE: fs/dcache.c:759:
+	unsigned long dent_addr = (unsigned long) dentry;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:WxV)
#107: FILE: fs/dcache.c:771:
+	if ((!kern_addr_valid(dent_addr)) || (!kern_addr_valid(dent_addr -1 +
 	                                                                 ^

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#123: FILE: fs/dcache.c:779:
+	lhp = base = d_hash(dparent, dentry->d_name.hash);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#196: FILE: fs/ncpfs/dir.c:337:
+		if (dent->d_name.len <= NCP_MAXPATHLEN &&
 		   (unsigned long)dent->d_fsdata == fpos) {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#269: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:220:
+extern int d_validate(struct dentry *, struct dentry *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dentry *' should also have an identifier name
#269: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:220:
+extern int d_validate(struct dentry *, struct dentry *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
