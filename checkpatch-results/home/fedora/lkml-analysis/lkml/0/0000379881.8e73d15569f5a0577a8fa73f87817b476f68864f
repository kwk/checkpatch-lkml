WARNING:DO_WHILE_MACRO_WITH_TRAILING_SEMICOLON: do {} while (0) macros should not be semicolon terminated

+#define do_sync_op(op)		do { \

do {} while(0) macros should not have a trailing semicolon.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "task"
#107: FILE: include/linux/wait.h:83:
+#define is_sync_wait(wait)	((wait)->task != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
