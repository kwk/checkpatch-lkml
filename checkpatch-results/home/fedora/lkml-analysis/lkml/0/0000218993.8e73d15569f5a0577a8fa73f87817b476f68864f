CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!notification"
#82: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:163:
+	if (notification == NULL || (mode & BTE_NOTIFY_AND_GET_POINTER)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 17)
#90: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:198:
+	if (mode & BTE_NOTIFY_AND_GET_POINTER)
+		 *(u64 volatile **)(notification) = &bte->notify;

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#91: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:199:
+		 *(u64 volatile **)(notification) = &bte->notify;

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around bte_zero_notify[node]
#107: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:465:
+	return *(bte_zero_notify[node]) != BTE_WORD_BUSY;

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#115: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:473:
+	/* Check limitations.
+		1. System must be running (weird things happen during bootup)

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#130: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:488:
+void sn_bte_bzero_init(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#141: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/setup.c:246:
+	extern void sn_bte_bzero_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
