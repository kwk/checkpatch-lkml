CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#76: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_nv.c:523:
+	ppi[0] = ppi[1] = &nv_port_info[ent->driver_data];

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
