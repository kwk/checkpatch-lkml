WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'dissagreement' may be misspelled - perhaps 'disagreement'?
#36: 
fs/udf has a function type dissagreement. It is not critical for me
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Defice' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Device'?
#182: FILE: include/scsi/scsi.h:217:

                          ^^^^^^

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#216: FILE: fs/udf/udfdecl.h:153:
+extern unsigned long udf_get_last_block(struct super_block *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct super_block *' should also have an identifier name
#216: FILE: fs/udf/udfdecl.h:153:
+extern unsigned long udf_get_last_block(struct super_block *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
