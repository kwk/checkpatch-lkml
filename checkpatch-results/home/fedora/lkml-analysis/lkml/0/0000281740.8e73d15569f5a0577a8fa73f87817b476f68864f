WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IXGRP' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0010'.
#100: FILE: fs/exec.c:896:
+		if ((mode & (S_ISGID | S_IXGRP)) == (S_ISGID | S_IXGRP)) {

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:NON_OCTAL_PERMISSIONS: Use 4 digit octal (0777) not decimal permissions
#131: FILE: security/commoncap.c:29:
+module_param(newcaps, int, 444);
Permission bits should use 4 digit octal permissions (like 0700 or 0444).
Avoid using any other base like decimal.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#238: FILE: security/commoncap.c:216:
+		is_setuid = is_setgid = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#259: FILE: security/commoncap.c:237:
+	if (is_setuid) {
+	        current->suid = current->euid = current->fsuid = bprm->e_uid;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
