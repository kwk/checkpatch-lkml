#26: 
This patch addresses a problem with clustering software and also some of our utilies. We had to modify the modify the open specifically for clustering. This is the same as was done for 2.4. We also have to register the reserved volumes with the OS so when the backup server breaks the reservations he can call BLKRRPART to set the volume to the correct size.
