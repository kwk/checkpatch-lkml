+	bool "Network packet filtering (replaces ipchains)"
+	---help---
+	  Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets
+	  that pass through your Linux box.
+
+	  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as
+	  a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of
+	  firewall provided by this kernel support is called a "packet
+	  filter", which means that it can reject individual network packets
+	  based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,
+	  a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
+	  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
+	  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
+	  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
+	  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
+	  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
+	  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
+	  you say Y here.
+
+	  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
+	  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
+	  globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
+	  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
+	  the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
+	  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
+	  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
+	  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
+	  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
+	  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
+	  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
+	  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
+	  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
+	  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
+	  called NAT (Network Address Translation).
+
+	  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
+	  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
+	  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
+	  typically a caching proxy server.
+
+	  Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using
+	  a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables "see"
+	  the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet
+	  protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter
+	  configuration).
+
+	  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
+	  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
+	  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
+	  <file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
+	  these packages.
+
+	  Make sure to say N to "Fast switching" below if you intend to say Y
+	  here, as Fast switching currently bypasses netfilter.
+
+	  Chances are that you should say Y here if you compile a kernel which
+	  will run as a router and N for regular hosts. If unsure, say N.
+
+if NETFILTER
+
+config NETFILTER_DEBUG
+	bool "Network packet filtering debugging"
+	depends on NETFILTER
+	help
+	  You can say Y here if you want to get additional messages useful in
+	  debugging the netfilter code.
+
+config BRIDGE_NETFILTER
+	bool "Bridged IP/ARP packets filtering"
+	depends on BRIDGE && NETFILTER && INET
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  Enabling this option will let arptables resp. iptables see bridged
+	  ARP resp. IP traffic. If you want a bridging firewall, you probably
+	  want this option enabled.
+	  Enabling or disabling this option doesn't enable or disable
+	  ebtables.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.

#450: FILE: net/Kconfig:500:
+config BRIDGE
+	tristate "802.1d Ethernet Bridging"
+	---help---
+	  If you say Y here, then your Linux box will be able to act as an
+	  Ethernet bridge, which means that the different Ethernet segments it
+	  is connected to will appear as one Ethernet to the participants.
+	  Several such bridges can work together to create even larger
+	  networks of Ethernets using the IEEE 802.1 spanning tree algorithm.
+	  As this is a standard, Linux bridges will cooperate properly with
+	  other third party bridge products.
+
+	  In order to use the Ethernet bridge, you'll need the bridge
+	  configuration tools; see <file:Documentation/networking/bridge.txt>
+	  for location. Please read the Bridge mini-HOWTO for more
+	  information.
+
+	  If you enable iptables support along with the bridge support then you
+	  turn your bridge into a bridging IP firewall.
+	  iptables will then see the IP packets being bridged, so you need to
+	  take this into account when setting up your firewall rules.
+	  Enabling arptables support when bridging will let arptables see
+	  bridged ARP traffic in the arptables FORWARD chain.
+
+	  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module
+	  will be called bridge.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config VLAN_8021Q
+	tristate "802.1Q VLAN Support"
+	---help---
+	  Select this and you will be able to create 802.1Q VLAN interfaces
+	  on your ethernet interfaces.  802.1Q VLAN supports almost
+	  everything a regular ethernet interface does, including
+	  firewalling, bridging, and of course IP traffic.  You will need
+	  the 'vconfig' tool from the VLAN project in order to effectively
+	  use VLANs.  See the VLAN web page for more information:
+	  <http://www.candelatech.com/~greear/vlan.html>

+
+config NET_DIVERT
+	bool "Frame Diverter (EXPERIMENTAL)"
+	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
+	---help---
+	  The Frame Diverter allows you to divert packets from the
+	  network, that are not aimed at the interface receiving it (in
+	  promisc. mode). Typically, a Linux box setup as an Ethernet bridge
+	  with the Frames Diverter on, can do some *really* transparent www
+	  caching using a Squid proxy for example.
+
+	  This is very useful when you don't want to change your router's
+	  config (or if you simply don't have access to it).
+
+	  The other possible usages of diverting Ethernet Frames are
+	  numberous:
+	  - reroute smtp traffic to another interface
+	  - traffic-shape certain network streams
+	  - transparently proxy smtp connections
+	  - etc...
