Subject: Re: [patch 2/4 with proper signed-off] crypto/sha512.c: fix sparse warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#44: FILE: crypto/sha512.c:108:
+	W[I] = __be64_to_cpu( ((__be64*)(input))[I] );

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
