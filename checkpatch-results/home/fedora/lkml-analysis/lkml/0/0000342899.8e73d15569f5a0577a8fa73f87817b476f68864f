WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#85: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c:44:
+extern int acpi_irq;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#94: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c:411:
+	if (acpi_disabled || !acpi_irq) {
 		return 1;
         }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
