IOW, 2/11 got patch from 11/11 added to its tail. Sorry. Correct (== truncated)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#146: FILE: fs/super.c:944:
+		struct super_block *old = sb_entry(p);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
