WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#38: 
Signed-Off-By: Alasdair G Kergon <agk@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#48: FILE: drivers/md/dm-raid1.c:109:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#51: FILE: drivers/md/dm-raid1.c:112:
+ *---------------------------------------------------------------*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
