SEGV_MAYBE_FIXABLE tests ptrace_faultinfo, and depends on it being 1 only in

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#45: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:161:
+ * SEGV_MAYBE_FIXABLE */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#46: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:162:
+#define clear_can_do_skas() do { ptrace_faultinfo = proc_mm = 0; } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
