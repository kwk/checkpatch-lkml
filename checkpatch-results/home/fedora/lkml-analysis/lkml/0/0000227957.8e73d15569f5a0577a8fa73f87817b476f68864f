ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#38: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:479:
+void do_flush_tlb_all(void* info)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#49: FILE: include/asm-i386/tlbflush.h:85:
+#define local_flush_tlb_all() __flush_tlb_all();

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: include/asm-i386/tlbflush.h:118:
+extern void do_flush_tlb_all(void * info);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
