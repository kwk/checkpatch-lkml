            ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#106: FILE: kernel/sched.c:160:
+static inline void __enqueue_task(struct task_struct *p, prio_array_t *array, task_t * parent)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#117: FILE: kernel/sched.c:169:
+		array = p->array = parent->array;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#130: FILE: kernel/sched.c:201:
+static inline void __activate_task(task_t *p, runqueue_t *rq, task_t * parent)

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#159: FILE: kernel/sched.c:339:
+	task_t * parent = current;
