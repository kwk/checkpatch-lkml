WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#36: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .1
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#77: FILE: drivers/base/cpu.c:144:
+struct sys_device *get_cpu_sysdev(unsigned cpu)

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#298: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:315:
+			/*fallthrough*/

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#323: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:230:
+	struct sysfs_dirent * parent_sd;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#370: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:35:
+extern struct sys_device *get_cpu_sysdev(unsigned cpu);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#370: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:35:
+extern struct sys_device *get_cpu_sysdev(unsigned cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <R1BIO_Returned>
#383: FILE: include/linux/raid/raid1.h:133:
+#define	R1BIO_Returned 6

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
