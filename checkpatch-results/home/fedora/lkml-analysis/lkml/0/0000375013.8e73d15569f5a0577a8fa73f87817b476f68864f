#27: 
With the recent devfs surgery disk_name has become useable
                                                   ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#44: FILE: fs/partitions/check.c:124:
+	int part = MINOR(bdev->bd_dev) - bdev->bd_disk->first_minor;
+	return disk_name(bdev->bd_disk, part, buf);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1070:
+extern const char *bdevname(struct block_device *bdev, char *buffer);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
