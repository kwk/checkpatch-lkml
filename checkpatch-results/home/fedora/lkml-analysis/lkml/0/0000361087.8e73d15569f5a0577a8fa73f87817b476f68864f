Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#112: FILE: fs/aio.c:1125:
+		if (!ret && !to.timed_out && ctx->reqs_active) {
+			schedule();
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#122: FILE: fs/aio.c:1135:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
