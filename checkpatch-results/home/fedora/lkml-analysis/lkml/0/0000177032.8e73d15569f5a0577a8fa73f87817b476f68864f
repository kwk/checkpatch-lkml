#37: 
No problem. I apologize if I stepped on anyone's toes by using EXPORT_SYMBOL

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#58: FILE: fs/inode.c:1059:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(generic_drop_inode);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1414:
+extern void generic_drop_inode(struct inode *inode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
