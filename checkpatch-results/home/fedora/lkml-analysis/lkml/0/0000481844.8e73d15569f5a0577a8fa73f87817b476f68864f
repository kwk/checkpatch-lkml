CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

+static inline unsigned int double_lock_balance(runqueue_t *this_rq,
+	runqueue_t *busiest, int this_cpu, int idle, unsigned int nr_running)

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'this_rq->nr_running > this_rq->prev_nr_running[this_cpu]'
#83: FILE: kernel/sched.c:377:
+			if (idle || (this_rq->nr_running > this_rq->prev_nr_running[this_cpu]))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
