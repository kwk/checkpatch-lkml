ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#43: FILE: drivers/media/video/zr36120.c:1477:
+		unsigned long pfn = virt_to_phys((void*)pos) >> PAGE_SHIFT;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
