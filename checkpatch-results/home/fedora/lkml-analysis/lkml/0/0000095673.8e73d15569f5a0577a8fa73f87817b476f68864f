WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Use a single space after Cc:
#49: 
Cc:	Linux Kernel list <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#112: FILE: drivers/media/video/bttv-risc.c:56:
+	   region may be smaller than PAGE_SIZE */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#122: FILE: drivers/media/video/bttv-risc.c:109:
+	BUG_ON(4 * (risc->jmp - risc->cpu + 2) > risc->size);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
