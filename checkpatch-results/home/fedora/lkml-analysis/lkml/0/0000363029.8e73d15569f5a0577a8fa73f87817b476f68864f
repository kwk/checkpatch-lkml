Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#128: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:582:

+	if (q->batch_owner[rw] == tsk)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
