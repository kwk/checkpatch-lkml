ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#116: FILE: drivers/video/neofb.c:93:
+static int libretto = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'var->xres > par->NeoPanelWidth'

+	if (par->internal_display &&
+            ((var->xres > par->NeoPanelWidth) ||
+	     (var->yres > par->NeoPanelHeight))) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

#136: FILE: drivers/video/neofb.c:569:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#164: FILE: drivers/video/neofb.c:581:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinitdata is unnecessary

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __devinitdata should be placed after neofb_var800x480x8
#226: FILE: drivers/video/neofb.c:1481:
+static struct fb_var_screeninfo __devinitdata neofb_var800x480x8 = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
