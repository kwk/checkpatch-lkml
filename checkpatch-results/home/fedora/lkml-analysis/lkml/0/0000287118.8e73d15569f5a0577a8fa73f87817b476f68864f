ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#52: 
--- a/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt	Tue Apr 20 23:11:25 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'psmouse->type >= PSMOUSE_GENPS'
#96: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:68:
+	if (psmouse->pktcnt < 3 + (psmouse->type >= PSMOUSE_GENPS))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {

#174: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:704:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
