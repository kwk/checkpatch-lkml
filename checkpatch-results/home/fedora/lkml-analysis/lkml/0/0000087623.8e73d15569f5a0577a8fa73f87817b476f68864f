Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#71: FILE: net/ipv4/fib_trie.c:355:
+	if(IS_LEAF(tn)) {
[...]
+        else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'call_rcu_bh', prefer 'call_rcu' instead
#73: FILE: net/ipv4/fib_trie.c:357:
+		call_rcu_bh(&l->rcu, __leaf_free_rcu);

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#75: FILE: net/ipv4/fib_trie.c:359:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
