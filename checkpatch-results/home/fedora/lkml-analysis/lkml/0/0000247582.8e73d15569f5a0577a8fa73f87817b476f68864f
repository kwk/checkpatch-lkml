CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: fs/cachefs/cachefs-int.h:203:
+extern int cachefs_ujnl_check_barrier_cap(struct cachefs_super *super);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#145: FILE: fs/cachefs/journal.c:1689:
+	*(int*) bio->bi_private = error;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#183: FILE: fs/cachefs/journal.c:1727:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
