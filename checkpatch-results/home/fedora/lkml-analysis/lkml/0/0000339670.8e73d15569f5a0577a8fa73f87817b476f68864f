ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#32: 
--- a/net/unix/af_unix.c	Thu Sep  4 10:35:58 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#61: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1815:
+^I^Iif (off == pos) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#68: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1822:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#74: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1826:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#93: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1845:
+{
+	

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#156: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1882:
+struct seq_operations unix_seq_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
