ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#55: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:2710:
+	rdev = (void*)raid_bi->bi_next;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
