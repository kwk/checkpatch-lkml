#103: FILE: drivers/sound/i810_audio.c:1927:
+			/* hopefully nobody else destroys count so we can use it for this purpose

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#131: FILE: drivers/sound/i810_audio.c:2347:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
