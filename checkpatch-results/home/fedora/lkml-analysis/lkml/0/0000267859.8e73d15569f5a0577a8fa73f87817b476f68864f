#31: 
The first patch adds a function similiar to schedule_delayed_work to
                                ^^^^^^^^

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#51: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:67:
+extern int schedule_delayed_work_on(int cpu, struct work_struct *work, unsigned long delay);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#64: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:402:
+int schedule_delayed_work_on(int cpu,
+			struct work_struct *work, unsigned long delay)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#70: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:408:
+		BUG_ON(timer_pending(timer));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#190: FILE: mm/slab.c:2684:
+		schedule_delayed_work(&__get_cpu_var(reap_work), REAPTIMEOUT_CPUC + smp_processor_id());

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
