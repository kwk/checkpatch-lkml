CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*a3d)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct a3d)...)
#70: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/a3d.c:274:
+	a3d = kzalloc(sizeof(struct a3d), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

+		input_dev->absbit[0] |= BIT(ABS_X) | BIT(ABS_Y) | BIT(ABS_THROTTLE) | BIT(ABS_RUDDER)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
