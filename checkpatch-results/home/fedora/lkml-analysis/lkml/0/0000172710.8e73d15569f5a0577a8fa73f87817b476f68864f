CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#66: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c:440:
+			else { /* if we _WERE_ tuned, but now don't have a lock */

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#69: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c:443:
+				 * sometimes works around problems with noisy power supplies */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'fepriv->tone == SEC_TONE_ON'
#70: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c:444:
+				if (fe->ops->set_tone && (fepriv->tone == SEC_TONE_ON)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
