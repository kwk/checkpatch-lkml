#92: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:65:
+static irqreturn_t	(*kgdbeth_irqhandler)(int, void *, struct pt_regs *) = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#95: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:68:

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
