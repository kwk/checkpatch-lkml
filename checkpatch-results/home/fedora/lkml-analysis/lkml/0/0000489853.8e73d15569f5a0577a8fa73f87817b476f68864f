CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#430: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:152:
+extern void expire_task(struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#524: FILE: kernel/sched.c:97:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#551: FILE: kernel/sched.c:317:
+	if (p->dyn_prio > MAX_DYNPRIO) p->dyn_prio = MAX_DYNPRIO;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#561: FILE: kernel/sched.c:532:
+	if (!p->time_slice)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
