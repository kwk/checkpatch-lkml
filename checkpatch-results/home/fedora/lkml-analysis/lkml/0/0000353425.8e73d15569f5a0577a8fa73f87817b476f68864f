+	  Enable the possibilty of suspendig machine. It doesn't need APM.
+	  You may suspend your machine by 'swsusp' or 'shutdown -z <time>' 
+	  (patch for sysvinit needed). 
+
+	  It creates an image which is saved in your active swaps. By the next
+	  booting the, pass 'resume=/path/to/your/swap/file' and kernel will 
+	  detect the saved image, restore the memory from
+	  it and then it continues to run as before you've suspended.
+	  If you don't want the previous state to continue use the 'noresume'
+	  kernel option. However note that your partitions will be fsck'd and
+	  you must re-mkswap your swap partitions/files.
+
+	  Right now you may boot without resuming and then later resume but
+	  in meantime you cannot use those swap partitions/files which were
+	  involved in suspending. Also in this case there is a risk that buffers
+	  on disk won't match with saved ones.
+
+	  SMP is supported ``as-is''. There's a code for it but doesn't work.
+	  There have been problems reported relating SCSI.
+
+	  This option is about getting stable. However there is still some
+	  absence of features.
+
+	  For more information take a look at Documentation/swsusp.txt.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
