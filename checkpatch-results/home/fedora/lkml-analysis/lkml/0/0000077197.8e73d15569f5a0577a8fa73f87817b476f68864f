   This makes read and write more symetric.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix '.' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#50: FILE: drivers/md/bitmap.c:251:
+							  * quietly no-op */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
