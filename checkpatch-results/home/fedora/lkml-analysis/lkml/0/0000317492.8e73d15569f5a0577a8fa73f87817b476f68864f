#44: 
Move some fork related scheduler policy from fork.c to sched.c where it belongs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#59: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:583:
+extern void FASTCALL(sched_fork(task_t * p));

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:583:
+extern void FASTCALL(sched_fork(task_t * p));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#121: FILE: kernel/sched.c:688:
+        p->time_slice = (current->time_slice + 1) >> 1;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#121: FILE: kernel/sched.c:688:
+        p->time_slice = (current->time_slice + 1) >> 1;$

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#129: FILE: kernel/sched.c:696:
+	if (!current->time_slice) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
