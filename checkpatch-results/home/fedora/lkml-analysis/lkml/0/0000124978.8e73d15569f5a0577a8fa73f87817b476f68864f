WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#36: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .5
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#70: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/irq.c:30:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#152: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:1025:
+		struct completion wait;
+		init_completion(&wait);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#199: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:1072:
+		error = parse_table(name, nlen, oldval, oldlenp,
 					newval, newlen, head->ctl_table,

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#255: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:1333:
+static void register_proc_table(ctl_table * table, struct proc_dir_entry *root, void *set)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#323: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:1433:
+		table = (struct ctl_table *) de->data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:INDENTED_LABEL: labels should not be indented

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
