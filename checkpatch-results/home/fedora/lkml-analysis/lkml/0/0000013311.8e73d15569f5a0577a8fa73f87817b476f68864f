WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 123 exceeds 100 columns
#55: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:1303:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "Unable to create device for framebuffer %d; errno = %ld\n", i, PTR_ERR(fb_info->dev));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern int fb_init_device(struct fb_info *fb_info);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
