WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 135 exceeds 100 columns

+#if (MAY_SATTR | MAY_TRUNC | MAY_LOCK | MAX_OWNER_OVERRIDE | MAY_LOCAL_ACCESS) & (MAY_READ | MAY_WRITE | MAY_EXEC | MAY_OWNER_OVERRIDE)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
