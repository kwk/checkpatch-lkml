ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#229: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:876:
+static int bmsg_count = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#245: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:913:
+			if (bounce) kstat.bounceout += count;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
