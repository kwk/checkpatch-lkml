CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#119: FILE: include/net/addrconf.h:73:
+extern int                      ipv6_generate_eui64(u8 *eui, struct net_device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
