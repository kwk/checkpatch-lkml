Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*tmp)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct arch_saveable_page)...)

+		tmp = kzalloc(sizeof(struct arch_saveable_page), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
