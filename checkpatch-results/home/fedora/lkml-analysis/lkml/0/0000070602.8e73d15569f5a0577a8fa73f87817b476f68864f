CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*ns)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct ipc_namespace)...)
#95: FILE: ipc/util.c:62:
+	ns = kmalloc(sizeof(struct ipc_namespace), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ns"
#96: FILE: ipc/util.c:63:
+	if (ns == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#194: FILE: ipc/util.c:161:
+	BUG(); /* init_ipc_ns should never be put */

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#206: FILE: ipc/util.c:191:
+void __ipc_init ipc_init_ids(struct ipc_ids* ids, int size)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#237: FILE: ipc/util.c:771:
+		if ((ipc = ipc_lock(ids, p)) != NULL) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#265: FILE: ipc/util.c:810:
+		if ((ipc = ipc_lock(ids, p)) != NULL) {
