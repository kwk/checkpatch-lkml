#25: 
Avoid chomping low bits of address for functions doing it by themselves, fix

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#119: FILE: arch/um/kernel/trap_kern.c:157:
+		BUG_ON(err != -EFAULT);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
