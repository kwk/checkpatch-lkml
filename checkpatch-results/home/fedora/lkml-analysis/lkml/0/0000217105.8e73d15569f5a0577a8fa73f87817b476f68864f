Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#89: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:741:
+extern unsigned long nice_to_rlimit_nice(const int nice);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'nice' may be better as '(nice)' to avoid precedence issues
#103: FILE: kernel/sched.c:79:
+#define NICE_TO_RLIMIT_NICE(nice)	(19 - nice)

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
