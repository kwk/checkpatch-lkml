Here's a per-node kswapd.  It's actually per-pg_data_t, but I guess that they're 

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "zones[i]"
#77: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:348:
+	for (i = 0; zones[i] != NULL; i++) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#79: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:350:
+		struct zone *z = zones[i];
+		if (z->free_pages <= z->pages_low &&

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#91: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:841:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#166: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:783:
+	pg_data_t *pgdat = (pg_data_t*)p;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'kswapd', this function's name, in a string
#172: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:788:
+	sprintf(tsk->comm, "kswapd%d", pgdat->node_id);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
