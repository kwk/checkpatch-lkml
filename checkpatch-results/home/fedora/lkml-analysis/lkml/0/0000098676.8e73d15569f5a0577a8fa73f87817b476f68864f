ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#93: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:510:
process,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#97: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:511:
+static int proc_fd_access_allowed(struct inode *inode)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#125: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:523:
+		int alive;
+		task_lock(task);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
