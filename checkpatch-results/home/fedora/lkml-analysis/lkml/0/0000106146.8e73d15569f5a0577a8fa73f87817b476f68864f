CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#184: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:316:
+	switch (constrained_alloc(zonelist, gfp_mask)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#247: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:150:
+extern void out_of_memory(struct zonelist *zonelist, gfp_t gfp_mask, int order);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
