CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rb_node"
#50: FILE: drivers/block/cfq-iosched.c:153:
+#define RB_EMPTY(node)	((node)->rb_node == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#127: FILE: drivers/block/cfq-iosched.c:403:
+		BUG_ON(q->last_merge == &rq->queuelist);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
