WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#153: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/machine_kexec.c:202:
+	BUG_ON(!page);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#260: FILE: include/linux/kexec.h:101:
+extern struct page *kimage_alloc_control_page(struct kimage *image);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
