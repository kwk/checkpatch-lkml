CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'intrLine == 6'
#52: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:2038:
+	if (pc98 && (CONFIGB(pb) == 0x14d) && (intrLine == 6))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <intrLine>
#52: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:2038:
+	if (pc98 && (CONFIGB(pb) == 0x14d) && (intrLine == 6))

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#89: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:3049:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
