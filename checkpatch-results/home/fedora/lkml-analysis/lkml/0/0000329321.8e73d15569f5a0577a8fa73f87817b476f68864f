CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!skb"
#87: FILE: net/ipv4/igmp.c:290:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#98: FILE: net/ipv4/igmp.c:300:
+	skb->nh.iph = pip = (struct iphdr *)skb_put(skb, sizeof(struct iphdr)+4);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
