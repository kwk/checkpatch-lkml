ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#77: FILE: arch/ppc/syslib/prom_init.c:447:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#80: FILE: arch/ppc/syslib/prom_init.c:450:
+		phandle p;
+		p = call_prom("instance-to-package", 1, 1, prom_stdout);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
