CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:709:
+extern unsigned int nr_used_zone_pages(struct zone **);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct zone **' should also have an identifier name
#65: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:709:
+extern unsigned int nr_used_zone_pages(struct zone **);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#84: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:833:
+		struct zone * zone = *zones;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#85: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:834:
+		struct zone * zone = *zones;
+		zones++;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
