CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*fq)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct frag_queue)...)
#61: FILE: net/ipv6/reassembly.c:206:
+	struct frag_queue *fq = kzalloc(sizeof(struct frag_queue), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '&' (ctx:VxV)
#94: FILE: net/ipv6/reassembly.c:304:
+	if (!(fq->last_in&FIRST_IN) || !fq->fragments)
 	                 ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#96: FILE: net/ipv6/reassembly.c:306:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iif' may be misspelled - perhaps 'if'?
#97: FILE: net/ipv6/reassembly.c:307:
+	dev = dev_get_by_index(fq->iif);
 	                           ^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#102: FILE: net/ipv6/reassembly.c:312:
+	/*
+	   But use as source device on which LAST ARRIVED

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
