[PATCH] PCI Hotplug: pcihp_skeleton: fix delete bug and add release() callback

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");
