CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#95: FILE: sound/core/memalloc.c:180:
+	if ((res = (void *) __get_free_pages(gfp_flags, pg)) != NULL)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#95: FILE: sound/core/memalloc.c:180:
+	if ((res = (void *) __get_free_pages(gfp_flags, pg)) != NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "res"
#117: FILE: sound/core/memalloc.c:224:
+	if (res != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
