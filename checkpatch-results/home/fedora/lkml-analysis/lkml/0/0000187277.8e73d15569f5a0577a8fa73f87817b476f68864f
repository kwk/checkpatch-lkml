CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#169: FILE: drivers/chat/tpm/tpm.h:39:
+extern ssize_t tpm_show_pubek(struct device *, char *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct device *' should also have an identifier name
#169: FILE: drivers/chat/tpm/tpm.h:39:
+extern ssize_t tpm_show_pubek(struct device *, char *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.

spaces are never used for indentation.

#175: FILE: drivers/chat/tpm/tpm.h:45:
+        __ATTR(pubek, S_IRUGO, tpm_show_pubek, NULL), \

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
