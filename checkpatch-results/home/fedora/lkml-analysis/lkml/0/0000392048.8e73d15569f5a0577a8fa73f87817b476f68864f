ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#29: 
--- a/include/linux/security.h	Wed Feb 19 15:38:30 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

+extern int cap_syslog (int type);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#35: FILE: include/linux/security.h:51:
+extern int cap_syslog (int type);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
