ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#64: FILE: drivers/base/interface.c:59:
+	struct device * dev;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev->driver"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_RW: Use DEVICE_ATTR_RW

The DEVICE_ATTR_RW(name) helper macro can be used instead of
DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0644, name_show, name_store);

Note that the macro automatically appends _show and _store to the
named attribute variable of the device for the show and store methods.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
