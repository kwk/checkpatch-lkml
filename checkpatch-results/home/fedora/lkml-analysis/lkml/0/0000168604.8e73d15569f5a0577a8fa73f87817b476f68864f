Signed-Off-By: Alasdair G Kergon <agk@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'lock_fs', this function's name, in a string
#169: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:992:
+		DMWARN("bdget failed in lock_fs");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
