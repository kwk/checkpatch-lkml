CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#181: FILE: arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_cpufreq.c:195:
+	udelay(100);

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/timers/timers-howto.html#delays-information-on-the-various-kernel-delay-sleep-mechanisms

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#561: FILE: include/asm-ppc/open_pic.h:59:
+extern u_int openpic_get_priority(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#572: FILE: include/asm-ppc/reg.h:184:
+#define HID1_PS		(1<<16)		/* 750FX PLL selection */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
