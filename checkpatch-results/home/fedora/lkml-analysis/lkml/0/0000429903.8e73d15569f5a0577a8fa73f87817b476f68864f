ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#97: 
--- a/kernel/module.c	Wed Sep 25 14:18:41 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#104: FILE: kernel/module.c:55:
+^I.name ^I^I^I= "",$

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#114: FILE: kernel/module.c:1311:
+address_to_exported_symbol(unsigned long address, const char **mod_name, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#124: FILE: kernel/module.c:1320:
+		/* walk the symbol list of this module. Only symbols
+		   who's address is smaller than the searched for address

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'this_mod->syms[i].value <= address'
#127: FILE: kernel/module.c:1323:
+			if ((this_mod->syms[i].value <= address) &&
+			    (*sym_start < this_mod->syms[i].value)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#133: FILE: kernel/module.c:1329:
+					*sym_end = this_mod->syms[i+1].value;
 					                           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#135: FILE: kernel/module.c:1331:
+					*sym_end = (unsigned long) this_mod + this_mod->size;

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 150 exceeds 100 columns
#177: FILE: kernel/module.c:1350:
+	if (!kallsyms_address_to_symbol(address, &mod_name, &mod_start, &mod_end, &sec_name, &sec_start, &sec_end, &sym_name, &sym_start, &sym_end)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
