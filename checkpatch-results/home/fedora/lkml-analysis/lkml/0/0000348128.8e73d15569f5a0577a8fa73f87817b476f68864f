ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#81: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/irq.c:561:
+cpumask_t irq_affinity [NR_IRQS];

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#133: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/time.c:448:
+		tb = ((unsigned long long) hi << 32) | lo;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#141: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/time.c:456:
+		tb = ((unsigned long long) hi) * 1000000000 + lo;

WARNING:INLINE: plain inline is preferred over __inline__
#152: FILE: include/asm-ppc/time.h:100:
+extern __inline__ unsigned long get_rtcu(void)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#155: FILE: include/asm-ppc/time.h:103:
+	unsigned long rtcu;
+	asm volatile("mfrtcu %0" : "=r" (rtcu));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
