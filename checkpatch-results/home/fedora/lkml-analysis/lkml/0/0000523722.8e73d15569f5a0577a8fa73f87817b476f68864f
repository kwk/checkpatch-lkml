Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#117: FILE: include/linux/rwsem-spinlock.h:57:
+extern int FASTCALL(__down_read_trylock(struct rw_semaphore *sem));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'down_read_trylock', this function's name, in a string
#135: FILE: include/linux/rwsem.h:54:
+	rwsemtrace(sem,"Entering down_read_trylock");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
