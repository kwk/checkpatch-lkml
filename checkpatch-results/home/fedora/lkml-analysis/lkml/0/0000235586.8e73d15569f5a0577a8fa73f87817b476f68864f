+static ssize_t drvctl_store(struct device * dev, const char * buf, size_t count)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#72: FILE: drivers/base/interface.c:55:
+	int retval = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'detach_show' to 'detach_state_show' 'detach_store' to 'detach_state_store'
#81: FILE: drivers/base/interface.c:64:
+}

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_WO: Use DEVICE_ATTR_WO
#85: FILE: drivers/base/interface.c:68:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(drvctl, 0200, NULL, drvctl_store);

The DEVICE_AATR_WO(name) helper macro can be used instead of
DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0200, NULL, name_store);

Note that the macro automatically appends _store to the
named attribute variable of the device for the store method.
