#21: 
Difference from 2.5.7-dj1: folded in review comments to inline the functions

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#178: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c:170:
+	if (!atomic_add_negative(sleepers, &sem->count)) {
+		wake_up_locked(&sem->wait);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#194: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:472:
+extern void FASTCALL(__wake_up_locked(wait_queue_head_t *q, unsigned int mode));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#202: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:489:
+#define wake_up_locked(x)		__wake_up_locked((x),TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE | TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"

+						   wait_queue_t * wait)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
