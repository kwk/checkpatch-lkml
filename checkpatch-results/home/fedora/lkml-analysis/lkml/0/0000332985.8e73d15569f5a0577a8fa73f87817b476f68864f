WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#117: FILE: procfs.c:489:
+	struct super_block *s = de->parent->data;
+	if (v == NULL || !IS_ERR(v))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!v"
#117: FILE: procfs.c:489:
+	if (v == NULL || !IS_ERR(v))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
