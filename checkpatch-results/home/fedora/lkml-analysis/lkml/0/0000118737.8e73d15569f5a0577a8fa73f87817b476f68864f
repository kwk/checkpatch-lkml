CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#123: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:530:
 {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#179: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:644:
+	if ((ret = enqueue_hrtimer(timer, new_base)) && queue)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#193: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:658:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
