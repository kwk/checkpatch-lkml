Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#257: FILE: fs/filesystems.c:43:
+struct afs_linkage *afs_linkage = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#263: FILE: fs/filesystems.c:49:
+	int ret = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#267: FILE: fs/filesystems.c:53:
+	if (afs_linkage) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#281: FILE: include/linux/afs_interface.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#282: FILE: include/linux/afs_interface.h:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
