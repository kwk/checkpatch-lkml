#29: 
This patch allows a person to not require mounting a root device at startup.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#52: FILE: init/do_mounts.c:384:

+               goto out;
+       }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#53: FILE: init/do_mounts.c:385:
+               goto out;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
