WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#121: FILE: sound/core/oss/pcm_oss.c:341:
+	snd_pcm_hw_param_near(substream, sparams, SNDRV_PCM_HW_PARAM_CHANNELS, runtime->oss.channels, 0);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
