WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: arguments for function declarations should follow identifier
#167: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1202:
+unsigned int __sched schedule_timeout_msecs_interruptible

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#174: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1209:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(schedule_timeout_msecs_interruptible);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
