WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#33: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#38: FILE: kernel/power/encryption.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#80: FILE: kernel/power/encryption.c:43:
+static u8 *page_buffer = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#83: FILE: kernel/power/encryption.c:46:

                                                     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#84: FILE: kernel/power/encryption.c:47:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
