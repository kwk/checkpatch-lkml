CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: include/net/xfrm.h:341:
+extern void secpath_destroy_noop(struct sec_path *sp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#101: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:1223:
+secpath_destroy_noop (struct sec_path *sp)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
