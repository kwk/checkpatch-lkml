WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#36: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/Kconfig:52:
+config HW_RANDOM_VIA
+	tristate "VIA HW Random Number Generator support"
+	depends on HW_RANDOM && X86
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  This driver provides kernel-side support for the Random Number
+	  Generator hardware found on VIA based motherboards.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called via-rng.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#62: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/via-rng.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#92: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/via-rng.c:31:
+#include <asm/io.h>

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/cpufeature.h> instead of <asm/cpufeature.h>
#94: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/via-rng.c:33:
+#include <asm/cpufeature.h>

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#96: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/via-rng.c:35:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#99: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/via-rng.c:38:

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'xstore', this function's name, in a string
#135: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/via-rng.c:74:
+	asm(".byte 0x0F,0xA7,0xC0 /* xstore %%edi (addr=%0) */"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that ':' (ctx:ExV)
#136: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/via-rng.c:75:
+		:"=m"(*addr), "=a"(eax_out)
 		^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that ':' (ctx:ExV)
#137: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/via-rng.c:76:

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'close'
#182: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/via-rng.c:121:
+	/* Control the RNG via MSR.  Tread lightly and pay very close
+	 * close attention to values written, as the reserved fields

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#199: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/via-rng.c:138:
+	/* perhaps-unnecessary sanity check; remove after testing if
+	   unneeded */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
