ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#81: 
--- a/drivers/pci/quirks.c	Sat Apr  3 23:30:49 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#87: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:871:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#97: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:881:
+#define OHCI_OCR		(1 << 3)	/* ownership change request */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#98: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:882:
+#define OHCI_CTRL_IR		(1 << 8)	/* interrupt routing */

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#99: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:883:
+#define OHCI_INTR_OC		(1 << 30)	/* ownership change */

CHECK:ARCH_DEFINES: architecture specific defines should be avoided
#101: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:885:
+#if defined(__i386__) || defined(__x86_64__)

Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever
possible.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#104: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:888:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:ONE_SEMICOLON: Statements terminations use 1 semicolon

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#109: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:893:
+^I^Ifor (i = 0; i < PCI_ROM_RESOURCE; i++) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#121: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:905:
+       ^I^Ischedule_timeout((HZ*50+999) / 1000);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#121: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:905:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#121: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:905:

        		                    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#132: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:916:
+		if (base == NULL) return;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!base"
#132: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:916:
+		if (base == NULL) return;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

#158: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1048:
+	{ PCI_FIXUP_FINAL,	PCI_ANY_ID,		PCI_ANY_ID,			quirk_usb_disable_smm_bios },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
