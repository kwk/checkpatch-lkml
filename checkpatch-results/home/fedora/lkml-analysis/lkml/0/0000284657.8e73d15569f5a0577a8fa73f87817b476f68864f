#57: 
a closed source operating system right?  Lets not let closed source code sneak 

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#79: FILE: kernel/module.c:1135:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "%s: module has non-GPL license (%s) kernel is now tainted.\n", mod->name, license);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
