WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#487: FILE: include/asm-generic/signal.h:1:
+#ifndef _ASM_GENERIC_SIGNAL_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#492: FILE: include/asm-generic/signal.h:6:
+/* Most things should be clean enough to redefine this at will, if care
+   is taken to make libc match.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:TABSTOP: Statements should start on a tabstop

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#675: FILE: include/asm-generic/signal.h:189:
+	  void (*_sa_sigaction)(int, struct siginfo *, void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct siginfo *' should also have an identifier name
