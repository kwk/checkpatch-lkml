Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#45: FILE: page_alloc.c:456:
+                       if (!try_to_free_pages(gfp_mask));$

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#45: FILE: page_alloc.c:456:
+                       if (!try_to_free_pages(gfp_mask));
+                               return NULL;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#45: FILE: page_alloc.c:456:
+                       if (!try_to_free_pages(gfp_mask));

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
