#25: 
This patch is some hackery-quackery to fix a problem with drivers/video/vesafb.c.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (7, 15)
#50: FILE: drivers/video/vesafb.c:552:
        if (ypan || pmi_setpal) {
+               pmi_base  = (unsigned short*)phys_to_virt(((unsigned long)screen_info.vesapm_seg << 4) + screen_info.vesapm_off);

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 128 exceeds 100 columns
#52: FILE: drivers/video/vesafb.c:553:
+               pmi_base  = (unsigned short*)phys_to_virt(((unsigned long)screen_info.vesapm_seg << 4) + screen_info.vesapm_off);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#52: FILE: drivers/video/vesafb.c:553:
+               pmi_base  = (unsigned short*)phys_to_virt(((unsigned long)screen_info.vesapm_seg << 4) + screen_info.vesapm_off);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#52: FILE: drivers/video/vesafb.c:553:

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"

+               pmi_base  = (unsigned short*)phys_to_virt(((unsigned long)screen_info.vesapm_seg << 4) + screen_info.vesapm_off);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
