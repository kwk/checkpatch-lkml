ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#57: 
--- a/drivers/ide/pci/pdc202xx_old.c	Tue Feb  3 19:45:42 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <pdc_old_enable_66MHz_clock>
#70: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/pdc202xx_old.c:371:
+static void pdc_old_enable_66MHz_clock(ide_hwif_t *hwif)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#180: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/pdc202xx_old.c:754:
+	hwif->drives[0].autotune = hwif->drives[1].autotune = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
