Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#126: FILE: drivers/alsa/alsa_driver.c:1192:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#127: FILE: drivers/alsa/alsa_driver.c:1193:
+			static unsigned int xruntrace_count = 0;
+			if ((xruntrace_count++ % 1) == 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
