CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!kobject_name"
#48: FILE: lib/kobject.c:75:
+		if (kobject_name(parent) == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#49: FILE: lib/kobject.c:76:
+			printk("get_kobj_path_length: encountered NULL name\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'get_kobj_path_length', this function's name, in a string
#49: FILE: lib/kobject.c:76:
+			printk("get_kobj_path_length: encountered NULL name\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
