WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#39: 
>> +static int __generic_cont_expand(struct inode *inode, loff_t size, int dont_do_that)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#124: FILE: fs/fat/file.c:138:
+	inode->i_ctime = inode->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME_SEC;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#223: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2214:
+	/* ugh.  in prepare/commit_write, if from==to==start of block, we
+	** skip the prepare.  make sure we never send an offset for the start

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
