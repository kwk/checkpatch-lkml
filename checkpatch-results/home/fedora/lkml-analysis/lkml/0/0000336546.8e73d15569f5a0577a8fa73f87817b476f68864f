+    { 0x4c4e, 0x4c4e, 0x00, 0x00, m64n_mob_a,   230,  83, 50, M64F_GT | M64F_INTEGRATED | M64F_RESET_3D | M64F_GTB_DSP | M64F_MOBIL_BUS | M64F_EXTRA_BRIGHT},

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
