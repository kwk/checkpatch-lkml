WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#98: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/proc.c:20:
+	extern int phys_proc_id[NR_CPUS];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
