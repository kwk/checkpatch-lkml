ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#144: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c:830:
+	struct pnp_id * id = kcalloc(1, sizeof(struct pnp_id), GFP_KERNEL);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#153: FILE: drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c:866:
+		if ((card = kcalloc(1, sizeof(struct pnp_card), GFP_KERNEL)) == NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
