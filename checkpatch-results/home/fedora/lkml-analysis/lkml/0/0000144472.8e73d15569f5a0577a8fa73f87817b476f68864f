Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.
