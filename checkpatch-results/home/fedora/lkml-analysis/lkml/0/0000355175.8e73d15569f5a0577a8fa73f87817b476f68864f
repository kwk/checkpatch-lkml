CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#131: FILE: include/asm-alpha/poll.h:16:
+#define POLLRDONCE	(1 << 12)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:NETWORKING_BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: networking block comments don't use an empty /* line, use /* Comment...
#358: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp.c:440:
+	/*
+	 * RCV_SHUTDOWN is always set when an EOF condition becomes pending.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#365: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp.c:447:
 	if ((1 << sk->sk_state) & ~(TCPF_SYN_SENT | TCPF_SYN_RECV)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#425: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1797:
+		if (mask == 0 && sk->sk_type == SOCK_STREAM
+		    && sk->sk_rcvlowat == INT_MAX)
