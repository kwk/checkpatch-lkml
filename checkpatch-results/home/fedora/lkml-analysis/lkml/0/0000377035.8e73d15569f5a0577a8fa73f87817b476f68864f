WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#36: FILE: include/linux/console.h:99:
+       int     (*read)(struct console *, char *, unsigned);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct console *' should also have an identifier name
#36: FILE: include/linux/console.h:99:
+       int     (*read)(struct console *, char *, unsigned);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char *' should also have an identifier name
