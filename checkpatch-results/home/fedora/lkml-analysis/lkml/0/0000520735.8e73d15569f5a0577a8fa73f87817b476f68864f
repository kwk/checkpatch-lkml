CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#79: FILE: mm/shmem.c:758:
+	buf->f_bavail = buf->f_bfree = sb->u.shmem_sb.free_blocks;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
