ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#89: FILE: drivers/sound/opl3sa2.c:342:
+static void opl3sa2_mixer_restore(opl3sa2_mixerdata* devc, int card)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#122: FILE: drivers/sound/opl3sa2.c:932:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':

  default:

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#189: FILE: drivers/sound/opl3sa2.c:1079:
+			} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
