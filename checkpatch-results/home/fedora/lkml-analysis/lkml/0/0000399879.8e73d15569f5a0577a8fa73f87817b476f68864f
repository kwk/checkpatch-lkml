ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#39: 
--- a/include/linux/string.h	Mon Nov 18 10:33:57 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: include/linux/string.h:20:
+extern void *kmemdup(const void *, __kernel_size_t, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const void *' should also have an identifier name
#53: FILE: include/linux/string.h:20:
+extern void *kmemdup(const void *, __kernel_size_t, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument '__kernel_size_t' should also have an identifier name
#53: FILE: include/linux/string.h:20:
+extern void *kmemdup(const void *, __kernel_size_t, int);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#53: FILE: include/linux/string.h:20:
+extern void *kmemdup(const void *, __kernel_size_t, int);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#54: FILE: include/linux/string.h:21:
+  $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#54: FILE: include/linux/string.h:21:
+  $

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#97: FILE: lib/string.c:516:
+	void *p = kmalloc(n, flags);
+	if (p)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
