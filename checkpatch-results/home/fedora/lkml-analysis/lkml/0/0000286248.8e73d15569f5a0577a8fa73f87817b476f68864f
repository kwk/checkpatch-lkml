CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#89: FILE: cs.c:339:
+	skt->card_dev = dev = kmalloc(sizeof(struct device), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*dev)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct device)...)
#89: FILE: cs.c:339:
+	skt->card_dev = dev = kmalloc(sizeof(struct device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#91: FILE: cs.c:341:
+	if (dev) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#131: FILE: cs.c:637:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
