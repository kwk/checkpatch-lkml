WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'teh' may be misspelled - perhaps 'the'?
#38: 
Also fixes a "teh" typo in a comment.
              ^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#195: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:300:
+int register_clocksource(struct clocksource*);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#252: FILE: kernel/time/clocksource.c:159:
+		printk("register_clocksource: Cannot register %s. "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'register_clocksource', this function's name, in a string
#252: FILE: kernel/time/clocksource.c:159:
+		printk("register_clocksource: Cannot register %s. "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#253: FILE: kernel/time/clocksource.c:160:
+		printk("register_clocksource: Cannot register %s. "
+			"Already registered!", c->name);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
