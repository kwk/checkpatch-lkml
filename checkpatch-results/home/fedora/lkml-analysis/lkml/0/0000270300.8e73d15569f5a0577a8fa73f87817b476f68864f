Signed-Off-By: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#178: FILE: ipc/util.c:290:
+struct ipc_rcu_hdr
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#184: FILE: ipc/util.c:296:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around grace->data[0]
#257: FILE: ipc/util.c:375:
+			container_of(&(grace->data[0]), struct ipc_rcu_sched, data[0]);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#291: FILE: ipc/util.c:401:
+		call_rcu(&container_of(ptr, struct ipc_rcu_grace, data)->rcu,
+				ipc_schedule_free);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#297: FILE: ipc/util.c:404:

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#326: FILE: ipc/util.h:49:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
