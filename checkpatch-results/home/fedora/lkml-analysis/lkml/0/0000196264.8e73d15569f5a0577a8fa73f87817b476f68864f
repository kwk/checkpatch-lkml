CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#142: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/pgtable.h:476:
+extern pgprot_t phys_mem_access_prot(struct file *file, unsigned long addr,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#253: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pci.c:405:
+	if (mmap_state != pci_mmap_mem)
[...]
+	else if (write_combine == 0) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
