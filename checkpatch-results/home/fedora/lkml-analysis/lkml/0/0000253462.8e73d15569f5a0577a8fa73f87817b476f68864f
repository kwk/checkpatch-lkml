WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#188: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042-x86ia64io.h:1:
+#ifndef _I8042_X86IA64IO_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ARCH_DEFINES: architecture specific defines should be avoided
#253: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042-x86ia64io.h:66:

Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever
possible.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after i8042_dmi_table[]
#257: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042-x86ia64io.h:70:
+static struct dmi_system_id __initdata i8042_dmi_table[] = {

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
