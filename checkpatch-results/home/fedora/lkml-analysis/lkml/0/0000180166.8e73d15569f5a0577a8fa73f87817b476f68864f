WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#53: 
#define atm_info(instance, format, arg...)	\

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#94: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/speedtch.c:507:
+		atm_warn(instance->usbatm, "%s\n", "Too many failures - disabling line status polling");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
