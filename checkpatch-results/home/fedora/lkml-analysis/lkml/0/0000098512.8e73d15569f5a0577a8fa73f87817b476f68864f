CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p->policy == SCHED_RR'
#272: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2765:
+		if ((p->policy == SCHED_RR) && p->time_slice < NS_TICK) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#331: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2896:
+	int time_slice = NS_TO_JIFFIES(p->time_slice) ? : 1;
+	return time_slice * (100 - sd->per_cpu_gain) / 100;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#392: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3190:
+		next->timestamp = rq->timestamp_last_switch = now;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
