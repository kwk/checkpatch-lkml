> team, I took a look at the repport. My knowledge is somewhat limited but
                             ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#134: FILE: i2c-dev.c:233:
+		data_ptrs = (u8 **) kmalloc(rdwr_arg.nmsgs * sizeof(u8 *),

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_CASTS: unnecessary cast may hide bugs, see http://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html
#134: FILE: i2c-dev.c:233:
+		data_ptrs = (u8 **) kmalloc(rdwr_arg.nmsgs * sizeof(u8 *),

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!data_ptrs"
#136: FILE: i2c-dev.c:235:
+		if (data_ptrs == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
