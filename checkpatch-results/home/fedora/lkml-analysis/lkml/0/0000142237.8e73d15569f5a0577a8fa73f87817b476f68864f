The function wanting to evict pages must first build a list of pages to be evicted

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#61: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:182:
+extern int swapout_pages(struct list_head *l);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
