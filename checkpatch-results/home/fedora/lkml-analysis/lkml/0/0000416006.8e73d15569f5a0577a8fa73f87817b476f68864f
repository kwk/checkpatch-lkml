#32: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:516:
+int hugetlb_sysctl_handler(ctl_table *table, int write, struct file *file, void *buffer, size_t *length)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
