Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#120: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:526:
+static struct file_operations fuse_direct_io_file_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#140: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:549:
+	if (fc->flags & FUSE_DIRECT_IO)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
