WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#78: FILE: arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_pci.c:53:
+extern int pcibios_assign_bus_offset;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
