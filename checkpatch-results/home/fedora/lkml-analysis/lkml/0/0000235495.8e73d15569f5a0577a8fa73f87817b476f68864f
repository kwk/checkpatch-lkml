CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:348:
+extern int rt_task(task_t *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'task_t *' should also have an identifier name
#78: FILE: include/linux/scheduler.h:3:
+	int (*rt_task)(task_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#92: FILE: kernel/sched.c:297:
+	return (unlikely((p)->prio < MAX_RT_PRIO));

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
