#34: 
  Signed-off-by: Dmitry Torokhov <dtor@mail.ru>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#79: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:51:
+static unsigned tap_time = 200;

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#116: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:240:
+		mousedev->touch = mousedev->pkt_count = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#118: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:242:
+	}
+	else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#136: FILE: drivers/input/mousedev.c:270:
+				if (code == BTN_TOUCH && test_bit(BTN_TOOL_FINGER, handle->dev->keybit))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
