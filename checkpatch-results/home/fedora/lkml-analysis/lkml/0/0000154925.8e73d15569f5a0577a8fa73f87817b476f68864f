WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#73: FILE: fs/fuse/file.c:15:
+static struct file_operations fuse_direct_io_file_operations;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#198: FILE: include/linux/fuse.h:72:
+#define FOPEN_DIRECT_IO		(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#199: FILE: include/linux/fuse.h:73:
+#define FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE	(1 << 1)
