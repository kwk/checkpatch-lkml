WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#24: 
1. Two things in this file, first an unrelated issue (but included in the patch)

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#160: FILE: mm/swap.c:210:
+	if (jiffies_now != jiffies_at_prev_update)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Substract' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Subtract'?

 		   ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 142 exceeds 100 columns
#171: FILE: mm/swap.c:221:
+		int diff = (elapsed * (memory_clock - old) + (MEMORY_CLOCK_WINDOW * HZ + elapsed - 1)) / (MEMORY_CLOCK_WINDOW * HZ + elapsed);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#172: FILE: mm/swap.c:222:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 112 exceeds 100 columns
#173: FILE: mm/swap.c:223:
+		/* new can NEVER pass memory_clock since this is the only place were it is changed if the values

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#174: FILE: mm/swap.c:224:
+		 * are close but it will sooner or later catch up with it */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#200: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:253:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
