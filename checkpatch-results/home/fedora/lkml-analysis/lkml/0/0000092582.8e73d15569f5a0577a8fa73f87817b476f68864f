ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#42: 
--- a/drivers/acpi/utils.c	Sat Mar 18 08:35:34 2006 -0500

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#51: FILE: drivers/acpi/utils.c:275:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#52: FILE: drivers/acpi/utils.c:276:
+	  printk(KERN_INFO PREFIX "acpi_evaluate_integer: Faking _TMP\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'acpi_evaluate_integer', this function's name, in a string
#52: FILE: drivers/acpi/utils.c:276:
+	  printk(KERN_INFO PREFIX "acpi_evaluate_integer: Faking _TMP\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
