ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#36: 
--- a/drivers/net/arcnet/arc-rimi.c	Wed Jun 25 16:18:27 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#70: FILE: drivers/net/arcnet/arc-rimi.c:119:
+	if (retval < 0) {
+		release_mem_region(dev->mem_start, BUFFER_SIZE);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
