WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#74: FILE: drivers/usb/core/devio.c:1129:
+	return proc_do_submiturb(ps, &uurb, ((struct usbdevfs_urb32 __user *)arg)->iso_frame_desc, arg);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
