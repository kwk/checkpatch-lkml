ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#126: FILE: kernel/fork.c:610:
+^Imm->hiwater_vm = mm->total_vm;^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#165: FILE: mm/memory.c:1100:
+		if (PageReserved(old_page)) {
[...]
+			update_mem_hiwater();
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#363: FILE: include/linux/acct.h:123:
+extern void acct_update_integrals(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
