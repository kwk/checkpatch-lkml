WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#127: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:770:
+extern int can_nice(const task_t *p, const int nice);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#147: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3133:
+^Ireturn (nice_rlim <= p->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_NICE].rlim_cur || $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#147: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3133:
+	int nice_rlim = 19 - nice;
+	return (nice_rlim <= p->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_NICE].rlim_cur || 

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
