CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#97: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1270:
+extern void refrigerator(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#106: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1276:
+	if (freezing(current)) {
[...]
 	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p->state == TASK_TRACED'
#189: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:71:
+			if ((frozen(p)) ||
 			    (p->state == TASK_TRACED) ||
 			    (p->state == TASK_STOPPED))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p->state == TASK_STOPPED'
#189: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:71:

 			    (p->state == TASK_STOPPED))

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
