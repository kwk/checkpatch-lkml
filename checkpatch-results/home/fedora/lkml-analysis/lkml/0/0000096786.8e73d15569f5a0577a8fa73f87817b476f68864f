#79: FILE: include/net/sock.h:546:
+	int                     *sockets_allocated;     /* Current number of sockets (percpu counter). */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: include/net/sock.h:582:
+extern int read_sockets_allocated(struct proto *prot);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#130: FILE: net/core/sock.c:1458:
+	int cpu;
+	for_each_cpu(cpu)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#135: FILE: net/core/sock.c:1463:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(read_sockets_allocated);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "proto->sockets_allocated"
#153: FILE: net/core/sock.c:1642:
+		   proto->sockets_allocated != NULL ? read_sockets_allocated(proto) : -1,

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'tcp_init', this function's name, in a string
#202: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp.c:2060:
+		panic("tcp_init: Cannot alloc tcp_sockets_allocated");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
