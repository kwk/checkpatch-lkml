CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#120: FILE: include/asm-generic/bitops/hweight.h:4:
+extern unsigned int hweight32(unsigned int w);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
