WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#152: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:608:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#247: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:736:

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#282: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:179:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
