#87: FILE: fs/buffer.c:64:

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long *' should also have an identifier name
#224: FILE: include/linux/wait.h:145:
+wait_queue_head_t *FASTCALL(bit_waitqueue(unsigned long *, int));

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
