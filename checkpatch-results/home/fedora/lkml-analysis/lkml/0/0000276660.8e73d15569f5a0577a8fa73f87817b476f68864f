ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#149: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:398:
+		if (irq) dbg("Interrupt %d, without any data", irq);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#179: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:408:
+		if (str & I8042_STR_MUXERR) {
[...]
+		} else dfl = 0;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#180: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:409:
+			switch (data) {
+				case 0xfd:
+				case 0xfe: dfl = SERIO_TIMEOUT; break;
+				case 0xff: dfl = SERIO_PARITY; break;

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }
