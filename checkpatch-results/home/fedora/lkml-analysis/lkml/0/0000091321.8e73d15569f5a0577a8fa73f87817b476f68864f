ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.

  * Foundation,Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

#130: FILE: fs/ntfs/unistr.c:282:
+				} /* else if (wc_len < 0 ||
+						o >= NTFS_MAX_NAME_LEN) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
