WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#240: FILE: mm/readahead.c:1829:
+	BUG_ON(!mapping); /* QUESTION: in what case mapping will be NULL ? */

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#283: FILE: mm/readahead.c:1872:
+		if (refcnt == page_refcnt(page))
[...]
+		else if (refcnt < page_refcnt(page))
[...]
+		else if (i < 1)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'save_chunk', this function's name, in a string
#377: FILE: mm/readahead.c:1966:
+		ddprintk("save_chunk(ino=%lu, idx=%lu-%lu, %s@%s:%s)"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

#378: FILE: mm/readahead.c:1967:

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
