CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'rcall' may be misspelled - perhaps 'recall'?

 			      ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#90: FILE: fs/9p/mux.c:265:
+		if(tcall->id != TVERSION)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#121: FILE: fs/9p/mux.c:345:
+		req = rptr = rreq = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#146: FILE: fs/9p/mux.c:369:
+			struct v9fs_rpcreq *treq = NULL;
+			list_for_each_entry_safe(treq, rptr, &v9ses->mux_fcalls, next) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
