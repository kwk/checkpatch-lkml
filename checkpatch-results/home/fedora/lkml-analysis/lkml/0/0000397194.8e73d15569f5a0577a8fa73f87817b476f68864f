#26: 
Ok, after a second look, 2.4.20 seem correct. Here's a patch against 2.4.21-pre3

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#79: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-dma.c:286:
+			if (((unsigned long) bh->b_data) < PAGE_SIZE)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#80: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-dma.c:287:
+				BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
