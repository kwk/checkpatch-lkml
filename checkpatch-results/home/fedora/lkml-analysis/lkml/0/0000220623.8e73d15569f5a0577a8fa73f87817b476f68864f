CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#99: FILE: include/asm-sparc64/page.h:17:
+extern void _clear_page(void *page, unsigned long order);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
#100: FILE: include/asm-sparc64/page.h:18:
+#define clear_page(X,Y)	_clear_page((void *)(X),(Y))
                     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
