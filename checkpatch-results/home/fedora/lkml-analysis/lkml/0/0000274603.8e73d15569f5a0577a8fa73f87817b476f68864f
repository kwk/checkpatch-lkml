WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#71: FILE: mm/shmem.c:172:
+static struct vm_operations_struct shmem_zero_vm_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#87: FILE: mm/shmem.c:1107:
+		int error;
+		error = shmem_acct_size(SHMEM_I(inode)->flags, vm_size - i_size);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
