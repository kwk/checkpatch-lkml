ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#67: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:929:
+	if (ledstate != 0xff && kbd_ledfunc != NULL) kbd_ledfunc(ledstate);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "kbd_ledfunc"
#67: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:929:
+	if (ledstate != 0xff && kbd_ledfunc != NULL) kbd_ledfunc(ledstate);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#100: FILE: include/linux/kbd_kern.h:75:
+extern void kbd_refresh_leds(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
