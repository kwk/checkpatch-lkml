WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#153: FILE: kernel/kprobes.c:170:
+ * 	- with preemption disabled - from arch/xxx/kernel/kprobes.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
