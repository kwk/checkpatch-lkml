CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#304: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:181:
+extern void fastcall end_page_fs_misc(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#328: FILE: mm/filemap.c:590:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#333: FILE: mm/filemap.c:595:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(end_page_fs_misc);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
