CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/notifier.h:27:
+extern int notifier_call_chain_safe(struct notifier_block **n, unsigned long val, void *v);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
