WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#121: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usbatm.c:1260:
+	if (instance->thread);
+		kthread_stop(instance->thread);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#121: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usbatm.c:1260:
+	if (instance->thread);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
