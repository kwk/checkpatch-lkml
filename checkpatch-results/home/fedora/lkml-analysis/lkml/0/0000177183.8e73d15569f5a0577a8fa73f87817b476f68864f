Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'stop_ptraced_child', this function's name, in a string
#89: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process.c:191:
+		panic("stop_ptraced_child : ptrace failed, errno = %d", errno);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
