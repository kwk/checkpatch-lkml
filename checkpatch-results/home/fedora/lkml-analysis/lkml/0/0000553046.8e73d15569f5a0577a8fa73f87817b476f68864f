spaces are never used for indentation.

#269: FILE: maestro3.c:2912:

It is generally desirable that building the same source code with
the same set of tools is reproducible, i.e. the output is always
exactly the same.

The kernel does *not* use the ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros,
and enables warnings if they are used as they can lead to
non-deterministic builds.
