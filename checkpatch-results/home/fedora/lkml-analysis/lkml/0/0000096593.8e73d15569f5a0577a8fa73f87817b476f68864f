Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
