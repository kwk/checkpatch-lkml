WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#107: FILE: fs/ntfs/attrib.c:1017:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#127: FILE: fs/ntfs/attrib.c:1037:
+				(filler_t*)mapping->a_ops->readpage, NULL);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#177: FILE: fs/ntfs/attrib.c:1087:
+			bh = head = page_buffers(page);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'uptodate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'up-to-date'?
#182: FILE: fs/ntfs/attrib.c:1092:

#227: FILE: fs/ntfs/attrib.h:89:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
