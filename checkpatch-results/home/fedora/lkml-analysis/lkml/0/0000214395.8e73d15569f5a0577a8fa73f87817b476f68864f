WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct fb_ops should normally be const
#46: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:877:
+	struct fb_ops *fb = info->fbops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#48: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:879:
+	int ret;
+	if (fb->fb_compat_ioctl == NULL)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!fb->fb_compat_ioctl"
#48: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:879:
+	if (fb->fb_compat_ioctl == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#78: FILE: include/linux/fb.h:588:
+	int (*fb_compat_ioctl)(struct file *f, unsigned cmd, unsigned long arg,
