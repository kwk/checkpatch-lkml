Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#316: FILE: fs/namei.c:445:
+		struct vfsmount *mounted = lookup_mnt(*mnt, *dentry);
+		if (!mounted) 

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
