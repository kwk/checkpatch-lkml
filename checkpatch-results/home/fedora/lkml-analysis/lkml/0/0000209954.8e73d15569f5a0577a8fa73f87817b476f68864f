WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#142: FILE: include/linux/shmem_fs.h:43:
+int shmem_permission(struct inode *, int, struct nameidata *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#191: FILE: mm/shmem_acl.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#192: FILE: mm/shmem_acl.c:2:
+ * mm/shmem_acl.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
