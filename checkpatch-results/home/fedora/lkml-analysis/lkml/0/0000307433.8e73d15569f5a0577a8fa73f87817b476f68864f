ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#92: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c	Sat Jan 31 12:21:04 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
