#23: 
In 2.5.26 handle_sysrq() "lost" a parameter. I've grepped through the kernel and corrected all the users of this function.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#51: FILE: arch/ppc/4xx_io/serial_sicc.c:465:
+                handle_sysrq(ch, regs, NULL);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
