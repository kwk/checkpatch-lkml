CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#109: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2049:
+		sum_nr_running = avg_load = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
