WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#89: FILE: include/linux/netfilter/x_tables.h:24:
+ * to remove it -HW */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#91: FILE: include/linux/netfilter/x_tables.h:26:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
