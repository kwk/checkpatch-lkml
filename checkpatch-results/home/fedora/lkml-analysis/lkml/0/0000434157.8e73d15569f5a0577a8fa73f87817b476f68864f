Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
