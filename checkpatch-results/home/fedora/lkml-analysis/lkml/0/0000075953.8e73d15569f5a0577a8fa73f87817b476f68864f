WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#144: FILE: fs/nfs/direct.c:151:
+	int i;
+	for (i = 0; i < npages; i++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#257: FILE: fs/nfs/direct.c:382:
+	 * accounting is handled by nfs_direct_read_result() . */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#272: FILE: fs/nfs/direct.c:396:
+static ssize_t nfs_direct_read(struct kiocb *iocb, unsigned long user_addr, size_t count, loff_t pos)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
