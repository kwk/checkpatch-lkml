WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#56: FILE: drivers/base/firmware_class.c:35:
+ * guarding for corner cases a global lock should be OK */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*firmware)...) over kmalloc(sizeof (struct firmware)...)
#199: FILE: drivers/base/firmware_class.c:386:
+	*firmware_p = firmware = kmalloc(sizeof (struct firmware), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory
