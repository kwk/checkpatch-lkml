WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#108: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:551:
+		 * of unicode buffer. (13 * slots + nul) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <FillFailed>
#141: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:575:
+		goto FillFailed;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "name"
#200: FILE: fs/fat/dir.c:610:
+	if (name != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
