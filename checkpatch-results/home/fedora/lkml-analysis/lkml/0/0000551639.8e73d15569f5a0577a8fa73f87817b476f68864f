ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#86: FILE: mm/filemap.c:297:
+struct page * __find_page_simple(struct address_space *mapping, unsigned long index)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#206: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:418:
+#define MAX_LAUNDER 		(1 << page_cluster)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#426: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:720:
+				int maxcount = (page->buffers ? 2 : 1);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#433: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:727:
+					 * this happens too often ? */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
