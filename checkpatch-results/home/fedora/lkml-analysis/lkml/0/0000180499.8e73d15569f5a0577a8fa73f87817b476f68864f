CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/delay.h> instead of <asm/delay.h>
#66: FILE: arch/ppc/syslib/ppc83xx_setup.c:32:
+#include <asm/delay.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#74: FILE: arch/ppc/syslib/ppc83xx_setup.c:121:
+	volatile unsigned char __iomem *reg;
