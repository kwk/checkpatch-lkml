WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#27: 
(i.e. when calling uml_net) - reproduced the bug and verified this fixes it.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#60: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:46:
+	printk("helper_child - execve of '%s' failed - errno = %d\n", argv[0], errno);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'helper_child', this function's name, in a string
#60: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:46:
+	printk("helper_child - execve of '%s' failed - errno = %d\n", argv[0], errno);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#70: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:96:
+	 * the exec succeeded because the pipe fd was set as close-on-exec. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
