Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#84: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:935:
+			unsigned long reserve = memparse(from+11, &from);
+			reserve &= ~0x3fffff;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
