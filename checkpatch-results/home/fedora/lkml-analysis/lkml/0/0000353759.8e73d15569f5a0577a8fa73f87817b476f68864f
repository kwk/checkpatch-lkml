CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#40: FILE: asm/floppy.h:217:
+extern irqreturn_t floppy_hardint(int irq, void *unused, struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
