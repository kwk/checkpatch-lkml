#46: FILE: include/linux/hangcheck.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: include/linux/hangcheck.h:12:
+extern void touch_hangcheck_timer(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#59: FILE: include/linux/hangcheck.h:14:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
