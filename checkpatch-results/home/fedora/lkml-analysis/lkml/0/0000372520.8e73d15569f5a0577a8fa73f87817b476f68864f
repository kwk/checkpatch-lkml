ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0

+static volatile int leaving = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
