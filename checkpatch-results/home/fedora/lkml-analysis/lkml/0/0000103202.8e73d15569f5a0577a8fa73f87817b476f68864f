WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#37: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#42: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_av.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'adress' may be misspelled - perhaps 'address'?
#45: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_av.c:4:
+ *  adress vector functions
     ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated

+ *  $Id: ehca_av.c,v 1.28 2006/02/06 10:17:34 schickhj Exp $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#85: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_av.c:44:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#95: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_av.c:54:
+	extern int ehca_static_rate;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#115: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_av.c:74:
+	if (ehca_static_rate < 0) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
