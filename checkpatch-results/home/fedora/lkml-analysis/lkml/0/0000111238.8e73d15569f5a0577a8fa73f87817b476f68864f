CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "proto->memory_allocated"
#95: FILE: net/core/sock.c:1624:
+		   proto->memory_allocated != NULL ?

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#119: FILE: net/core/stream.c:201:
+		percpu_counter_mod_bh(sk->sk_prot->memory_allocated,
+				-(sk->sk_forward_alloc / SK_STREAM_MEM_QUANTUM));

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#185: FILE: net/decnet/af_decnet.c:2386:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
