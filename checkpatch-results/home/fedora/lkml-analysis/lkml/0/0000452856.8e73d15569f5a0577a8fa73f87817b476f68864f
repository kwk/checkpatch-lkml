 950     May 25 Andreas Mohr    (  80) SB16: 2.4.18 lockup on odd-numbered 16bit

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#91: FILE: drivers/sound/audio.c:288:
+		 * for 16bit output (which needs 2 bytes/sample)... */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
