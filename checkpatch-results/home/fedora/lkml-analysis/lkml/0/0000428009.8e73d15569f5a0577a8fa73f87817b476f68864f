ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#46: FILE: fs/Config.in:20:
CONFIG_HFS_FS $CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#51: FILE: fs/Config.in:22:
+source fs/befs/Config.in

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#60: FILE: fs/befs/Config.in:1:
+dep_tristate 'BeOS file systemv(BeFS) support (read only) (EXPERIMENTAL)' $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
