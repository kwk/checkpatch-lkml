CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <topCdromPtr>
#43: FILE: drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:2485:
+	return topCdromPtr ? topCdromPtr->dev : 0;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#55: FILE: init/main.c:314:
+static int rootcd_enable __initdata = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#63: FILE: init/main.c:322:
+__setup("rootcd=", rootcd_setup);

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#73: FILE: init/main.c:786:
+		extern kdev_t get_cdrom_dev(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
