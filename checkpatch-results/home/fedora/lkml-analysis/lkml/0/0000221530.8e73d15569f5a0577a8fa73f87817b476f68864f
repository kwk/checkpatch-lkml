CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!notification"
#81: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:167:
+	if (notification == NULL || (mode & BTE_NOTIFY_AND_GET_POINTER)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 17)

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:USE_NEGATIVE_ERRNO: return of an errno should typically be negative (ie: return -EINVAL)
#112: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:475:

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#123: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/bte.c:486:
+void sn_bte_bzero_init(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#134: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/setup.c:246:
+	extern void sn_bte_bzero_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
