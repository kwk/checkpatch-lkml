CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:268:
+extern int unuse_vma(struct vm_area_struct *vma, swp_entry_t entry, struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#64: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:481:
+int unuse_vma(struct vm_area_struct *vma,
 				swp_entry_t entry, struct page *page)
