Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#54: FILE: kernel/exit.c:74:
+	BUG_ON(!list_empty(&p->ptrace_list) || !list_empty(&p->ptrace_children));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#78: FILE: kernel/exit.c:453:
+	/* If we were tracing the thread, release it; otherwise preserve the
+	   ptrace links.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#81: FILE: kernel/exit.c:456:
+		task_t *trace_task = p->parent;
+		__ptrace_unlink(p);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#125: FILE: kernel/exit.c:734:
+				} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
