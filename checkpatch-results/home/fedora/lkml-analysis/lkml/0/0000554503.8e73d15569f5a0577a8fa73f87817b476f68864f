WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#96: 
#include <stdio.h>

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#172: FILE: kernel/sched.c:718:
+	for (i = 0; i < 0x10000; i++) {
+		do_one();
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#202: FILE: kernel/sched.c:748:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
