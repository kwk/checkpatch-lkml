ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#42: 
--- a/drivers/md/lvm.c	Thu Aug  9 18:17:52 2001

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#183: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1163:
+extern int fsync_dev_lockfs(kdev_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'kdev_t' should also have an identifier name
#183: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1163:
+extern int fsync_dev_lockfs(kdev_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
