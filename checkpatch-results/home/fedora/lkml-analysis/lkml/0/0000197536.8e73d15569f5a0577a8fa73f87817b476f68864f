ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#112: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:901:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#116: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:905:
+	BUG_ON (nr_copy_pages_check != nr_copy_pages);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#116: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:905:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
