----- START OF PATCH FOR fs/inode.c (kernel 2.4.20) --------------------------

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#164: FILE: inode.c:239:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#191: FILE: inode.c:1069:
+					    (I_DIRTY|I_LOCK))) {
 					            ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
