Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#63: FILE: fs/readdir.c:25:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#65: FILE: fs/readdir.c:27:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that close brace '}'
#68: FILE: fs/readdir.c:30:
+			}else   res = -ENOENT;

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#68: FILE: fs/readdir.c:30:
+			}else   res = -ENOENT;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
