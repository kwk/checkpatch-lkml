WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#115: FILE: include/linux/kevent.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_KEVENT_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#197: FILE: kernel/kevent.c:2:
+ * kernel/kevent.c - sysfs event delivery via netlink socket

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#198: FILE: kernel/kevent.c:3:
+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#220: FILE: kernel/kevent.c:25:
+static struct sock *kevent_sock = NULL;	/* kevent's global netlink socket */

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#267: FILE: kernel/kevent.c:72:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(send_kevent);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
