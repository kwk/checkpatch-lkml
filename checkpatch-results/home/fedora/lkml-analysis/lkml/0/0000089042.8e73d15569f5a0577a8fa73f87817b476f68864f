WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#109: FILE: fs/splice.c:51:
+		BUG_ON(!PageLRU(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <__ClearPageLRU>

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pipe_inode_info *' should also have an identifier name
#285: FILE: include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h:20:
+	int (*steal)(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct pipe_buffer *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
