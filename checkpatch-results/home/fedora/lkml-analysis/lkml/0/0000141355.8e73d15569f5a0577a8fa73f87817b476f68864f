#25: 
In this patch, a better but more intrusive solution is implemented, i.e. hold

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#48: FILE: arch/um/kernel/sigio_user.c:339:
+static struct pollfd* setup_initial_poll(int fd)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p"
#55: FILE: arch/um/kernel/sigio_user.c:344:
+	if (p == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

distractions when editing files.
