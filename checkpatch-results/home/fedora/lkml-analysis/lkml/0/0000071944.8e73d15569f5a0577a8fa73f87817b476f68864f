WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#93: FILE: arch/powerpc/mm/hugetlbpage.c:525:
+	 * so that further SLB misses do the right thing. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#96: FILE: arch/powerpc/mm/hugetlbpage.c:528:
+	if ((fi.newareas = loflush))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_HUGETLB_CLOSE_VMA' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#112: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/pgtable.h:158:
+#define ARCH_HAS_HUGETLB_CLOSE_VMA

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.
