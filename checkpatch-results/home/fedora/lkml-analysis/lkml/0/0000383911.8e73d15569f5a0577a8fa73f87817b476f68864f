#23: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-proc.c:2:
+ *  linux/drivers/ide/ide-proc.c	Version 1.05	Mar 05, 2003

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#42: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-proc.c:368:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
