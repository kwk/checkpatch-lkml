#40: 
the patch is against 2.5.62 and greatly improves stability on my SMP system.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#85: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:770:
+		 * 'cos it's faster than adding them in the middle */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
