ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#56: 
--- a/include/net/sock.h	Fri Feb 28 13:24:43 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "lock.owner"
#63: FILE: include/net/sock.h:359:
+	if ((__sk)->lock.owner != NULL || waitqueue_active(&((__sk)->lock.wq))) \

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:WAITQUEUE_ACTIVE: waitqueue_active without comment
