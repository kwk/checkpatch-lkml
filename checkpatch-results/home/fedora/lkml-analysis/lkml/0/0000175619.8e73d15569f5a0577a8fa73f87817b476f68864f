ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#63: FILE: mm/truncate.c:49:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#78: FILE: mm/truncate.c:63:
+		struct zone *zone = page_zone(page);
+		spin_lock_irqsave(&zone->lru_lock, flags);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
