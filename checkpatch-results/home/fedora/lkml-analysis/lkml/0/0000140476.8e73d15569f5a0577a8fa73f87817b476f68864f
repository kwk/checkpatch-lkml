#22: 
On an HP ze1115 notebook with a Mobile AMD K7, the CPU speed is measured twice, once when the CPU is initialized, and a second time when the powerrnow system is started. Sometimes the two readings agree; however, the second reading is usually higher, sometimes by very large factors. The dmesg excerpts below show one case where the difference is small.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#51: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/time.c:81:
+unsigned int cpu_khz=0; /* Detected as we calibrate the TSC */

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
