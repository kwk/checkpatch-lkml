CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/asm-sparc64/ptrace.h:102:
+extern unsigned long profile_pc(struct pt_regs *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#70: FILE: include/asm-sparc64/spinlock.h:54:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#119: FILE: include/asm-sparc64/spinlock.h:154:
+static void __inline__ __read_lock(rwlock_t *lock)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
