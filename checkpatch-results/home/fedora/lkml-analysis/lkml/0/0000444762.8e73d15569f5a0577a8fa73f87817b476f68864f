Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#50: 
--- a/scripts/Makefile	Wed Jul 24 22:52:07 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#484: FILE: scripts/docproc.c:315:
+		else {
+			defaultline(line);
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
