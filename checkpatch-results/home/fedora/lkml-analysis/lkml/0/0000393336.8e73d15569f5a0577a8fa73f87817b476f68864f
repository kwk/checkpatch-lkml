ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#31: 
--- a/include/linux/parport_pc.h	Fri Feb 14 09:50:44 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#38: FILE: include/linux/parport_pc.h:218:
+extern int parport_pc_inc_use_count(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#41: FILE: include/linux/parport_pc.h:220:
diff -Nru a/drivers/parport/parport_pc.c b/drivers/parport/parport_pc.c

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!base_res"
#84: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:2224:
+	if (base_res == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
