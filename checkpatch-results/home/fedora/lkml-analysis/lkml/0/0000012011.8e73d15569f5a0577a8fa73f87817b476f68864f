Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#120: FILE: fs/bio.c:47:
+#define BIOSLAB(x) { .nr_vecs = x, .name = "bio-"__stringify(x) }

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#130: FILE: fs/bio.c:56:
 };
+#undef BIOSLAB

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#242: FILE: fs/bio.c:161:
+			bvl = (void *) bio + sizeof(*bio);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:NEEDLESS_IF: mempool_destroy(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required
#295: FILE: fs/bio.c:1136:
+		if (bp)
+			mempool_destroy(bp);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#348: FILE: fs/bio.c:1172:
+		bs->slab = kmem_cache_create(bs->name, size, 0, SLAB_PANIC,
+						NULL, NULL);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#387: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:279:
+extern struct bio_set *bioset_create(int, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#387: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:279:
+extern struct bio_set *bioset_create(int, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name

+extern struct bio_set *bioset_create(int, int);
