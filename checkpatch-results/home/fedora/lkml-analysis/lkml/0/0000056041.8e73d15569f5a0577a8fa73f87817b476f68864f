Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#57: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:928:
+	int ok = spin_trylock(&dev->_xmit_lock);
+	if (likely(ok))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
