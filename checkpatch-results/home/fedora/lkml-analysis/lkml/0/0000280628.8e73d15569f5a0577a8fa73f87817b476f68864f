 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#105: FILE: drivers/block/io_context.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#106: FILE: drivers/block/io_context.c:2:
+ *  linux/drivers/block/io_context.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ioc"
#135: FILE: drivers/block/io_context.c:31:
+	if (ioc == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#138: FILE: drivers/block/io_context.c:34:
+	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&ioc->refcount) == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#155: FILE: drivers/block/io_context.c:51:
+	if (ioc) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#160: FILE: drivers/block/io_context.c:56:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ret"
#181: FILE: drivers/block/io_context.c:77:

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#214: FILE: drivers/block/io_context.c:110:
+	struct io_context *temp;
+	temp = *ioc1;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#458: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:28:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
