CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'files_stat.nr_files < files_stat.max_files'
#84: FILE: fs/file_table.c:60:
+	if ((files_stat.nr_files < files_stat.max_files) && (!current->euid ||
+	     NR_RESERVED_FILES - files_stat.nr_free_files <
+	     files_stat.max_files - files_stat.nr_files)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
