Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#71: FILE: process.c:104:
+ /*
+ * We use this to avoid nforce2 lockups

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#79: FILE: process.c:112:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#79: FILE: process.c:112:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#84: FILE: process.c:117:

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#89: FILE: process.c:122:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
