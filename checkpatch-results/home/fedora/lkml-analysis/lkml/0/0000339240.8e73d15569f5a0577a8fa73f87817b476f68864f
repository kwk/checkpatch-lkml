ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#42: FILE: drivers/acpi/pci_link.c:297:
+   $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#52: FILE: drivers/acpi/pci_link.c:321:
+	 * an extended one */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#53: FILE: drivers/acpi/pci_link.c:322:
+	if (irq <= 15) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#94: FILE: drivers/acpi/pci_link.c:361:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'resource_type == ACPI_RSTYPE_IRQ'
#96: FILE: drivers/acpi/pci_link.c:363:
+	if (ACPI_FAILURE(status) && (resource_type == ACPI_RSTYPE_IRQ)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
