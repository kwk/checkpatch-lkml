CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#139: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:22:
+extern const cpumask_t cpuset_task_cpus_allowed(const struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#147: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:42:
 }
+static inline cpumask_t cpuset_task_cpus_allowed(struct task_struct *p)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
