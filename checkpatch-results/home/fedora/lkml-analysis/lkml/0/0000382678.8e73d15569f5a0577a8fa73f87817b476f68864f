When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.

  char *linux_banner;

  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
