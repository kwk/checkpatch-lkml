In article <3F630C59.5090004@bigpond.com> (at Sat, 13 Sep 2003 22:23:53 +1000), James Harper <james.harper@bigpond.com> says:

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#70: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:290:
+int inline tcp6_only_sock(const struct sock *sk)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#131: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_minisocks.c:371:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
