Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#173: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:2533:
 	printk(KERN_INFO "Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ "
+		"%d ports, IRQ sharing %sabled\n", nr_uarts,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 118 exceeds 100 columns
#182: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:2594:
+MODULE_PARM_DESC(nr_uarts, "Maximum number of UARTs supported. (1-" __MODULE_STRING(CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS) ")");

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
