WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#57: FILE: include/asm-generic/pgtable.h:119:
+#define pte_clear_not_present_full(__mm, __address, __ptep, __full)	\
 do {									\
 	pte_clear((__mm), (__address), (__ptep));			\
 } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
