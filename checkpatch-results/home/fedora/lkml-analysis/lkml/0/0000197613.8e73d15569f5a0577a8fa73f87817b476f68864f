#57: FILE: drivers/connector/Kconfig:13:
+config CBUS
+	tristate "CBUS - ultra fast (for insert operations) message bus based on connector"
+	depends on CONNECTOR
+	---help---
+	  This message bus allows message passing between different agents
+	  using connector's infrastructure.
+	  It is extremly fast for insert operations so it can be used in performance
+	  critical pathes instead of direct connector's methods calls.
+
+	  CBUS uses per CPU variables and thus allows message reordering,
+	  caller must be prepared (and use CPU id in it's messages).
+	  
+	  CBUS support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
+	  will be called cbus.
