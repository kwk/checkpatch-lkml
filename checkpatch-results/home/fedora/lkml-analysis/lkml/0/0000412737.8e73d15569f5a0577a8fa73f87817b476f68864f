+	kaddr = p = (u32 *)kmap_atomic(*page, KM_USER0);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#107: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs2xdr.c:537:
+	strlen = (u32*)kmap_atomic(rcvbuf->pages[0], KM_USER0);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
