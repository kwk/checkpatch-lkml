WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const

+static struct file_operations ixj_fops =

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
