WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'mm' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#55: FILE: kernel/lockmeter.c:1517:
+	extern char __lock_text_start[], __lock_text_end[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#58: FILE: kernel/lockmeter.c:1520:

#88: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/spinlock.h:259:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
