WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#46: FILE: net/rose/af_rose.c:67:
+void rose_init_timers(struct sock *sk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#198: FILE: net/rose/rose_route.c:52:
+void rose_neigh_init_timers(struct rose_neigh *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct rose_neigh *' should also have an identifier name
#198: FILE: net/rose/rose_route.c:52:
+void rose_neigh_init_timers(struct rose_neigh *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
