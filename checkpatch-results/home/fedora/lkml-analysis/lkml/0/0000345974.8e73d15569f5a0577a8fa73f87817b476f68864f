ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#86: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/summit.c:97:
+static int __init build_detail_arrays(struct rio_table_hdr *rth,
 		struct scal_detail **sd, struct rio_detail **rd){

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#91: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/summit.c:102:
+^Iif ((rth->num_scal_dev > MAX_NUMNODES) || $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'rth->num_scal_dev > MAX_NUMNODES'
#91: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/summit.c:102:
+	if ((rth->num_scal_dev > MAX_NUMNODES) || 
+	    (rth->num_rio_dev > MAX_NUMNODES * 2)){

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open brace '{'
#92: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/summit.c:103:
+	    (rth->num_rio_dev > MAX_NUMNODES * 2)){

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 142 exceeds 100 columns
#93: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/summit.c:104:
+		printk("%s: MAX_NUMNODES too low!  Defined as %d, but system has %d nodes.\n", __FUNCTION__, MAX_NUMNODES, rth->num_scal_dev);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#93: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/summit.c:104:
+		printk("%s: MAX_NUMNODES too low!  Defined as %d, but system has %d nodes.\n", __FUNCTION__, MAX_NUMNODES, rth->num_scal_dev);

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#93: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/summit.c:104:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#137: FILE: include/asm-i386/mach-summit/mach_mpparse.h:9:
+extern void setup_summit(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
