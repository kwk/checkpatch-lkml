CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#119: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:260:
+	p = current->mm->arg_end = current->mm->arg_start;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
