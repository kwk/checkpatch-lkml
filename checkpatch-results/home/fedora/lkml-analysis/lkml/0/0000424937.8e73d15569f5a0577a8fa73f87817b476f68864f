ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#29: 
--- a/drivers/ide/ide-probe.c	Wed Oct  9 11:41:41 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#51: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1014:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#53: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1016:
+		ide_drive_t * drive = &hwif->drives[unit];

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
