WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#40: FILE: include/linux/kthread.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_KTHREAD_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct kthread *' should also have an identifier name
#52: FILE: include/linux/kthread.h:13:
+	int (*init)(struct kthread *, void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
