sometimes daemon dies silently, dont know why, dont know when, dont know where 

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#67: FILE: fs/exec.c:61:
+int log_sig_exit=0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
