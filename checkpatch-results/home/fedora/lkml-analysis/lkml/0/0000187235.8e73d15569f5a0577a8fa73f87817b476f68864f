ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#58: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c:59:
order

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#59: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c:60:
+			/* cast &mcelog.flags to (unsigned long *) in
+			   to prevent compiler warning. It is OK to cast

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#79: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c:139:
+fastcall void do_machine_check(struct pt_regs * regs, long error_code)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
