WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#79: FILE: fs/cachefiles/cf-daemon.c:623:
+	dirfd = simple_strtoul(args, &args, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
