CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*v9ses)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct v9fs_session_info)...)
#43: FILE: fs/9p/vfs_super.c:126:
+	v9ses = kzalloc(sizeof(struct v9fs_session_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
