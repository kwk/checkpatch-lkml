spaces are never used for indentation.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*server)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct nfs_server)...)
#294: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:245:
+	server = kzalloc(sizeof(struct nfs_server), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#300: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:251:
+	server->client = server->client_sys = server->client_acl = ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
