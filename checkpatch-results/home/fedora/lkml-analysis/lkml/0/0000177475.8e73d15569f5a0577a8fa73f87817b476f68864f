Ops, thanks. Latest one is appended again (also not wrapped this time) and..

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#69: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1082:
+static int find_idlest_cpu(struct sched_group *group, struct task_struct *p,
+			   int this_cpu)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
