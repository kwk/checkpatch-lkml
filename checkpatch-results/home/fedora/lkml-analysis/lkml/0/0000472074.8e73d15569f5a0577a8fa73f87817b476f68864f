The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#307: FILE: kernel/futex.c:70:
+			if (!recipient) recipient = this;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#307: FILE: kernel/futex.c:70:
+			if (!recipient) recipient = this;
[...]
+			else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
