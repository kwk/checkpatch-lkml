CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#141: FILE: include/linux/namespace.h:18:
+extern struct namespace *dup_namespace(struct task_struct *, struct fs_struct *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct task_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#141: FILE: include/linux/namespace.h:18:
+extern struct namespace *dup_namespace(struct task_struct *, struct fs_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct fs_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#141: FILE: include/linux/namespace.h:18:
+extern struct namespace *dup_namespace(struct task_struct *, struct fs_struct *);

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#157: FILE: kernel/fork.c:1393:
+static int unshare_namespace(unsigned long unshare_flags, struct namespace **new_nsp, struct fs_struct *new_fs)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#180: FILE: kernel/fork.c:1490:
+	if ((err = unshare_namespace(unshare_flags, &new_ns, new_fs)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
