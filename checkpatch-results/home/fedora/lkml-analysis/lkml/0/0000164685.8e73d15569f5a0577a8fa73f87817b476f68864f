CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'count > PAGE_SIZE'
#65: FILE: drivers/video/fbsysfs.c:255:
+	if ((count > PAGE_SIZE) || ((count % 16) != 0))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
