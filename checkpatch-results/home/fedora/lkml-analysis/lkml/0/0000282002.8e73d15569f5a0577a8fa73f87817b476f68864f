ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#82: 
--- a/drivers/input/serio/i8042.c	Tue May 11 00:58:28 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

+^I      ^I      ((str & I8042_STR_TIMEOUT) ? SERIO_TIMEOUT : 0);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

+		if (i8042_mux_values[0].exists && (str & I8042_STR_AUXDATA)) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent

+				switch (data) {
+					case 0xfd:
+					case 0xfe: dfl = SERIO_TIMEOUT; break;
+					case 0xff: dfl = SERIO_PARITY; break;

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;

  default:

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#167: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:417:
+					case 0xfe: dfl = SERIO_TIMEOUT; break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#270: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:488:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
