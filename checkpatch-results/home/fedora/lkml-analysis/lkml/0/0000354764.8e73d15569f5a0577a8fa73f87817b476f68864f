#29: 
I've modified Mike Galbraith's nanosleep work for greater resolution to help 

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#71: FILE: kernel/sched.c:87:
+extern unsigned long long monotonic_clock(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#95: FILE: kernel/sched.c:410:
+	} else p->sleep_nsecs += sleep;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
