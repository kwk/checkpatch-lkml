Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'create_pbe_list', this function's name, in a string
#372: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:647:
+	pr_debug("create_pbe_list(): initialized %d PBEs\n", num);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#440: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:968:
+static void **eaten_memory = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#442: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:970:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
