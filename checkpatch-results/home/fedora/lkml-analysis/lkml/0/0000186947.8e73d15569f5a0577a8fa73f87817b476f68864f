#49: 
function called in the trap handler context and passed the full trap details.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#171: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:395:
+		extern void iret_exc(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#179: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:403:
+		regs->eip = (unsigned long) &iret_exc;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+			return (*hook) (regs, trapnr, signr, error_code, info);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
