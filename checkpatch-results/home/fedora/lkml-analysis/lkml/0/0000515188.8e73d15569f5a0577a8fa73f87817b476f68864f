ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#188: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:400:
+		struct dentry * dentry = filp->f_dentry;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#190: FILE: fs/proc/generic.c:402:
+		struct file_operations *fops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
