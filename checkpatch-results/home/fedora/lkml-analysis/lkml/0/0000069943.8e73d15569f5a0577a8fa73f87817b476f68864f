#37: 
- hpt370_lostirq_timeout() cleared the DMA status which made __ide_dma_end()

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#65: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c		Version 0.52	Jun 07, 2006

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#97: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:696:
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: %d bytes in FIFO\n", drive->name, bfifo & 0x1ff);

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#125: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:723:
+			/* fallthrough */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.
