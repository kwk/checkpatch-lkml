#36: 
- reclaim for weaker watermark by calling watermark_ok() with classzone_idx=0

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'garuantees' may be misspelled - perhaps 'guarantees'?
#38: 
That garuantees reclaims-for-aging to be more than reclaims-for-watermark if
     ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#67: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1381:
+			youngest_zone = oldest_zone = zone;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#104: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1417:
+				if (!zone_watermark_ok(zone, order,
[...]
+				} else if (zone == youngest_zone &&
[...]
+				} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#105: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1418:

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#111: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1424:
