+	---help---
+	  Say Y here if you want to use an Apple USB Touchpad.
+
+	  These are the touchpads that can be found on post-February 2005
+	  Apple Powerbooks (prior models have a Synaptics touchpad connected
+	  to the ADB bus).
+
+	  This driver provides a basic mouse driver but can be interfaced
+	  with the synaptics X11 driver to provide acceleration and
+	  scrolling in X11.
+
+	  For further information, see
+	  <file:Documentation/input/appletouch.txt>.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called appletouch.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#594: FILE: drivers/usb/input/appletouch.c:310:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
