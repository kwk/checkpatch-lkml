to fail on all Coppermines. A fix for this had been sent to Linus already;
               ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 150 exceeds 100 columns

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
