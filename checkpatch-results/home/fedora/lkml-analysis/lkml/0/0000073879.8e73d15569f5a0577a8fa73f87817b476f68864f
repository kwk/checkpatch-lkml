For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
