WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#26: 
Adds the basic functions and registering the CPU controller to resource group.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#44: FILE: init/Kconfig:188:
+config RES_GROUPS_CPU
+	bool "CPU Resource Controller"
+	select CPU_RC
+	depends on RES_GROUPS
+	default y
+	help
+	  Provides a CPU Resource Controller for Resource Groups.
+
+	  Say N if unsure, Y to use the feature.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#71: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#72: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:2:
+ *  kernel/res_group/cpu.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'resouce' may be misspelled - perhaps 'resource'?
#93: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:23:
+	struct resource_group *rgroup;	/* resouce group I belong to */
 	                              	   ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#96: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:26:
+^Iint ^Icnt_total_min_shares;/* total min_shares behind the res_group */$

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cpu_ctlr.ctlr_id == NO_RES_ID'
#120: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:50:
+	if ((cpu_ctlr.ctlr_id == NO_RES_ID) || (rgroup == NULL))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'rgroup == NULL'
#120: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:50:
+	if ((cpu_ctlr.ctlr_id == NO_RES_ID) || (rgroup == NULL))

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rgroup"
#120: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:50:
+	if ((cpu_ctlr.ctlr_id == NO_RES_ID) || (rgroup == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('
#143: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:73:
+static struct res_shares *cpu_alloc_shares_struct(

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*res)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct cpu)...)
#148: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:78:
+	res = kzalloc(sizeof(struct cpu), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#175: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:105:
+		temp = (u64) parres->shares.unused_min_shares

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#205: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:135:
+	int rc;
+	do {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#208: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:138:
+	BUG_ON(rc != 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
