#29: 
we can wait to hold it. Also take task_lock and try to improve the docs a bit.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#39: FILE: drivers/oprofile/buffer_sync.c:340:
+static struct mm_struct * take_tasks_mm(struct task_struct * task)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
