Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#102: FILE: drivers/net/tulip/tulip.h:47:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#102: FILE: drivers/net/tulip/tulip.h:47:
+	void (*media_timer) (unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
