# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#159: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:124:
+int block_dump = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 156 exceeds 100 columns

+		printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: %s block %lu/%u on %s\n", current->comm, rw == WRITE ? "WRITE" : "READ", bh->b_rsector, count, kdevname(bh->b_rdev));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
