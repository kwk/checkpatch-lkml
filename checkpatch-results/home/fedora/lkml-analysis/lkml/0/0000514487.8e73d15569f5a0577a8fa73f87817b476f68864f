Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'reset_hc', this function's name, in a string
#149: FILE: uhci.c:2090:
+       info("reset_hc called");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#158: FILE: uhci.c:2427:
+               suspend_hc(uhci);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
