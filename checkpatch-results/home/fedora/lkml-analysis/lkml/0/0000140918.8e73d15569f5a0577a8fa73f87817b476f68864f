Have just taken a wander through the TPM driver.  I couldn't help myself - are

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devexit is unnecessary
#121: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_atmel.c:164:
 static void __devexit tpm_atml_remove(struct device *dev)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pdev)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct platform_device)...)
#134: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_atmel.c:204:
+	pdev = kzalloc(sizeof(struct platform_device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#147: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_atmel.c:214:
+	if ((rc = platform_device_register(pdev)) < 0) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#230: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:381:
+ssize_t tpm_write(struct file * file, const char __user *buf,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
