WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config CC_STACKPROTECTOR_ALL

+	depends on CC_STACKPROTECTOR
+	help
+	  Normally, GCC only inserts the canary value protection for
+	  functions that use large-ish on-stack buffers. By enabling
+	  this option, GCC will be asked to do this for ALL functions.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
