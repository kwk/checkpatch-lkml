distribution. The patch currently resides in the -mm kernels. It is being used

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#37: 
Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#68: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:180:
+	 * writable, if an error is returned it will cause a SIGBUS */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#93: FILE: mm/filemap.c:1461:
+struct vm_operations_struct generic_file_vm_mkwr_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
