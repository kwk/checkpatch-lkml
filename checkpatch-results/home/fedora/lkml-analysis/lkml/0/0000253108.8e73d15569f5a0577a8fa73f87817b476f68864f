ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#60: FILE: fs/read_write.c:567:
+	struct inode * in_inode, * out_inode;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#192: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1021:
+ssize_t vfs_sendfile(struct file *, struct file *, loff_t *, size_t, loff_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
