WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#50: FILE: drivers/media/video/cx88/cx88-cards.c:1490:
+			static const u8 buffer [] = { 0x10,0x12,0x13,0x04,0x16,0x00,0x14,0x04,0x017,0x00 };

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }
