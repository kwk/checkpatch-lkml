### Comments for Changeset

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix '.' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#75: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c:253:
+		 * operation */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
