+config BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD
+	bool "Boot off-board chipsets first support"

+	---help---
+	  Normally, IDE controllers built into the motherboard (on-board
+	  controllers) are assigned to ide0 and ide1 while those on add-in PCI
+	  cards (off-board controllers) are relegated to ide2 and ide3.
+	  Answering Y here will allow you to reverse the situation, with
+	  off-board controllers on ide0/1 and on-board controllers on ide2/3.
+	  This can improve the usability of some boot managers such as lilo
+	  when booting from a drive on an off-board controller.
+
+	  If you say Y here, and you actually want to reverse the device scan
+	  order as explained above, you also need to issue the kernel command
+	  line option "ide=reverse". (Try "man bootparam" or see the
+	  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
+	  pass options to the kernel at boot time.)
+
+	  Note that, if you do this, the order of the hd* devices will be
+	  rearranged which may require modification of fstab and other files.
+
+	  If in doubt, say N.

+	---help---
+	  There are unclear terms in ATA-4 and ATA-5 standards how certain
+	  hardware (an 80c ribbon) should be detected. Different interpretations
+	  of the standards have been released in hardware. This causes problems:
+	  for example, a host with Ultra Mode 4 (or higher) will not run
+	  in that mode with an 80c ribbon.
+
+	  If you are experiencing compatibility or performance problems, you
+	  MAY try to answering Y here. However, it does not necessarily solve
+	  any of your problems, it could even cause more of them.
+
+	  It is normally safe to answer Y; however, the default is N.
