WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#27: 
#include'ing C files.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#59: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/hostap/Makefile:2:
+            hostap_ioctl.o hostap_main.o hostap_proc.o $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:ARRAY_SIZE: Prefer ARRAY_SIZE(freq_list)
#76: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/hostap/hostap.h:11:
+#define FREQ_COUNT (sizeof(freq_list) / sizeof(freq_list[0]))

The ARRAY_SIZE(foo) macro should be preferred over
sizeof(foo)/sizeof(foo[0]) for finding number of elements in an
array.

The macro is defined in include/linux/kernel.h::

  #define ARRAY_SIZE(x) (sizeof(x) / sizeof((x)[0]))

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#98: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/hostap/hostap.h:65:
+void * ap_crypt_get_ptrs(struct ap_data *ap, u8 *addr, int permanent,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct ethtool_ops should normally be const
#115: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/hostap/hostap.h:89:
+extern struct ethtool_ops prism2_ethtool_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
