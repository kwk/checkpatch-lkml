Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#104: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:908:
+extern int __init serial8250_console_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#138: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1988:
+	static int initialized = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#139: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:1989:
+	static int initialized = 0;
+	if (initialized)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
