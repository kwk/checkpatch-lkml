CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:288:
+extern void init_disk(struct gendisk *disk, int minors,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#101: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:384:
+/* init_disk assumes disk should is initialized to all zeroes,
+   except for disk->part, which points to the partitions structures,

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#102: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:385:
+   which are also assumed to be initialized to all zeroes. */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#105: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:388:
+	BUG_ON(minors > 1 && parts == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!parts"
#105: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:388:
+	BUG_ON(minors > 1 && parts == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#141: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:407:
+		init_disk(disk, minors, (struct hd_struct*) &disk[1]);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#141: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:407:
+		init_disk(disk, minors, (struct hd_struct*) &disk[1]);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#152: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:430:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(init_disk);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
