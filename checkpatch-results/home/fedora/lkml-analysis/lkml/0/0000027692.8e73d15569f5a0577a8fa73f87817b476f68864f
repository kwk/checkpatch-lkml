WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#57: FILE: drivers/atm/iphase.c:1424:
+	iadev->rx_dle_q.end = (struct dle*)((unsigned long)dle_addr+sizeof(struct dle)*DLE_ENTRIES);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#74: FILE: drivers/atm/iphase.c:1583:
+        $

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

#88: FILE: drivers/atm/iphase.c:1911:
+	iadev->tx_dle_q.end = (struct dle*)((unsigned long)dle_addr+sizeof(struct dle)*DLE_ENTRIES);  

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
