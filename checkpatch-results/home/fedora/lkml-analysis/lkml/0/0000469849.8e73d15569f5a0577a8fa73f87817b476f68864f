> What I was proposing was a relative wall clock time, vs application virtual 

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#65: FILE: kernel/futex.c:159:
+		struct timespec t;
+		if (copy_from_user(&t, utime, sizeof(t)) != 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#89: FILE: kernel/futex.c:182:
+	/* If we were signalled, or timed out, we might have just been woken:
+	   we must wake another one.  Otherwise we need to wake someone

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
