WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#45: 
#linuxfs on irc.oftc.net.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#126: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:122:
+#define MS_LAZYATIME	(1<<21)	/* Lazily update on-disk access times. */
                     	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#126: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:122:
+#define MS_LAZYATIME	(1<<21)	/* Lazily update on-disk access times. */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
