ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#53: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:430:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#54: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:431:
+	if (bad_ppro && page_kills_ppro(pfn))
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#82: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:459:
+	for (tmp = highstart_pfn; tmp < highend_pfn; tmp++) {
+		init_one_highpage((struct page *) (mem_map + tmp), tmp, bad_ppro);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
