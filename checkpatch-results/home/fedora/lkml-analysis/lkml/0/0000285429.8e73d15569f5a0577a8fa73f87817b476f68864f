#26: 
This patch fixes the linux/include/cciss_ioctl.h file. When support for the cciss big ioctl was added the stucture in the header was put in the wrong place. If an application includes the file it will fail to compile.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'stucture' may be misspelled - perhaps 'structure'?
