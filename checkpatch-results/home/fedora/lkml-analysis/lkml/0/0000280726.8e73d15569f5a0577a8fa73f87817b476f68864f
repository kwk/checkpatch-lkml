# This is a BitKeeper generated diff -Nru style patch.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#56: 
--- a/drivers/video/console/fbcon.c	Sat May 15 22:54:19 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#175: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.h:41:
+extern int set_con2fb_map(int start, int end, int newidx);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
