WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#141: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse.h:1:
+#ifndef _PSMOUSE_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#148: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse.h:8:
+#define PSMOUSE_CMD_POLL^I0x03eb^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

#253: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.h:14:
+extern void synaptics_process_byte(struct psmouse *psmouse, struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
