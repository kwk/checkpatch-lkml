CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/bug.h> instead of <asm/bug.h>
#62: FILE: arch/ppc64/xmon/xmon.c:34:
+#include <asm/bug.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bug"
#81: FILE: arch/ppc64/xmon/xmon.c:1334:
+	if (bug == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
