Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#132: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:58:
+extern int i2c_transfer(struct i2c_adapter *adap, struct i2c_msg *msg,int num);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#141: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:197:
+^Iint (*master_xfer)(struct i2c_adapter *adap,struct i2c_msg *msgs, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#152: FILE: drivers/i2c/i2c-core.c:586:
+int i2c_transfer(struct i2c_adapter * adap, struct i2c_msg *msgs,int num)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
