WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 122 exceeds 100 columns
#141: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c:22:
+static u8 OSC_UUID[16] = {0x5B, 0x4D, 0xDB, 0x33, 0xF7, 0x1F, 0x1C, 0x40, 0x96, 0x57, 0x74, 0x41, 0xC0, 0x3D, 0xD7, 0x66};

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
