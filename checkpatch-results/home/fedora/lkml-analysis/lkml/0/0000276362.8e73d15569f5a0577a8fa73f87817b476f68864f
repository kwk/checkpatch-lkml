The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#219: FILE: fs/ntfs/mft.c:476:
+	BUG_ON(!page);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <NInoAttr>
#220: FILE: fs/ntfs/mft.c:477:

grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#273: FILE: fs/ntfs/mft.h:60:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
