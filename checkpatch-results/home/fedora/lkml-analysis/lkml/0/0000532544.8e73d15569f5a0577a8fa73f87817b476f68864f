#19: 
fixed patch poster earlier.  PINE's default editor munged it up.  Also changed

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'drivers' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hpnt->hostt->proc_info"
#37: FILE: scsi/scsi_proc.c:102:
+	if (hpnt->hostt->proc_info == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#38: FILE: scsi/scsi_proc.c:103:
+		ret = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
