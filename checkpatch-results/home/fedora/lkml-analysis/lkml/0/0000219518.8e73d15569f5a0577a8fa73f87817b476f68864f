ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#59: FILE: include/asm-sparc64/page.h:19:
+static void inline clear_page(void *page, int order)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
