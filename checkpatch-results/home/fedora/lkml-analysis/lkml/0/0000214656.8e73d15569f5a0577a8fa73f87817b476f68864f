WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#111: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:130:
+static struct dentry_operations vfat_dentry_ops[4] = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#285: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:546:
+					if ((charlen = nls->char2uni(ip, len - i, (wchar_t *)op)) < 0)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#285: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:546:
+					if ((charlen = nls->char2uni(ip, len - i, (wchar_t *)op)) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#390: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:758:
+				  struct nameidata *nd)
 				                    ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#415: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:786:
+		if (d_invalidate(alias) == 0)
[...]
 		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#434: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:808:
+		       struct nameidata *nd)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#498: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:882:
+	inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = CURRENT_TIME_SEC;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

#528: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:906:
+	inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = CURRENT_TIME_SEC;

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
