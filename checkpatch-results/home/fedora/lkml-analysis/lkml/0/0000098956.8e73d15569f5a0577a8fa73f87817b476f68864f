Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#122: FILE: fs/buffer.c:864:
+		unsigned long	flags;
+		write_lock_irqsave(&mapping->tree_lock, flags);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#143: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:715:
+		if (TestClearPageDirty(page) && (page_mapping(page) == mapping)) { /* Race with truncate? */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#166: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:796:
+		if (!PageDirty(page) && (page_mapping(page) == mapping))	/* Race with truncate? */

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'page->mapping != mapping'
#178: FILE: mm/truncate.c:71:
+	if (PageDirty(page) || (page->mapping != mapping)) { /* Race with truncate? */

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
