CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/audit.h:242:
+extern int audit_avc_path(struct dentry *dentry, struct vfsmount *mnt);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#111: FILE: kernel/auditsc.c:564:
+			struct audit_aux_data_path *axi = (void *)aux;
+			dput(axi->dentry);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
