Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#78: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpuid.c:175:
+	if (IS_ERR(class_err)) {
+		err = PTR_ERR(class_err);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#83: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpuid.c:180:
+static int __devinit cpuid_class_cpu_callback(struct notifier_block *nfb, unsigned long action, void *hcpu)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
