Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#90: FILE: include/asm-ppc/tlb.h:2:
+ * include/asm-ppc/tlb.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:NEW_TYPEDEFS: do not add new typedefs

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *		bar" should be "foo *bar"
#129: FILE: include/asm-ppc/tlb.h:40:
+	struct page *		pages[FREE_PTE_NR];

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#146: FILE: include/asm-ppc/tlb.h:57:
+		unsigned long i;
+		flush_tlb_mm_range(tlb->mm, tlb->start, tlb->end + PAGE_SIZE);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#204: FILE: include/asm-ppc/tlb.h:115:
+	BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#218: FILE: include/asm-ppc/tlb.h:129:
+	if (tlb->nr == 0)
[...]
+	else if (address - tlb->end > 32 * PAGE_SIZE) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#239: FILE: include/asm-ppc/tlbflush.h:31:

+static inline void flush_tlb_mm_range(struct mm_struct *mm,
+				unsigned long start, unsigned long end)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#258: FILE: include/asm-ppc/tlbflush.h:70:
+extern void flush_tlb_mm_range(struct mm_struct *mm,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "mp"
#331: FILE: arch/ppc/mm/tlb.c:140:
+	for (mp = mm->mmap; mp != NULL; mp = mp->vm_next)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
