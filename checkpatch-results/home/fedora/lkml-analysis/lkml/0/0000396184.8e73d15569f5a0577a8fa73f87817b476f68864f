CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#48: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:168:
+extern void set_cpus_allowed(struct task_struct *p, unsigned long new_mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#88: FILE: kernel/sched.c:866:
+	BUG_ON(!new_mask);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
