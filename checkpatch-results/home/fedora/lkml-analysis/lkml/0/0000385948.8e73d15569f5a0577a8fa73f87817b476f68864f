ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

<scott.bailey@eds.com>

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'conf->mirrors[disk].operational'
#85: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:498:
+			if ((conf->mirrors[disk].operational) &&
+				(!conf->mirrors[disk].write_only)) break;

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around '!conf->mirrors[disk].write_only'
#85: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:498:
+			if ((conf->mirrors[disk].operational) &&
+				(!conf->mirrors[disk].write_only)) break;

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#85: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:498:
+			if ((conf->mirrors[disk].operational) &&
+				(!conf->mirrors[disk].write_only)) break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#86: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:499:
+			if ((conf->mirrors[disk].operational) &&
+				(!conf->mirrors[disk].write_only)) break;

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#135: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:536:
+	/* current_distance is initialized to guaranteed worse-than-worst
+	   so that we can simplify loop logic */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
