Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#109: FILE: mm/readahead.c:109:
+extern struct file_operations ra_debug_fops;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#109: FILE: mm/readahead.c:109:
+extern struct file_operations ra_debug_fops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
