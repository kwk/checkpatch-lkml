Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#65: FILE: i386/kernel/irq.c:587:
+		int i; 
+		for (i=0; i<NR_IRQS; i++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
