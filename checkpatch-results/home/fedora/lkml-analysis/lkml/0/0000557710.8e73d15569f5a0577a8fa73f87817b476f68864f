# CONFIG_NETFILTER is not set

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#141: FILE: read_write.c:149:
+extern struct file_operations socket_file_ops;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#141: FILE: read_write.c:149:
+extern struct file_operations socket_file_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
