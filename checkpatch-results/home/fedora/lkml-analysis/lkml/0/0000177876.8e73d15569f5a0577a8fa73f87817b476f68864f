WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 157 exceeds 100 columns
#92: FILE: drivers/rapidio/rio-scan.c:193:
+	u32 mask = RIO_OPS_READ | RIO_OPS_WRITE | RIO_OPS_ATOMIC_TST_SWP | RIO_OPS_ATOMIC_INC | RIO_OPS_ATOMIC_DEC | RIO_OPS_ATOMIC_SET | RIO_OPS_ATOMIC_CLR;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
