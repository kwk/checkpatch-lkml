Subject: [PATCH -mm 5/8] user ns: prepare copy_tree, copy_mnt, and their callers to handle errs

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#52: FILE: fs/namespace.c:711:
+	if (!q || IS_ERR(q)) {
+		return q;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
