Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#61: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:55:
+int sysctl_node_swap = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#134: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1171:
+	extern int sysctl_node_swap;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#139: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1175:
+	if (zone->free_pages > (zone->present_pages * sysctl_node_swap) << 10 && zone->free_pages > zone->pages_low)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
