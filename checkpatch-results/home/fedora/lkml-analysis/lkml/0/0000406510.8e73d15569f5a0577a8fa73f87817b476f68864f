WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#61: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#62: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c:2:
+ * linux/arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/cpufeature.h> instead of <asm/cpufeature.h>
#74: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c:14:
+#include <asm/cpufeature.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#86: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c:26:
+	rel32 = (unsigned long) sysenter_entry - (page+11);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#88: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c:28:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#88: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/sysenter.c:28:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
