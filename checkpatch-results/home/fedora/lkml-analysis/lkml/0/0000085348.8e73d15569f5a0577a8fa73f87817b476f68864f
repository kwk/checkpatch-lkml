WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#39: FILE: init/main.c:329:
+extern unsigned long *__per_cpu_offset_start,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#58: FILE: init/main.c:345:
+		unsigned long **offsets = &__per_cpu_offset_start;
+		printk("setting up percpu from %p to %p with %p\n",

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
