CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#57: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/numaq.c:34:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#68: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/numaq.c:84:
