Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#116: FILE: arch/um/drivers/mconsole_kern.c:84:
+	if(!list_empty(&mc_requests)) schedule_work(&mconsole_work);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: arch/um/include/chan_kern.h:25:
+extern void chan_interrupt(struct list_head *chans, struct work_struct *task,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
