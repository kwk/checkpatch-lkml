CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:104:
+extern void hrtimer_init(struct hrtimer *timer, clockid_t which_clock,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#149: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:658:
+	hrtimer_init(&timer, (clockid_t) restart->arg3, HRTIMER_ABS);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
