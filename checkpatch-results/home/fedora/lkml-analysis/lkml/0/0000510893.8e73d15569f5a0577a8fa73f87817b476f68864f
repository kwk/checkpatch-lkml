CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#68: FILE: include/linux/list.h:95:
+       entry->next = entry->prev = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
