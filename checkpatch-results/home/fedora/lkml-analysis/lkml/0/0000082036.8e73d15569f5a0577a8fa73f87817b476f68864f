WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#40: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/hcp_phyp.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#88: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/hcp_phyp.h:49:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#90: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/hcp_phyp.h:51:
+/* eHCA page (mapped into memory)
+    resource to access eHCA register pages in CPU address space

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#109: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/hcp_phyp.h:70:
+inline static u64 hipz_galpa_load(struct h_galpa galpa, u32 offset)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#220: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/hcp_phyp.c:81:

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

#233: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/hcp_phyp.c:94:
+	galpas->user.fw_handle = galpas->kernel.fw_handle = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
