ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#69: 
--- a/drivers/scsi/scsi.c	Fri Oct  4 08:37:58 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SCpnt>
#86: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi.c:1351:
+	scsi_setup_cmd_retry(SCpnt);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Cmnd>
#97: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi.h:470:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#97: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi.h:470:
+extern void scsi_setup_cmd_retry(Scsi_Cmnd *SCpnt);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
