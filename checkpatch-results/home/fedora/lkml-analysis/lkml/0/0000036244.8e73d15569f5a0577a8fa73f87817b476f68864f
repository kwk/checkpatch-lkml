WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#275: FILE: drivers/usb/input/xpad.c:75:
+/* xbox d-pads should map to buttons, as is required for DDR pads

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#280: FILE: drivers/usb/input/xpad.c:80:
+static int dpad_to_buttons = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#281: FILE: drivers/usb/input/xpad.c:81:
+module_param(dpad_to_buttons, bool, S_IRUGO);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
