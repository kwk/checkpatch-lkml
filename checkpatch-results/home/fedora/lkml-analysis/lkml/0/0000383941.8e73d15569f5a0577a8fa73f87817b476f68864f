1) sd.c -  sd_index_bits[] arrys became big - need to be fixed.
                           ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#104: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:60:
+#define SD_DISKS_PER_MAJOR	(1 << SD_DISKS_PER_MAJOR_SHIFT)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#132: FILE: drivers/scsi/sd.c:1347:
+		const unsigned int m3 = index % 26;
+		sprintf(gd->disk_name, "sd%c%c%c", 

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
