WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#72: 
Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#91: FILE: fs/nfs/callback.c:40:
+static const int nfs_set_port_min = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#97: FILE: fs/nfs/callback.c:46:
+	int num = simple_strtol(val, &endp, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#98: FILE: fs/nfs/callback.c:47:
+	int num = simple_strtol(val, &endp, 0);
+	if (endp == val || *endp || num < nfs_set_port_min || num > nfs_set_port_max)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#167: FILE: fs/nfs/internal.h:49:
+extern int nfs_stat_to_errno(int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
