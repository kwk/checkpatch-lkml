WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#85: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pcf8583.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#86: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pcf8583.c:2:
+ *  drivers/rtc/rtc-pcf8583.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'susbsystem' may be misspelled - perhaps 'subsystem'?
#96: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pcf8583.c:12:
+ *  Converted to the generic RTC susbsystem by G. Liakhovetski (2006)

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#290: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pcf8583.c:206:
+		if ((err = pcf8583_set_ctrl(client, &new_ctrl)) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct rtc_class_ops should normally be const
#360: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-pcf8583.c:276:
+static struct rtc_class_ops pcf8583_rtc_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
