ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#90: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:285:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#154: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:421:
+static void __split_bio(struct mapped_device *md, struct bio *bio,
+						struct bio_list *bl)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#195: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:473:
+	list.head = list.tail = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
