Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#235: FILE: drivers/ide/qd65xx.c:179:
+	if (qd_timing_ok(ch->drives)) {
[...]
+		ch->selectproc = NULL;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 147 exceeds 100 columns
#254: FILE: drivers/ide/qd65xx.c:285:
+static void __init qd_setup(int unit, int base, int config, unsigned int data0, unsigned int data1, void (*tuneproc) (struct ata_device *, u8 pio))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#287: FILE: drivers/ide/qd65xx.c:303:
+static void __init qd_unsetup(int unit) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
