create a seperate notify list for nmi events?
         ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/kdebug.h> instead of <asm/kdebug.h>
#87: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:35:
+#include <asm/kdebug.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
