Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }
