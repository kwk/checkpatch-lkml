WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#69: FILE: arch/i386/boot/compressed/relocs.c:73:
+	if (type < ARRAY_SIZE(type_name)) {
 		name = type_name[type];
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
