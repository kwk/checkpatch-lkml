WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#102: FILE: kernel/lockmeter.c:1505:
+	extern char __lock_text_start[], __lock_text_end[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#105: FILE: kernel/lockmeter.c:1508:
+	return addr >= (unsigned long)__lock_text_start
+	&& addr < (unsigned long)__lock_text_end;
