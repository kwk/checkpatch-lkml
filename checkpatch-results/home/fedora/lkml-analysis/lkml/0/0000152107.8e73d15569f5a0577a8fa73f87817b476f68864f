Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a

However this is not always the case (See signal.h).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.

error condition as gracefully as possible.
