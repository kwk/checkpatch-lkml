ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#66: 
--- a/drivers/ide/ide.c	Sun Jun 23 17:08:19 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#78: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:559:
+void ide_set_handler(struct ata_device *drive, ata_handler_t handler,
+		      unsigned long timeout, ata_expiry_t expiry)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ch->handler"
#85: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:566:
+	if (ch->handler != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#86: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:567:
+		printk("%s: ide_set_handler: handler not null; old=%p, new=%p, from %p\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ide_set_handler', this function's name, in a string
#86: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:567:
+		printk("%s: ide_set_handler: handler not null; old=%p, new=%p, from %p\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#87: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:568:

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 122 exceeds 100 columns

+		if ((drive->id->command_set_2 & 0x0400) && (drive->id->cfs_enable_2 & 0x0400) && (drive->addressing == 1))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'drive->addressing == 1'

+		if ((drive->id->command_set_2 & 0x0400) && (drive->id->cfs_enable_2 & 0x0400) && (drive->addressing == 1))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns

+			u8 HIHI = (drive->addressing) ? 0xE0 : 0xEF;
+			OUT_BYTE((args.taskfile.device_head & HIHI) | drive->select.all, IDE_SELECT_REG);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
