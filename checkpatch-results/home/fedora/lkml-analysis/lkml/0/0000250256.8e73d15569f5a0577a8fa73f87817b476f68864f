CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/asm-i386/mpspec.h:36:
+extern int mp_register_gsi (u32 gsi, int edge_level, int active_high_low);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
