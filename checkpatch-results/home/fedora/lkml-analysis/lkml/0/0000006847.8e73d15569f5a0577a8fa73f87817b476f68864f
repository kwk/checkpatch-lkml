The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#269: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/bcm43xx/bcm43xx.h:356:
+#define BCM43xx_MMIO_RADIO_HWENABLED_HI_MASK (1 << 16)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#270: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/bcm43xx/bcm43xx.h:357:
