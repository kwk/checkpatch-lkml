+static snd_gf1_mem_block_t *snd_gf1_mem_xalloc(snd_gf1_mem_t * alloc,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
