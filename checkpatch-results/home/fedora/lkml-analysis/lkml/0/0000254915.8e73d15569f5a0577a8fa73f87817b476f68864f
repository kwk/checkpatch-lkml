WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#31: 
>  ( If I didn't mention this before, pressing '/' invokes the search window )

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#47: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:31:
 	"Pressing <Y> includes, <N> excludes, <M> modularizes features.  "
+	"Press <Esc><Esc> to exit, <?> for Help, </> for Search.  "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#67: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:282:
+	/* Ignore invisible menus ?
+	if (!menu_is_visible(menu))

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!fp"
#92: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:307:
+	if (fp == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#112: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:327:
+			for (k = j-2; k > 0; k--) {
 			          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#117: FILE: scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:332:
+				const char *prompt = menu_get_prompt(submenu);
+				if (submenu->sym)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
