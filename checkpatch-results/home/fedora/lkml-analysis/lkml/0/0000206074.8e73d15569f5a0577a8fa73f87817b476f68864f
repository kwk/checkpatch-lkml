CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "qc"
#67: FILE: drivers/scsi/libata-core.c:2701:
+	assert(qc != NULL);	/* ata_qc_from_tag _might_ return NULL */

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!qc->waiting"
#68: FILE: drivers/scsi/libata-core.c:2702:
+	assert(qc->waiting == NULL);	/* nothing should be waiting */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#83: FILE: drivers/scsi/libata.h:40:
+extern void ata_qc_free(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
