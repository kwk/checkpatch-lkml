Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#289: FILE: drivers/dlm/lock.c:3181:
+/* A waiting lkb needs recovery if the master node has failed, or
+   the master node is changing (only when no directory is used) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dlm_wait_function', this function's name, in a string
#423: FILE: drivers/dlm/recover.c:64:
+		log_debug(ls, "dlm_wait_function aborted");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#531: FILE: drivers/dlm/recover.c:395:
+		if (dlm_no_directory(ls))
[...]
+		else if (!is_master(r) && dlm_is_removed(ls, r->res_nodeid)) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
