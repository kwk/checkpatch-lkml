Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#114: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:425:
+		if (count == loopcount) {
+			priority--;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#152: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:514:
+				if (try_to_free_pages(GFP_KSWAPD))
+				{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
