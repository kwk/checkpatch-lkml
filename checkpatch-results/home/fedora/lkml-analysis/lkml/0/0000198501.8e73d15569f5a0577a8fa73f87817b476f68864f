ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#75: FILE: drivers/mmc/mmc.c:678:
 		if (host->ocr)
+		{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#77: FILE: drivers/mmc/mmc.c:680:
+		{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#105: FILE: drivers/mmc/Kconfig:30:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
