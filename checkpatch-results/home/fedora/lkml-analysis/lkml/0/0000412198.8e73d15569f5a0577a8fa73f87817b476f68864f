ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#969: FILE: drivers/video/sgivwfb.c:28:
=20

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#991: FILE: drivers/video/sgivwfb.c:50:
+extern unsigned long sgivwfb_mem_size;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#1000: FILE: drivers/video/sgivwfb.c:64:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation
