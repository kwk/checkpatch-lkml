ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#183: FILE: drivers/net/hamradio/baycom_epp.c:613:
+			for (j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#205: FILE: drivers/net/hamradio/baycom_epp.c:635:
+					bitbuf = (bitbuf & ((~0xff) << j)) | ((bitbuf & ~((~0xff) << j)) << 1);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
