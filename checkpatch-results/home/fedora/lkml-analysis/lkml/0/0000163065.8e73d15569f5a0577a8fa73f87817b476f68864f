ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#55: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:504:
+^I                           || (ia_valid & ATTR_GID))$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#68: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:780:
+static struct inode_operations proc_default_inode_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
