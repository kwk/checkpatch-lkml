The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

#55: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device.c:257:

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_RO: Use DEVICE_ATTR_RO
#76: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device.c:468:
+static DEVICE_ATTR(modalias, 0444, modalias_show, NULL);

The DEVICE_ATTR_RO(name) helper macro can be used instead of
DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0444, name_show, NULL);

Note that the macro automatically appends _show to the named
attribute variable of the device for the show method.
