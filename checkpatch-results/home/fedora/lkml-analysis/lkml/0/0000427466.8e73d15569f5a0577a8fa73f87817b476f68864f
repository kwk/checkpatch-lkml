CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#143: FILE: include/linux/vmalloc.h:35:
+extern struct vm_struct *__get_vm_area(unsigned long size, unsigned long flags, int gfp_mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'contingous' may be misspelled - perhaps 'contiguous'?
