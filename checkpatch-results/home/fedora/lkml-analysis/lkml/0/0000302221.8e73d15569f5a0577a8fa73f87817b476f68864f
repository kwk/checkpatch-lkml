M68k: Add missing relocation support to module loader (from Matthias Urlichs)

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Elf32_Rela>
#34: FILE: arch/m68k/kernel/module.c:86:
+	Elf32_Rela *rel = (void *)sechdrs[relsec].sh_addr;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Elf32_Sym>
#35: FILE: arch/m68k/kernel/module.c:87:
+	Elf32_Sym *sym;

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#36: FILE: arch/m68k/kernel/module.c:88:
+	uint32_t *location;

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#45: FILE: arch/m68k/kernel/module.c:97:
+		/* This is the symbol it is referring to.  Note that all
+		   undefined symbols have been resolved.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'postition' may be misspelled - perhaps 'position'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
