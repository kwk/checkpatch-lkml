#74: FILE: include/linux/wait.h:22:
+extern int default_wake_function(wait_queue_t *wait, unsigned mode, int sync,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#83: FILE: include/linux/wait.h:112:
+extern void FASTCALL(__wake_up_info(wait_queue_head_t *q, unsigned int mode, int nr, unsigned long info));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
