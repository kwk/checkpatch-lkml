WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'acpi_memory_match_paddr_to_memdevice', this function's name, in a string
#59: FILE: drivers/acpi/acpi_memhotplug.c:487:
+	ACPI_FUNCTION_TRACE("acpi_memory_match_paddr_to_memdevice\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#69: FILE: drivers/acpi/acpi_memhotplug.c:497:
+	if ((status = acpi_memory_check_device(mem_device)) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#99: FILE: drivers/acpi/acpi_memhotplug.c:527:

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
