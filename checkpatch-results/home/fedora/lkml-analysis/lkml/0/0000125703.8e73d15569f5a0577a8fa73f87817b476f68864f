#53: 
Modify the Slab Allocator to support the addition of a Critical Pool to the VM.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#164: FILE: mm/slab.c:2374:
+		BUG_ON(cachep->flags & SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#199: FILE: mm/slab.c:2407:
+	if (critical && (objp = get_critical_object(cachep, flags)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#219: FILE: mm/slab.c:2460:
+		struct kmem_list3 *l3 = cachep->nodelists[nodeid];
+		spin_lock(&l3->list_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'reenable' may be misspelled - perhaps 're-enable'?
