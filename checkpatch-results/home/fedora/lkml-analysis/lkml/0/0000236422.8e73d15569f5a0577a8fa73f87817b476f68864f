Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_CASTS: unnecessary cast may hide bugs, see http://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#64: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/kprobes.c:44:
+	if (!p->ainsn.insn) {
+		return -ENOMEM;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
