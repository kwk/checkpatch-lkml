WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#43: FILE: ieee1394/video1394.c:863:
+		PRINT_G(KERN_ERR, __FUNCTION__": Unknown video card for minor %d", minor(inode->i_rdev));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#43: FILE: ieee1394/video1394.c:863:
+		PRINT_G(KERN_ERR, __FUNCTION__": Unknown video card for minor %d", minor(inode->i_rdev));

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
