Okay... Added Greg back to the CC. Don't know if he wants to comment or not.

Not significantly. We'd need to seperate the probe() method a bit, so

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

fullfilled. For example, if with the snd-adlib driver no port= is given,

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#249: FILE: sound/isa/adlib.c:133:
+			snd_printk(KERN_ERR DRV_NAME ": could not register device for card %d\n", i);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
