CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#48: FILE: drivers/md/dm-ioctl-v4.c:714:
+	outptr = outbuf = get_result_buffer(param, param_size, &len);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#66: FILE: drivers/md/dm-ioctl-v4.c:732:
+		spec = (struct dm_target_spec *) outptr;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#78: FILE: drivers/md/dm-ioctl-v4.c:744:
+		if (ti->type->status) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
