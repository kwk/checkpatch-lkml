ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#179: FILE: drivers/scsi/libata-core.c:3227:
+ ^I^Iata_tf_to_host_nolock(ap, &qc->tf);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#322: FILE: drivers/scsi/libata-core.c:3590:
+	if (status & ATA_ERR) {
+		ap->pio_task_state = PIO_ST_ERR;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
