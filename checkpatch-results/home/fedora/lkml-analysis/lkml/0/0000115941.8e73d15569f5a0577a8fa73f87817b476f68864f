Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#90: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:89:
+	int zone = ((__force int) gfp & GFP_ZONEMASK) ^ 0x2;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#91: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:90:
+	int zone = ((__force int) gfp & GFP_ZONEMASK) ^ 0x2;
+	BUG_ON(zone >= MAX_NR_ZONES);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#91: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:90:
+	BUG_ON(zone >= MAX_NR_ZONES);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
