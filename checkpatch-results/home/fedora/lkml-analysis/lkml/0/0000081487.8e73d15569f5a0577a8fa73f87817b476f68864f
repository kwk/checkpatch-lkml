CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#62: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/eeh_driver.c:270:
 	if (!frozen_dn) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
