WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+				 * reset itself after the second timeout */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#96: FILE: drivers/char/amd7xx_tco.c:54:
+#define NO_REBOOT	(1 << 10)	/* in DevB:3x48 */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
