Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#62: FILE: ali5455.c:1263:
+    if ((dmabuf->count + free) > dmabuf->dmasize){
+         free = dmabuf->dmasize - dmabuf->count;
+    }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#63: FILE: ali5455.c:1264:
+         free = dmabuf->dmasize - dmabuf->count;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
