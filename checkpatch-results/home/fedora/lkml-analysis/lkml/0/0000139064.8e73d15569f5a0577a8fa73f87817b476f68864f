#30: 
I find two bug yesterday when I was thinking whether ip6_mc_del_src(...) should be called in __ipv6_dev_mc_dec(...).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#81: FILE: net/ipv6/mcast.c:1442:
+^I^I   type == MLD2_CHANGE_TO_EXCLUDE; $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
