#23: 
This patch converts the gameport driver to the pnp changes.  It has been tested.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#30: 
--- a/drivers/input/gameport/ns558.c	Thu Oct 31 00:43:38 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
