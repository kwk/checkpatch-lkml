#59: FILE: include/linux/crc16.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_CRC16_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/linux/crc16.h:8:
+extern u16 crc16(u16 crc, const u8 *buffer, size_t len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#108: FILE: lib/crc16.c:2:
+ *	linux/lib/crc16.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
