Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#45: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ioport.c:113:
+	volatile struct pt_regs * regs = (struct pt_regs *) &unused;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
