WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#94: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:1172:
+	BUG_ON(boot_cpu_physical_apicid != GET_APIC_ID(apic_read(APIC_ID)));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
