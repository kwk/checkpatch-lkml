WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#46: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/user_syms.c:100:
+extern void __stack_smash_handler(void *) __attribute__((weak));

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __weak over __attribute__((weak))

ERROR:WEAK_DECLARATION: Using weak declarations can have unintended link defects
#49: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/user_syms.c:103:
+extern long __guard __attribute__((weak));

Using weak declarations like __attribute__((weak)) or __weak
can have unintended link defects.  Avoid using them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#49: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/user_syms.c:103:
+extern long __guard __attribute__((weak));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#50: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/user_syms.c:104:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(__guard);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
