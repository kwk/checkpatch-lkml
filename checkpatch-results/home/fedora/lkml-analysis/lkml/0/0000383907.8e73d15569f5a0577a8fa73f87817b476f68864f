ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#56: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:367:
+	if (drive == NULL || (rq = HWGROUP(drive)->rq) == NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!drive"
#56: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:367:
+	if (drive == NULL || (rq = HWGROUP(drive)->rq) == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#78: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:389:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ide_abort);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "DRIVER"

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#162: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:758:
+	BUG_ON(!irqs_disabled());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
