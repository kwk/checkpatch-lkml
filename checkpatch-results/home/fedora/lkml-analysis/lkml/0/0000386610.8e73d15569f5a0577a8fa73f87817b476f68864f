The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:WHILE_AFTER_BRACE: while should follow close brace '}'
#218: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:1272:

+	while ((active = del_timer_sync(&new_timer) || 

while should follow the closing bracket on the same line::

  do {
          ...
  } while(something);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
