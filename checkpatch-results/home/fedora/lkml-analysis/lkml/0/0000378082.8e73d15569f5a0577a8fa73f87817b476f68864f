WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'include' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#75: FILE: linux/highmem.h:39:
+	BUG_ON (addr & ~PAGE_MASK);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
