ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#216: FILE: kernel/exit.c:64:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#217: FILE: kernel/exit.c:65:
+	BUG_ON(p->state < TASK_ZOMBIE);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
