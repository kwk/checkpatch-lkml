WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'kjournald', this function's name, in a string
#74: FILE: fs/jbd/journal.c:229:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "kjournald starting.  Commit interval %d seconds\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
