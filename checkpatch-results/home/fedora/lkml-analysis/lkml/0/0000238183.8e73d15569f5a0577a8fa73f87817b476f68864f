CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#155: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/ptrace.c:306:
 {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#182: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/thread_info.h:101:
+#define TIF_SYSCALL_RTOFFLOAD	9	/* hard-realtime task for which
+					   system calls must be offloaded

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#192: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/thread_info.h:114:
+#define _TIF_SYSCALL_RTOFFLOAD	(1<<TIF_SYSCALL_RTOFFLOAD)
                               	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#192: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/thread_info.h:114:
+#define _TIF_SYSCALL_RTOFFLOAD	(1<<TIF_SYSCALL_RTOFFLOAD)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
