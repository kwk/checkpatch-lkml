#36: 
Confirmed.  As Andi says, sorting the exception table does fix the problem.  Tested 2.6.9-rc3 with gcc 3.3.3 and there are no issues.  My major malfunction was working on an older 2.6 kernel and believing the patches were still relevant.  Linus, please revert the following commit, it is no longer needed and do_test_wp_bit is better inlined into __init and subsequently discarded now that exceptions in __init work.

# This is a BitKeeper generated diff -Nru style patch.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
