WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#95: FILE: fs/inode.c:299:
+static int invalidate_list(struct list_head *head, struct list_head *dispose, struct list_head *mark)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#115: FILE: fs/inode.c:321:
+			tmp = next = mark->next;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#127: FILE: fs/inode.c:366:
+	marker = kmalloc(sizeof(*marker), GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_REPEAT);
 	                                            ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
