ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#84: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:181:
+			if((int)atomic_read(&hd->ios_in_flight) < 0)
+			{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

*/

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#88: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:184:
+				/* this happens mysteriously, so here is a cheap workaround
+				atomic_set(&hd->ios_in_flight, 0);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
