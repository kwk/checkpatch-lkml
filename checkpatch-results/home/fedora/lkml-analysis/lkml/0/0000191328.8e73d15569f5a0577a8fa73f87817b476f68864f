CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#101: FILE: linux/suspend.h:51:
+extern int software_resume(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
