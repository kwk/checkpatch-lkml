#29: 
Actually, this seems a better fix. Clearly the unlikely and that particular kmalloc don't play well together. However, the same setup a couple of lines later have no issue.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cache_kobject[cpu]"
#42: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c:575:
+	if (cache_kobject[cpu] == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
