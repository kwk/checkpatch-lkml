WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#70: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1943:
+int cont_prepare_write(struct page *page, unsigned offset, unsigned to, get_block_t *get_block, loff_t *bytes)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
