CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#101: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:61:
+#define i (((unsigned long) mapping) / \

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that '~' (ctx:WxW)

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#122: FILE: fs/buffer.c:116:
+		int nfract;   /* Percentage of buffer cache dirty to 
+				 activate bdflush */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
