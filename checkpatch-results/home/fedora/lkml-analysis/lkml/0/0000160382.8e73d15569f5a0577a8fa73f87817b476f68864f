WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#487: FILE: drivers/media/video/tvaudio.c:1101:
+	if (chip->c.adapter->id == I2C_HW_B_RIVA) {
 		memcpy (desc->inputmap, inputmap, sizeof (inputmap));
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.

spaces are never used for indentation.
