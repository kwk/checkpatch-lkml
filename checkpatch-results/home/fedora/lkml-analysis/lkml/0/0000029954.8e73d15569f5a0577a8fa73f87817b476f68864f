WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct vm_area_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#38: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1107:
+int vm_insert_pfn(struct vm_area_struct *, unsigned long addr, unsigned long pfn);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment
#67: FILE: mm/memory.c:1287:
+	spinlock_t *ptl;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#69: FILE: mm/memory.c:1289:
+	BUG_ON(is_cow_mapping(vma->vm_flags));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
