The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#214: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/fault.c:453:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 118 exceeds 100 columns
#244: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:723:
+extern int __handle_mm_fault(struct mm_struct *mm,struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long address, int access_mask);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#244: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:723:
+extern int __handle_mm_fault(struct mm_struct *mm,struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long address, int access_mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#298: FILE: mm/memory.c:1937:
+static inline int check_perms(struct vm_area_struct * vma, int access_mask) {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#298: FILE: mm/memory.c:1937:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
