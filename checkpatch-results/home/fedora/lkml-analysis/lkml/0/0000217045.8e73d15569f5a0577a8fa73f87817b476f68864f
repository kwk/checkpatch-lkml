WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#165: FILE: include/asm-alpha/page.h:21:
+#define alloc_zeroed_user_highpage(vma, vaddr) alloc_page_vma(GFP_HIGHUSER | __GFP_ZERO, vma, vmaddr)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

+static inline struct page* alloc_zeroed_user_highpage(struct vm_area_struct *vma,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
