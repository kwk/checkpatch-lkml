ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#65: FILE: drivers/char/synclink_gt.c:4319:
+	case HDLC_CRC_16_CCITT: crc_size = 2; break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#66: FILE: drivers/char/synclink_gt.c:4320:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
