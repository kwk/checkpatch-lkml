Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#84: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs.h:72:
+extern int fsync_file(int fd, int datasync);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
