CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:150:
+extern void oom_kill_finish(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/bitops.h> instead of <asm/bitops.h>
#94: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:24:
+#include <asm/bitops.h>

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#98: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:28:
+volatile unsigned long oom_kill_in_progress = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#98: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:28:
+volatile unsigned long oom_kill_in_progress = 0;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mm"
#135: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:290:
+	if (mm == NULL || mm == &init_mm) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#183: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:354:
+	printk("oom-killer: gfp_mask=0x%x, order=%d\n", gfp_mask, order);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#195: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:368:
+		cancel = oom_kill_process(current, points,
 				"No available memory (MPOL_BIND)");

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#201: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:373:
+		cancel = oom_kill_process(current, points,
 				"No available memory in cpuset");
