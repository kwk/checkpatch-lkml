CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: ipc/shm.c:466:
+		shminfo.shmmni = shminfo.shmseg = context->ctlmni;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

+void *shm_ctlall_helper(void)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files

+extern void *shm_ctlall_helper(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
