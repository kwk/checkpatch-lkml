ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#40: 
--- a/drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c	Tue Mar 16 13:19:47 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#78: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:134:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
