WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#78: FILE: lk-changelog.pl:11:
+# $Id: lk-changelog.pl,v 0.324 2004/10/19 01:59:56 emma Exp $

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'kenrel' may be misspelled - perhaps 'kernel'?
#145: FILE: lk-changelog.pl:378:
+'benh:kenrel.crashing.org' => 'Benjamin Herrenschmidt', # typo

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
