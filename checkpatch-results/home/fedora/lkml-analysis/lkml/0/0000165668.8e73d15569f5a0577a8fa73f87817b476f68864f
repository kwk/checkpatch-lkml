#26: 
as mention in Dave Jones keynote at OLS.  This is done by adding a new flag, 

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:82:
+		extern void __your_kmalloc_flags_are_not_valid(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
