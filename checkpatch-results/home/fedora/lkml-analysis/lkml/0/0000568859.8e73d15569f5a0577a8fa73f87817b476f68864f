ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#121: FILE: char/nvram.c:251:
 	for( ; count-- > 0 && i < NVRAM_BYTES; ++i, ++tmp )

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
