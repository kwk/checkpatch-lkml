CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#41: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:944:
+extern void truncate_complete_page(struct address_space *mapping,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
