CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#163: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1128:
+extern void rt_mutex_adjust_pi(task_t *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#169: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1134:
 }
+# define rt_mutex_adjust_pi(p)		do { } while (0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
