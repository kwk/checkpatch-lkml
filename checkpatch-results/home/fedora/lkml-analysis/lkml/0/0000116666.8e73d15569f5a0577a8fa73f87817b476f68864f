+	ssize_t (*write) (struct file *, const char __user *, size_t, loff_t *))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#67: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/sn2/sn_proc_fs.c:102:
+		struct file_operations *f;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
