WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#63: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#64: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:2:
+ * arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#87: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:25:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#88: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:26:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!task"
#160: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:98:
+	if (task == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#209: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:147:
+		if (kgdb_hex2long(&ptr, &addr)) {
[...]
+		} else if (compiled_break == 1) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct kgdb_arch should normally be const
#264: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/kgdb.c:202:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

+static int __initdata osk_serial_ports[OMAP_MAX_NR_PORTS] = {1, 1, 1};

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
