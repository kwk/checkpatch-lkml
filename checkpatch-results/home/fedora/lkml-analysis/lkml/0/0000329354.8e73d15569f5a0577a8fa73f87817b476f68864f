> arch/i386/kernel/microcode.c:329: `ext_tablep' undeclared (first use in this

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#67: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/microcode.c:329:
+						ext_tablep = (((void *) newmc) + MC_HEADER_SIZE + data_size);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
