#33: 
multiple VP7045-based device at the same time on one system. Using kmalloc'd

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dvb_frontend_ops should normally be const
#51: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/vp7045-fe.c:26:
+	struct dvb_frontend_ops ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
