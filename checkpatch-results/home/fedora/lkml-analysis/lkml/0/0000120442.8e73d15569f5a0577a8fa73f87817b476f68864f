- for cpu running time, use tsk->sched_info.cpu_time (collected by schedstats)

exit, atleast for stats collection purposes.
      ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#79: FILE: drivers/connector/Kconfig:21:
+config STATS_CONNECTOR
+	bool "Report per-task statistics to userspace"
+	depends on CONNECTOR=y && TASK_DELAY_ACCT
+	---help---
+	  Provide a connector interface that reports per-task statistics to
+	  userspace. While a task is running, userspace can get the stats by
+	  sending a command to the connector. At task exit, the final value of
+	  the stats is sent automatically.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#104: FILE: include/linux/cn_stats.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#127: FILE: include/linux/cn_stats.h:24:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#142: FILE: include/linux/cn_stats.h:39:
+struct cnstats_data {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
