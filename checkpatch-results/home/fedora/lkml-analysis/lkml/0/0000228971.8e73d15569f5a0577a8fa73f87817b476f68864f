WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#60: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco_plx.c:178:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#63: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco_plx.c:181:
+    memcpy_fromio(magic, attr_mem, 16);$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#66: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco_plx.c:184:
+    for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) {$

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#66: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco_plx.c:184:
+    for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
+        magic[i] = magic[i] & 0x00ff;
+    }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#67: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/orinoco_plx.c:185:
+        magic[i] = magic[i] & 0x00ff;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
