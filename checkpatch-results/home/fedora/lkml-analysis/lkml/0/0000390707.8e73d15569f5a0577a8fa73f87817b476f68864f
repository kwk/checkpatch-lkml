ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#28: 
--- a/drivers/hotplug/cpqphp.h	Mon Feb 24 17:15:46 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: drivers/hotplug/cpqphp.h:407:
+extern void cpqhp_create_ctrl_files		(struct controller *ctrl);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+static DEVICE_ATTR (ctrl, S_IRUGO, show_ctrl, NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
