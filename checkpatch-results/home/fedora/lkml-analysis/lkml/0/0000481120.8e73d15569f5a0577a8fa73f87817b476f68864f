CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#203: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:100:
+extern void wake_up_page(struct page *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#249: FILE: mm/filemap.c:790:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#264: FILE: mm/filemap.c:805:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#317: FILE: mm/filemap.c:853:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
