Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "handler"
#98: FILE: drivers/macintosh/adb.c:591:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
