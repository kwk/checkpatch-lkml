+	select SOFTWARE_SUSPEND2
+	---help---
+	  Software Suspend 2 is the 'new and improved' suspend support. You
+	  can now build it as modules, but be aware that this requires
+	  initrd support (the modules you use in saving the image have to
+	  be loaded in order for you to be able to resume!)
+	  
+	  See the Software Suspend home page (softwaresuspend.berlios.de)
+	  for FAQs, HOWTOs and other documentation.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

+				select ZLIB_INFLATE
+				---help---
+				  This option enables compression of pages stored during Software Suspend
+				  process. Pages are compressed using the zlib library, with a default
+				  setting (in code) of fastest compression (still VERY slow!). If your swap
+				  device is painfully slow compared to your CPU, you might possibly want
+				  this. Then again, you might just want to upgrade your storage (if you
+				  can).

+				  Just in case you haven't gotten the hint yet, this option should be off
+				  for most people. If will make your computer take a minute to suspend

+				depends on SOFTWARE_SUSPEND2_CORE && BLK_DEV_DM
+				---help---
+				  This option creates a module which allows Suspend to tell the
+				  device mapper code to allocate enough memory for its work while
+				  suspending. It doesn't do anything else, but without it, dm-crypt
+				  won't work properly.
+
+				  This option should be off for most people.

+				  can set the progress bar value and switch between silent and verbose

+			config SOFTWARE_SUSPEND_KEEP_IMAGE
+				bool '   Allow Keep Image Mode'
+				---help---
+				  This option allows you to keep and image and reuse it. It is intended
+				  __ONLY__ for use with systems where all filesystems are mounted read-
+				  only (kiosks, for example). To use it, compile this option in and boot
+				  normally. Set the KEEP_IMAGE flag in /proc/software_suspend and suspend.
+				  When you resume, the image will not be removed. You will be unable to turn
+				  off swap partitions (assuming you are using the swap writer), but future
+				  suspends simply do a power-down. The image can be updated using the
+				  kernel command line parameter suspend_act= to turn off the keep image
+				  bit. Keep image mode is a little less user friendly on purpose - it
+				  should not be used without thought!
