WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#157: FILE: mm/swap.c:265:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:MINMAX: min() should probably be min_t(unsigned long, nr_active, sc->swap_cluster_max)
#589: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:613:
+		sc->nr_to_scan = min(nr_active,
 				     (unsigned long)sc->swap_cluster_max);
