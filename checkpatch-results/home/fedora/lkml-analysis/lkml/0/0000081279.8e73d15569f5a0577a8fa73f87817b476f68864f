#26: 
Rename actually_do_remove() to remove_files_and_dir(), make it call closedir(),

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!directory"
#74: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/umid.c:85:
+	if (directory == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#126: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/umid.c:198:
+		printk("is_umdir_used - remove_files_and_dir failed with "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'remove_umid_dir', this function's name, in a string
#138: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/umid.c:380:
+		printf("remove_umid_dir - remove_files_and_dir failed with "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
