WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#50: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c:2649:
+static int idetape_copy_stage_from_user (idetape_tape_t *tape, idetape_stage_t *stage, const char __user *buf, int n)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
