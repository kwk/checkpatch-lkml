WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#54: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:304:
+	volatile int counter;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#78: FILE: kernel/fork.c:674:
+		int counter = current->counter;
+		p->counter = (counter + 1) >> 1;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
