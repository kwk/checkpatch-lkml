WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#122: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:352:
+		BUG_ON(!PageAnon(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#132: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:362:
+int try_to_unmap_hugepage(struct page *page, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
+				struct list_head *force)

+	BUG_ON(!vma);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#162: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:392:
+#if 0 $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:IF_0: Consider removing the code enclosed by this #if 0 and its #endif
#162: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:392:
+#if 0 

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#163: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:393:
+	if ((vma->vm_flags & (VM_LOCKED|VM_RESERVED)) ||
 	                               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
