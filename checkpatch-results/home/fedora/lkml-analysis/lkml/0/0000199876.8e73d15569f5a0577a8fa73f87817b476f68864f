ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#128: FILE: drivers/net/wan/farsync.c:80:
+static int fst_excluded_cards = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

+static int dma_get_rx_frame_size(pc300_t * card, int ch)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
