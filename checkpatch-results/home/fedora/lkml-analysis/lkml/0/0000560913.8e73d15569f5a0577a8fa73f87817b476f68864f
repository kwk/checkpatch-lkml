WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#85: FILE: include/linux/tqueue.h:58:
+ * ^Iroutine: (void (*)(void *)) my_routine,$

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#141: FILE: include/linux/tqueue.h:98:
+extern void __run_task_queue(task_queue *list);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#182: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:304:
+		void (*f) (void *);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#182: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:304:
+		void (*f) (void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#188: FILE: kernel/softirq.c:310:
+		next->prev->next = next->prev->prev = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
