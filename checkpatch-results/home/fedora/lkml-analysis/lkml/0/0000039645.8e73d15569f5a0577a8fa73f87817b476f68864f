WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 122 exceeds 100 columns
#114: FILE: drivers/usb/core/inode.c:702:
+			kill_pid_info_as_uid(ds->discsignr, &sinfo, ds->disc_pid, ds->disc_uid, ds->disc_euid, ds->secid);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#139: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1306:
+extern int kill_pid_info_as_uid(int, struct siginfo *, struct pid *, uid_t, uid_t, u32);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#139: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1306:
+extern int kill_pid_info_as_uid(int, struct siginfo *, struct pid *, uid_t, uid_t, u32);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
