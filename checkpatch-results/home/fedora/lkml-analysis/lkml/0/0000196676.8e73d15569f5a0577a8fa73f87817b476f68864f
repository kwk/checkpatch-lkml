ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#83: FILE: drivers/scsi/advansys.c:9202:
+        (unsigned) s->serial_number, s->retries, s->allowed);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#83: FILE: drivers/scsi/advansys.c:9202:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ncr53c8xx_abort', this function's name, in a string
#115: FILE: drivers/scsi/ncr53c8xx.c:7604:
+	printk("ncr53c8xx_abort: pid=%lu serial_number=%ld\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
