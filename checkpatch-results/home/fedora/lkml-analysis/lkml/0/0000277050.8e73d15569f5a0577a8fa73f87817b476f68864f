#28: 
__get_free_pages had a hack to do node interleaving allocation at boot time.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#46: FILE: include/linux/mempolicy.h:156:
+extern void numa_default_policy(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
