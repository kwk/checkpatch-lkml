WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#82: FILE: kernel/timer.c:370:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#122: FILE: kernel/timer.c:558:
+		BUG_ON(TBASE_GET_BASE_PTR(timer->base) != base);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
