code in a number of places and eliminates an unecessary set of
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#106: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/imalloc.h:7:
+#define PHBS_IO_BASE  ^I  VMALLOC_END$

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#119: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/imalloc.h:22:
+extern void im_free(void *addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#313: FILE: arch/ppc64/mm/init.c:164:
+		set_pte_at(&init_mm, ea, ptep, pfn_pte(pa >> PAGE_SHIFT,
 							  __pgprot(flags)));

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/cacheflush.h> instead of <asm/cacheflush.h>
#378: FILE: arch/ppc64/mm/imalloc.c:18:
+#include <asm/cacheflush.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#387: FILE: arch/ppc64/mm/imalloc.c:289:
+void im_free(void * addr)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
