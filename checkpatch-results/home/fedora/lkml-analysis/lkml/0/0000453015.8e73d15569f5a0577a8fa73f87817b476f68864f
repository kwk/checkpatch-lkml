The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:74:
+extern void open_softirq(int nr, void (*action)(int cpu));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
