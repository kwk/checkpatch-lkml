CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#77: FILE: drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_DAC1064.c:426:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#112: FILE: drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_DAC1064.c:950:
+static inline void g450_preinit(WPMINFO2) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
