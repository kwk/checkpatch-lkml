CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'b2' - possible side-effects?

+#define BIOVEC_SEG_BOUNDARY(limits, b1, b2) \

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#148: FILE: include/linux/bio.h:170:
+	__BIO_SEG_BOUNDARY(bvec_to_phys((b1)), bvec_to_phys((b2)) + (b2)->bv_len, (limits)->seg_boundary_mask)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
