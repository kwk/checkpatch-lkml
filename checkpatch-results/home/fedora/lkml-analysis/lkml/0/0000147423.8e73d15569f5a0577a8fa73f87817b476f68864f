ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#37: FILE: drivers/video/cyblafb.c:415:
+			out32(GE9C,*(u32*)p);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
