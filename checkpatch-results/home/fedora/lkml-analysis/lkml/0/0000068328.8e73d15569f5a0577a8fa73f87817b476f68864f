Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo*	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#219: FILE: include/linux/nsc_gpio.h:32:
+	struct device*	dev;	/* for dev_dbg() support, set in init  */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#228: FILE: include/linux/nsc_gpio.h:41:
+extern void nsc_gpio_dump(struct nsc_gpio_ops *amp, unsigned index);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
