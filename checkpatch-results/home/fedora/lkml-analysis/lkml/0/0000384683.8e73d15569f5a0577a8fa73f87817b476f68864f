CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#190: FILE: drivers/char/genrtc.c:462:
+	tm.tm_hour = tm.tm_min = tm.tm_sec = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#287: FILE: include/asm-m68k/rtc.h:54:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
