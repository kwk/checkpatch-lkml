WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#91: FILE: net/core/net-sysfs.c:458:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(netdev_register_interface);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#101: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:957:
+extern int netdev_register_interface(struct class_interface *intf);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
