ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#77: FILE: fat/file.c:87:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
