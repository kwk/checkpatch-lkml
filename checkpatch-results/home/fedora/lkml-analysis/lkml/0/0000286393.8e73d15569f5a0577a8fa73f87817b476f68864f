WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#84: FILE: drivers/net/r8169.c:1448:
+			const struct iphdr *ip = skb->nh.iph;
+			if (ip->protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#89: FILE: drivers/net/r8169.c:1453:
+				BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
