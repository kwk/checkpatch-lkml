WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'wv_set_frequency', this function's name, in a string

+	  printk(KERN_INFO "Wavelan: wv_set_frequency : unable to write new frequency to EEprom (?)\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#78: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/wavelan_cs.c:1984:
+       * (does it work for everybody ? - especially old cards...) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

spaces are never used for indentation.
