ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#81: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:1577:
+^Iif (!is_sync_wait(wait)) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#95: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:1590:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#106: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:393:
+extern int blk_congestion_wait_wq(int rw, long timeout, wait_queue_t *wait);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#134: FILE: mm/filemap.c:427:
+struct page *find_lock_page_wq(struct address_space *mapping,
+				unsigned long offset, wait_queue_t *wait)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
