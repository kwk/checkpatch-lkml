ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#37: 
--- a/net/ipv6/af_inet6.c	2004-12-07 10:02:50 -08:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct proto_ops should normally be const
#43: FILE: net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:516:
+struct proto_ops inet6_raw_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#51: FILE: net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:524:
+^I.getname =^Iinet6_getname, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
