#24: 
for some time I was not able to compile a kernel with ramdisk support but with the following patch it works again!

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'arch' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#36: FILE: i386/kernel/setup.c:665:
+       extern int rd_size, rd_image_start, rd_prompt, rd_doload;$

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#36: FILE: i386/kernel/setup.c:665:
+       extern int rd_size, rd_image_start, rd_prompt, rd_doload;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
