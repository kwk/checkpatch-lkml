ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#182: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:310:
+extern void touch_light_softlockup_watchdog(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#190: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:321:
 }
+static inline void touch_light_softlockup_watchdog(void)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
