ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#103: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:29:
+ *  $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#119: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:173:
+extern struct sysrq_ctls_struct sysrq_ctls;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#137: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:264:
+	/*
+	  Pressing magic + command key acts as a chorded command.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#144: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:271:
+        if (sysrq_ctls.enabled) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

switch should be at the same indent as case.

  switch (suffix) {

  case 'g':

          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#145: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:272:
+		if (keycode == sysrq_ctls.keycode) switch(sysrq_state) {

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#154: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:281:
+					if (sysrq_ctls.sticky) {
[...]
+					} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
