fs/mpage.c.  Andrew, I believe it this accomodates all of your
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'accomodate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'accommodate'?
#26: 
This should accomodate any drivers that set max_sectors == 0.
            ^^^^^^^^^^

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:431:
+extern int bio_max_iovecs(request_queue_t *q, int *iovec_size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#77: FILE: fs/bio.c:319:
+	unsigned max_iovecs = min(q->max_phys_segments, q->max_hw_segments);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#81: FILE: fs/bio.c:323:
+		unsigned int max_bytes = q->max_sectors << 9;
+		if (*iovec_size > max_bytes) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#128: FILE: fs/bio.c:398:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
