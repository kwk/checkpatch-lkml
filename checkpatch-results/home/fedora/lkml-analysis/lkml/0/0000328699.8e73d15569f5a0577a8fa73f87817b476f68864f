WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated
#45: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.c:4:
+ *   $Revision: 1.51 $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*dev)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct device)...)
#71: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.c:257:
+	dev = kmalloc(sizeof(struct device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:MINMAX: min() should probably be min_t(size_t, strlen(name), BUS_ID_SIZE)

+	strncpy(dev->bus_id, name, min(strlen(name), (size_t)BUS_ID_SIZE));

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#96: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.c:281:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(s390_root_dev_unregister);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#178: FILE: drivers/s390/net/iucv.c:29:
  * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#398: FILE: include/asm-s390/ccwdev.h:170:
+extern struct device *s390_root_dev_register(const char *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const char *' should also have an identifier name
#398: FILE: include/asm-s390/ccwdev.h:170:
+extern struct device *s390_root_dev_register(const char *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
