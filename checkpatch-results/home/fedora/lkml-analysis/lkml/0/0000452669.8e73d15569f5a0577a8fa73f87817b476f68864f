Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space

--- a/arch/alpha/kernel/osf_sys.c	Mon Jun  3 03:52:10 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
