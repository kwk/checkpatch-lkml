WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#109: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:76:
+extern int pc98;	/* NEC PC-9800 subarchitecture or not */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#144: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:757:
+				unsigned long end = max_low_pfn * PAGE_SIZE;
+				if (mpf->mpf_physptr + size > end)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#172: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:804:
+		unsigned int address = *(unsigned short *)phys_to_virt(0x40E);
+		address <<= 4;

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#175: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:807:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "WARNING: MP table in the EBDA can be UNSAFE, contact linux-smp@vger.kernel.org if you experience SMP problems!\n");

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#205: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:844:
+	*((volatile unsigned long *) phys_to_virt(0x404)) = 0x000003f0;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#205: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:844:
+	*((volatile unsigned long *) phys_to_virt(0x404)) = 0x000003f0;

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Dprintk>
#206: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:845:
+	Dprintk("4.\n");

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
