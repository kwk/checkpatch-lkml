ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#67: FILE: kernel/futex.c:662:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#69: FILE: kernel/futex.c:664:
+int futex_uses_fusyn = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#95: FILE: kernel/futex.c:670:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#116: FILE: kernel/futex.c:691:
+			ret = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#119: FILE: kernel/futex.c:694:
+	}
+	else {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#119: FILE: kernel/futex.c:694:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
