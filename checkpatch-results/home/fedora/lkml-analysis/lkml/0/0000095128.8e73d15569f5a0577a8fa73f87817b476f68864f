CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#86: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:27:
+extern unsigned long long __delayacct_blkio_ticks(struct task_struct *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct task_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#86: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:27:
+extern unsigned long long __delayacct_blkio_ticks(struct task_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#94: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:53:
 }
+static inline unsigned long long delayacct_blkio_ticks(struct task_struct *tsk)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
