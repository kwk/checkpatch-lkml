Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#110: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#111: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:2:
+ * kernel/power/suspend_dm.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'informaton' may be misspelled - perhaps 'information'?
#162: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:53:
+ * Description:	Save informaton needed when reloading the image at resume time.
                	     ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#167: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:58:
+static int suspend_dm_save_config_info(char * buffer)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#174: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:65:
+ * Description:^IReload information needed for decompressing the image at $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#175: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:66:

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#182: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:73:
+	BUG_ON(size);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
#184: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:75:

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#222: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:113:
+	if (!(result = suspend_register_plugin(&suspend_dm_ops))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#223: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:114:

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#232: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:123:

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#237: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_dm.c:128:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
