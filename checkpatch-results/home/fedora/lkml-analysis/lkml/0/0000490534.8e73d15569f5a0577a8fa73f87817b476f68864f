WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'delcared' may be misspelled - perhaps 'declared'?
#42: 
delcared as asmlinkage int FASTCALL in arch/i386/kernel/signal.c, but
^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#83: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/signal.c:31:
+int FASTCALL(do_signal(struct pt_regs *regs, sigset_t *oldset));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
