#36: FILE: drivers/leds/trig_timer.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#68: FILE: drivers/leds/trig_timer.c:33:
+	struct led_device *led_dev = (struct led_device *) data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#108: FILE: drivers/leds/trig_timer.c:73:
+	unsigned long state = simple_strtoul(buf, &after, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#109: FILE: drivers/leds/trig_timer.c:74:
+	unsigned long state = simple_strtoul(buf, &after, 10);
+	if (after - buf > 0) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*timer_data)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct timer_trig_data)...)
#126: FILE: drivers/leds/trig_timer.c:91:
+	timer_data = kmalloc(sizeof(struct timer_trig_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#177: FILE: drivers/leds/Kconfig:25:
+config LEDS_TRIGGER_TIMER
+	tristate "LED Timer Trigger"

+	help
+	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a programmable timer

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
