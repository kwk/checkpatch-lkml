ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#51: FILE: arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_backlight.c:29:
+static void* backlighter_data;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
