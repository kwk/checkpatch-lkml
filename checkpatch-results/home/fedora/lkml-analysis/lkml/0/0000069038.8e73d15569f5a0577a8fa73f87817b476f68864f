ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#80: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/setup.c:177:
+	static int register_done __initdata = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#92: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/setup.c:189:
