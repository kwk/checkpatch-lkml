                 ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#105: FILE: drivers/acpi/osl.c:1161:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(max_cstate);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cx->promotion.state <= max_cstate'
#146: FILE: drivers/acpi/processor.c:476:
+	if (cx->promotion.state && (cx->promotion.state <= max_cstate)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#159: FILE: drivers/acpi/processor.c:516:
+	if (pr->power.state > max_cstate) {
+		next_state = max_cstate;
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
