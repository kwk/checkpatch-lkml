CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#73: FILE: include/asm-ppc/tlbflush.h:65:
+extern void flush_tlb_page_nohash(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
