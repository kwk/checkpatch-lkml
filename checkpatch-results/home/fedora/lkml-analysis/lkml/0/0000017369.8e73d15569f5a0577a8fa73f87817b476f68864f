CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#170: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2948:
+	p->timestamp = rq->most_recent_timestamp = now;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
