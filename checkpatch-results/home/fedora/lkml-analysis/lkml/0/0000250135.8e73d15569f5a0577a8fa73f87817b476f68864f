CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#111: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:959:
+extern int cond_resched(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#155: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3560:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(cond_resched);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
