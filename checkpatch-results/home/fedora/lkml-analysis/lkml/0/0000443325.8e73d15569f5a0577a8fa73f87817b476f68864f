ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#46: 
--- a/drivers/input/evdev.c	Tue Jul 30 15:21:38 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

+				if (copy_to_user((void *) arg, &abs, sizeof(struct input_absinfo)))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#85: FILE: drivers/input/evdev.c:398:
+				if (copy_from_user(&abs, (void *) arg, sizeof(struct input_absinfo)))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
