The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#257: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:952:
+	highstart_pfn = highend_pfn = max_pfn;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#258: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:953:
+	if (max_pfn > max_low_pfn) {
+		highstart_pfn = max_low_pfn;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
