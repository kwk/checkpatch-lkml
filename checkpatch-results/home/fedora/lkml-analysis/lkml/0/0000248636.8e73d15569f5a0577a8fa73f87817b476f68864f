WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#54: FILE: fs/devpts/inode.c:25:
+extern struct xattr_handler devpts_xattr_security_handler;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#59: FILE: fs/devpts/inode.c:30:
+#endif^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#63: FILE: fs/devpts/inode.c:34:
+struct inode_operations devpts_file_inode_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
