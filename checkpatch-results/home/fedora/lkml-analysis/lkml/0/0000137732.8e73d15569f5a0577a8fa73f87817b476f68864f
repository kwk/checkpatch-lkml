When we modified the code to accomodate CPU hotplug, there was an 
                             ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:36:
+extern int current_in_cpu_hotplug(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#167: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:38:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(current_in_cpu_hotplug);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#169: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:40:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
