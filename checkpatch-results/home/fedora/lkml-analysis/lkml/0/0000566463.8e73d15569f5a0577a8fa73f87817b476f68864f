CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/asm-i386/page.h:91:
+extern void do_BUG(const char *file, int line);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#112: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:81:
+extern unsigned volatile int global_irq_lock;

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#199: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:418:
+	static unsigned int	last_irq_sums [NR_CPUS],

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

#228: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:445:

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#243: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/i386_ksyms.c:161:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(do_BUG);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#259: FILE: drivers/char/console.c:2665:
+	if (blankinterval && !oops_in_progress) {
 		mod_timer(&console_timer, jiffies + blankinterval);
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
