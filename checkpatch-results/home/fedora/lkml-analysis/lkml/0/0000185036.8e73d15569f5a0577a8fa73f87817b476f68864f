Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

+		cpu_set(smp_processor_id(), *(cpumask_t*)non0cores);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
