#34: 
alloc_dma_rcv_ctx is called in interrupt and Kernel Spinlock debugging code cribs about it via "Debug: sleeping function called in interrupt context". See sample stack traces below.

+       d->buf_cpu = kmalloc(d->num_desc * sizeof(quadlet_t*), GFP_ATOMIC);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.
