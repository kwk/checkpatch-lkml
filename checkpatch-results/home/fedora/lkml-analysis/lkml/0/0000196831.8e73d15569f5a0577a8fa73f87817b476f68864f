WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#24: 
From: "Catalin(ux aka Dino) BOIE" <util@deuroconsult.ro>, Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>, Jeff Dike <jdike@addtoit.com>

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'add_arg', this function's name, in a string
#63: FILE: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c:50:
+		printf("add_arg: Too much command line!\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#66: FILE: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c:53:
+	if(strlen(command_line) > 0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#93: FILE: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c:452:
+ ^Istrlcpy(saved_command_line, command_line, COMMAND_LINE_SIZE);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#93: FILE: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c:452:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#93: FILE: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c:452:

WARNING:STRLCPY: Prefer strscpy over strlcpy - see: https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAHk-=wgfRnXz0W3D37d01q3JFkr_i_uTL=V6A6G1oUZcprmknw@mail.gmail.com/

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#146: FILE: include/asm-um/setup.h:5:
+ * command line, so this choice is ok.*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#191: FILE: arch/um/include/user_util.h:70:
+extern void add_arg(char *arg);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
