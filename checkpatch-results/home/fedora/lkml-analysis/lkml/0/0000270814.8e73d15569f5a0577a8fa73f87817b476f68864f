Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#120: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:471:
+	BUG_ON(!pte);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#134: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:485:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#145: FILE: arch/i386/mm/pageattr.c:20:
+pte_t *lookup_address(unsigned long address) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#161: FILE: include/asm-i386/pgtable.h:353:
+extern pte_t *lookup_address(unsigned long address);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
