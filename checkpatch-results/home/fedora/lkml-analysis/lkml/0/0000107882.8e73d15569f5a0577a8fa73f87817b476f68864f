The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#84: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-locomo.c:20:
+static void locomoled_brightness_set(struct led_classdev *led_cdev, enum led_brightness value, int offset)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#148: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-locomo.c:84:
+static int __init locomoled_init(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
