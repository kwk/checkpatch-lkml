WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#86: FILE: fs/aio.c:728:
+	BUG_ON(!is_sync_wait(current->io_wait));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
