Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
