CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#132: FILE: include/linux/skbuff.h:593:
+extern void skb_queue_head_init_key(struct sk_buff_head *list,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#152: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:90:
+	list->prev = list->next = (struct sk_buff *)list;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
