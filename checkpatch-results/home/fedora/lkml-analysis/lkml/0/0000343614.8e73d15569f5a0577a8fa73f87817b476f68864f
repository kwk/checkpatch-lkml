CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#52: FILE: sched.c:787:
+	node = pnode = cpu_to_node(best_cpu);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#63: FILE: sched.c:795:
+		load = NR_CPUS * (atomic_read(&node_nr_running[i]) + (i != pnode)) / nr_cpus_node(i);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#63: FILE: sched.c:795:
+		load = NR_CPUS * (atomic_read(&node_nr_running[i]) + (i != pnode)) / nr_cpus_node(i);
