CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#41: FILE: arch/i386/mm/discontig.c:324:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+			unsigned long lmem_map;
+			lmem_map = (unsigned long)node_remap_start_vaddr[nid];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
