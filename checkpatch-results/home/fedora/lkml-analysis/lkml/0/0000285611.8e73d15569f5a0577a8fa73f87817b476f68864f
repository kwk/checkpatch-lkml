ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_CPU_PRESENT_MAP' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#302: FILE: include/asm-ia64/cpumask.h:4:
+#define ARCH_HAS_CPU_PRESENT_MAP

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#358: FILE: include/linux/cpumask.h:48:
+#define cpu_present(cpu)		({ BUG_ON((cpu) != 0); 1; })

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#383: FILE: init/main.c:157:
+	if (strcmp(str, "on") == 0) {
[...]
+	} else if (strcmp(str, "off") == 0) {

[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
