CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#80: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-viapro.c:111:
+#define FEATURE_I2CBLOCK	(1<<0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:IF_0: Consider removing the code enclosed by this #if 0 and its #endif

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#145: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-viapro.c:424:
+		/* VT82C686B (rev 0x40) does support I2C block mode, but
+		   VT82C686A (rev 0x30) doesn't. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
