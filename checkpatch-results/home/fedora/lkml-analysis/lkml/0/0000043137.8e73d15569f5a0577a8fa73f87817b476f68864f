#33: 
referring to my own question (and to Jeff Mahoneys email), would it be sufficient to simply change

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#47: FILE: fs/partitions/sun.c:81:
in order to get rid of the meaningless negative numbers? If possible this would be highly preferrable over a solution that renders this partition useless. If Sun Os cannot handle this, maybe an error message when configuring such a disk would be helpful.

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.
