WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#58: FILE: net/sunrpc/clnt.c:991:
+				error = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'call_verify', this function's name, in a string

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
