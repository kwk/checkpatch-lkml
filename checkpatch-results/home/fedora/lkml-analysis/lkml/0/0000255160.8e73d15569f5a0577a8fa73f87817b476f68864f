CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <myTimeval>
#77: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/time.c:446:
+	err = security_settime(&myTimeval, NULL);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#112: FILE: include/linux/security.h:42:
+extern int cap_settime (struct timespec *ts, struct timezone *tz);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#112: FILE: include/linux/security.h:42:
+extern int cap_settime (struct timespec *ts, struct timezone *tz);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#121: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1004:
+ *^ICheck permission to change the system time. $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#133: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1044:

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#146: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1305:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
