CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#83: FILE: include/asm-frv/highmem.h:143:
+	asm volatile("movgs gr0,dampr"#ampr"\n" ::: "memory");		\

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#91: FILE: include/asm-frv/highmem.h:148:
+#define __kunmap_atomic_secondary(slot, vaddr)				\
+do {									\
+	asm volatile("tlbpr %0,gr0,#4,#1" : : "r"(vaddr) : "memory");	\
 } while(0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
