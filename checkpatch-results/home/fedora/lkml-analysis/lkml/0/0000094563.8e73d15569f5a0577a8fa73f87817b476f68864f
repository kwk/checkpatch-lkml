#34: 
During some heavy testing on a single-HDD UP P3/700 my instrumentation showed

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#74: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:375:
+	unsigned wrap = 0; /* bit mask: requests behind the disk head? */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#114: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:419:
+	 * check two variables for all permutations: --> faster! */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#115: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:420:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#117: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:422:
+			if (d1 < d2)
[...]
+			else if (d2 < d1)
[...]
+			else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#121: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:426:

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
