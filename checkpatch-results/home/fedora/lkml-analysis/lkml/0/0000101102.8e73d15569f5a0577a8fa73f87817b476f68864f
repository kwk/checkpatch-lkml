ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#76: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:515:
+static inline struct hrtimer * hrtimer_get_next(struct hrtimer_base *bases)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cur"

+		if (cur == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#203: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:118:
+extern int hrtimer_next_jiffie(unsigned long *next_jiffie);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
