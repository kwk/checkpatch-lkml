Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#163: FILE: include/linux/spi/spi.h:131:
+extern int spi_register_driver(struct spi_driver *sdrv);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
