Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'kgetopt', this function's name, in a string
#67: FILE: fs/reiserfs/super.c:167:
+	printk ("reiserfs kgetopt: unrecognized option %s\n", ptr1);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#76: FILE: fs/reiserfs/super.c:216:
+    char * pos = options;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
