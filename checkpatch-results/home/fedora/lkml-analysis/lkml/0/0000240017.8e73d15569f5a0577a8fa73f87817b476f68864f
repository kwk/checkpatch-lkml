CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#40: FILE: include/linux/module.h:566:
+extern void __deprecated MODULE_PARM_(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#49: FILE: include/linux/module.h:573:
+#define MODULE_PARM(var,type) static void __attribute_unused__ *__parm_##var = &MODULE_PARM_;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
