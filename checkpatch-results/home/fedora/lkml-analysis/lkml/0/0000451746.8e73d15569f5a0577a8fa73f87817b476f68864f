WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#136: FILE: kernel/futex.c:48:
+extern void send_sigio(struct fown_struct *fown, int fd, int band);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#155: FILE: kernel/futex.c:68:
+extern struct file_operations futex_fops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
