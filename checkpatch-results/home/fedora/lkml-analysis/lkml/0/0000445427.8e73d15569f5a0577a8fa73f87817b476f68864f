           ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#65: FILE: fs/exec.c:55:
+/* The maximal length of core_pattern is also specified in sysctl.c */ $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#88: FILE: fs/exec.c:957:
+	/* Repeat as long as we have more pattern to process and more output
+	   space */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#140: FILE: fs/exec.c:1009:
+				struct timeval tv;
+				do_gettimeofday(&tv);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#227: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:52:
+extern char core_pattern[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
