ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#45: 
--- a/drivers/input/serio/i8042.c	Wed Aug 21 19:00:39 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#59: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:370:
+							if (i8042_last_e0 && (data == 0xaa || data == 0xb6))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#59: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:370:
+							if (i8042_last_e0 && (data == 0xaa || data == 0xb6))

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
