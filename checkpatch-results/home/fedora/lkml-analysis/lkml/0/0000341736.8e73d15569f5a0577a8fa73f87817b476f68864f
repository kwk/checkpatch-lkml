ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#51: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c:270:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+#ifdef CONFIG_HPET_TIMER

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
