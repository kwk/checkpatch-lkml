WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#58: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1029:
+	int (*flush) (struct file *, fl_owner_t id);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#84: FILE: fs/open.c:1140:
+		retval = filp->f_op->flush(filp, id);
 		                           ^^^^
