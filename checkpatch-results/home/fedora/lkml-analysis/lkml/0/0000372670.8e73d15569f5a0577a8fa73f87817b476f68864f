ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#49: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/time.c	Tue May  6 13:25:40 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

+extern spinlock_t xtime_lock;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
