CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*new_bd)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct backlight_device)...)
#154: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/backlight.c:197:
+	new_bd = kzalloc(sizeof(struct backlight_device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
