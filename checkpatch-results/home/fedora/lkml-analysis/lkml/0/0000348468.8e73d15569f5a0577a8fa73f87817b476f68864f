#52: 
- Remove #ifdef CONFIG_VT from console.c, and just check for SUSPEND_CONSOLE.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#66: 
--- a/include/linux/suspend.h	Mon Aug  4 17:44:57 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#73: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:89:
+extern int pm_prepare_console(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
