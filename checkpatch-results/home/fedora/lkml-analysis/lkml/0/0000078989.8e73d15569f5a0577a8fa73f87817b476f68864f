WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#57: FILE: drivers/acpi/sleep/main.c:28:
+extern struct pci_dev *asus_lpc_pcidev;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#78: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:876:
+static int asus_hides_smbus = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#79: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:877:
+struct pci_dev *asus_lpc_pcidev = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#100: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:985:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
