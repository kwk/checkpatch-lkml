#249: FILE: kernel/time/clocksource.c:139:
+		printk("clocksource_register: Cannot register %s. "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'clocksource_register', this function's name, in a string
#249: FILE: kernel/time/clocksource.c:139:
+		printk("clocksource_register: Cannot register %s. "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#265: FILE: kernel/time/clocksource.c:152:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(clocksource_register);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
