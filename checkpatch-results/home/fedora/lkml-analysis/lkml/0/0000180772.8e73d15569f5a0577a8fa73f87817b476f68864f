ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#137: FILE: arch/um/sys-i386/ptrace_user.c:95:
+static int debugregs_seq = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#169: FILE: arch/um/include/kern_util.h:112:
+extern void arch_switch(struct task_struct *from, struct task_struct *to);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
