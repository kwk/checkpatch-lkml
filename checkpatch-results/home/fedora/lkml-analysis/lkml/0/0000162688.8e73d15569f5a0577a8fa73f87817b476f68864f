Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#38: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:266:
+       if(tmp_buffer == NULL) {
+               return -ENOMEM;
+       }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tmp_buffer"
#38: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:266:
+       if(tmp_buffer == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#39: FILE: drivers/acpi/toshiba_acpi.c:267:
+               return -ENOMEM;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
