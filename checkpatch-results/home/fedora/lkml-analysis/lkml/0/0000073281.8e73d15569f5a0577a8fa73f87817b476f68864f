CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#54: FILE: mm/readahead.c:1034:
+static void limit_rala(unsigned long ra_max, unsigned long la_old,
+			unsigned long *ra_size, unsigned long *la_size)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: mm/readahead.c:1129:
+	la_old = la_size = ra->readahead_index - index;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
