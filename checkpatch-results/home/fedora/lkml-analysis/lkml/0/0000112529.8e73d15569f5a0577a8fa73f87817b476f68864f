WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#61: FILE: fs/jffs2/readinode.c:545:
+			JFFS2_ERROR("short read at %#08x: %zu instead of %d.\n", ref_offset(ref), retlen, len);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
