ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#43: FILE: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c:201:
+static int force_tt = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#54: FILE: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c:325:
+		 * can_do_skas() returned 0, and the message is correct. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#55: FILE: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c:326:
+		printf("Support for TT mode is disabled, and no SKAS support is present on the host.\n");

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#86: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process.c:392:
+		else {
+			perror("not found");
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#98: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process.c:403:
+	return(ret);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
