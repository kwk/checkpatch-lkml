#70: 
> SetPageUptodate() which it seems is a macro which lacks some braces somewhere.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#116: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:307:
/* Make it prettier to test the above... */

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#125: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:309:
+#define SetPageUptodate(page)	set_bit(PG_uptodate, &(page)->flags);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
