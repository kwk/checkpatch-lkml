WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead
#105: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:273:
+#define synchronize_sched() synchronize_rcu()

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#115: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:284:
+extern __deprecated_for_modules void synchronize_kernel(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
