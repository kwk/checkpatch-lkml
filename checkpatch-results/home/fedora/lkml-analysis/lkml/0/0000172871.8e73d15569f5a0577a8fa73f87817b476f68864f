ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#77: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pci.c:381:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!hose"
#102: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pci.c:951:
+	if (hose == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+		struct resource *res =  &pci_dev->resource[i];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#177: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/pci.h:139:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
