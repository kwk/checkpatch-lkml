#29: 
I add a kmem_cache_empty funtion and modify kmem_cache_shrink to 
                         ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:57:
+extern int kmem_cache_empty(kmem_cache_t *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'kmem_cache_t *' should also have an identifier name
#81: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:57:
+extern int kmem_cache_empty(kmem_cache_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#104: FILE: mm/slab.c:942:
+	return ret<<(cachep->gfporder);
 	          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#163: FILE: drivers/s390/ccwcache.c:295:
+			if ( kmem_cache_empty(ccw_cache[cachind]) ) {
 				ccw_cache[cachind] = NULL;
 			}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
