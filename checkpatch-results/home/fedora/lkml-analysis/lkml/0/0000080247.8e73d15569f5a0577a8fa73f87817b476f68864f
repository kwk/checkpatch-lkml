Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#1061: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/inode.c:1011:

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#1134: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/inode.c:1084:
+struct inode_operations ecryptfs_symlink_iops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
