#39: 
Removes extra spaces which separate the frequency string from the cpu model id

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

+	   undo that, and also remove multiple spaces from the middle */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#72: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:75:
+	src = dst = &c->x86_model_id[0];

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
