#58: 
Pantelis Antoniou (fs_enet for short) should replace the current FEC driver.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ehternet' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Ethernet'?

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#114: FILE: arch/ppc/8xx_io/enet.c:731:
+	/* Configure port C pins to enable CLSN and RENA.
+	*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
