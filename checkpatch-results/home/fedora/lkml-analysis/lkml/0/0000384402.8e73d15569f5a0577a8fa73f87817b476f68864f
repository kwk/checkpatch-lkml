#64: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:609:
+	/* Validate current setting: the PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE must be

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
