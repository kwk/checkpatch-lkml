ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#102: 
--- a/include/linux/times.h	Tue Apr 13 15:00:25 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#112: FILE: include/linux/times.h:13:
+	u64 tmp = (u64)x * TICK_NSEC;
+	x = do_div(tmp, (NSEC_PER_SEC / USER_HZ));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
