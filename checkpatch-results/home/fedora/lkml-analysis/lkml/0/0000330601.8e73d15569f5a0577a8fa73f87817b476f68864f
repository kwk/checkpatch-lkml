ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#66: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c:495:
+char * SVCFH_fmt(struct svc_fh *fhp)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+	sprintf(buf, "%d: %08x %08x %08x %08x %08x %08x",

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#104: FILE: include/linux/nfsd/nfsfh.h:189:
+extern char * SVCFH_fmt(struct svc_fh *fhp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
