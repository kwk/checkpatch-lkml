during resume by simply overwritting the key.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#75: FILE: kernel/power/Kconfig:80:
+config SWSUSP_ENCRYPT
+	bool "Encrypt suspend image"
+	depends on SOFTWARE_SUSPEND && CRYPTO=y && (CRYPTO_AES=y || CRYPTO_AES_586=y)
+	default ""
+	---help---
+	  To prevent data gathering from swap after resume you can encrypt
+	  the suspend image with a temporary key that is deleted on
+	  resume.
+
+	  Note that the temporary key is stored unencrypted on disk while the
+	  system is suspended.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#94: FILE: kernel/power/main.c:132:
+static char * pm_states[PM_SUSPEND_MAX] = {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#237: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:370:
+	if ((error = crypto_init(1, &tfm)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#258: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:392:
+			error = write_page((unsigned long)&swsusp_header,

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around p->swap_address
#258: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:392:
+					&(p->swap_address));

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#328: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:1381:
+			src.page = dst.page = virt_to_page((void *)p->address);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
