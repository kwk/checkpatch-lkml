#24: 
Make flush_icache() an inline function and clean it up a litte.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#69: FILE: include/asm-m68k/cacheflush.h:17:
+		asm volatile (	"nop\n"

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#73: FILE: include/asm-m68k/cacheflush.h:21:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#75: FILE: include/asm-m68k/cacheflush.h:23:
+		unsigned long tmp;
+		asm volatile (	"movec	%%cacr,%0\n"

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
