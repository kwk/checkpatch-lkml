WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#46: FILE: drivers/acpi/tables/tbxfroot.c:316:
+	if (rsdt_info->pointer) {
+		acpi_os_unmap_memory (rsdt_info->pointer, (acpi_size) rsdt_info->pointer->length);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
