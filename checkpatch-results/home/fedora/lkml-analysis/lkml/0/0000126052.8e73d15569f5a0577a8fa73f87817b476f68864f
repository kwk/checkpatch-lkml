#33: 
as a part of the convergence process between two SPI cores (one is developed by David Brownell and the other one -- by Dmitry Pervushin and me) I'd like to post here one more result of mindwork :). Despite our previous activities of that kind which were more related to porting drivers from one core to the other, this is a port of the library for handling async SPI messages using kernel threads, one per each SPI controller, from our core to David's. 

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'performes' may be misspelled - perhaps 'performed'?
#37: 
This patch performes just minimal intrusion to the SPI core itself, adding a 'void *context' field to the spi_master structure which seems to be a good thing anyway.

#132: FILE: drivers/spi/spi-thread.c:39:
+	int (*xfer) (struct spi_master *, struct spi_message *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
