Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
