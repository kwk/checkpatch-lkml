#25: 
printk clears the host errno (I verified this in debugging and it's reasonable

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#97: FILE: arch/um/drivers/mcast_user.c:99:
+		printk("mcast_open : data bind failed, errno = %d\n", errno);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'mcast_open', this function's name, in a string
#97: FILE: arch/um/drivers/mcast_user.c:99:
+		printk("mcast_open : data bind failed, errno = %d\n", errno);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
