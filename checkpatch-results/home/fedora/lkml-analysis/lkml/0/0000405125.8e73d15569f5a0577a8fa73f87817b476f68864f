WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#66: FILE: qlogicfc.c:1138:
+extern int panic_timeout;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#76: FILE: qlogicfc.c:1234:
+		 * Panic & reboot; we've got nothing to lose. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
