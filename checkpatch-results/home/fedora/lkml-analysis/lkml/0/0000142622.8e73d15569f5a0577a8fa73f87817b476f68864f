WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#36: FILE: drivers/char/rng/ixp4xx-rng.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#37: FILE: drivers/char/rng/ixp4xx-rng.c:2:
+ * drivers/char/rng/ixp4xx-rng.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#58: FILE: drivers/char/rng/ixp4xx-rng.c:23:
+#include <asm/io.h>

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* __iomem bar" should be "foo * __iomem bar"
#63: FILE: drivers/char/rng/ixp4xx-rng.c:28:
+static u32* __iomem rng_base;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#84: FILE: drivers/char/rng/ixp4xx-rng.c:49:
+	rng_base = (u32* __iomem) ioremap(0x70002100, 4);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo* __iomem)" should be "(foo * __iomem)"

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#85: FILE: drivers/char/rng/ixp4xx-rng.c:50:
+	if (!rng_base) return -ENOMEM;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
