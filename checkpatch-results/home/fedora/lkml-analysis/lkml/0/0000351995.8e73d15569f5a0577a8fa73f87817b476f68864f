WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#136: FILE: i2c/i2c-dev.c:269:
+		tmp_pa = (struct i2c_msg *)
+			kmalloc(rdwr_arg.nmsgs * sizeof(struct i2c_msg), 
+			GFP_KERNEL);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#137: FILE: i2c/i2c-dev.c:270:
+^I^I^Ikmalloc(rdwr_arg.nmsgs * sizeof(struct i2c_msg), $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#138: FILE: i2c/i2c-dev.c:271:
+			kmalloc(rdwr_arg.nmsgs * sizeof(struct i2c_msg), 
+			GFP_KERNEL);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#140: FILE: i2c/i2c-dev.c:273:
+		if (tmp_pa == NULL)
+		{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tmp_pa"
#140: FILE: i2c/i2c-dev.c:273:
+		if (tmp_pa == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#151: FILE: i2c/i2c-dev.c:283:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
