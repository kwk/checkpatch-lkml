WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#49: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/asm-offsets.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/processor.h> instead of <asm/processor.h>
#67: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/asm-offsets.c:19:
+#include <asm/processor.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'member' may be better as '(member)' to avoid precedence issues
#70: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/asm-offsets.c:22:

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#132: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/asm-offsets.c:84:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
