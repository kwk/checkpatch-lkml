# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as

infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#57: 
--- a/Makefile	Thu Oct 10 21:50:03 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
