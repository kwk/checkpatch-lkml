WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#41: FILE: fs/isofs/dir.c:97:
+static struct buffer_head *isofs_bread(struct inode *inode, unsigned int bufsize, unsigned int block)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#44: FILE: fs/isofs/dir.c:100:
+	unsigned int blknr = isofs_bmap(inode, block);
+	if (!blknr)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#103: FILE: fs/isofs/dir.c:141:
+		if (first_de) inode_number = (block << bufbits) + (offset & (bufsize - 1));

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#110: FILE: fs/isofs/dir.c:146:
+#endif^I    $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
