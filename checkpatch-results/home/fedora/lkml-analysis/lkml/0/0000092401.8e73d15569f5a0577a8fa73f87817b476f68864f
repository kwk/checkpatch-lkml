Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#177: FILE: Makefile:1336:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
