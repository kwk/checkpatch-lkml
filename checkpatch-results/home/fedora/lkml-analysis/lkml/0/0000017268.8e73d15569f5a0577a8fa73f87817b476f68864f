CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#61: FILE: drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_init.c:158:
+		struct Scsi_Host *shost = dev_to_shost(phy->dev.parent);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#75: FILE: drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_init.c:172:
+		struct domain_device *ddev = sas_find_dev_by_rphy(rphy);
+		ret = sas_smp_phy_control(ddev, phy->number, command, NULL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0200'.
#152: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_sas.c:371:
+static CLASS_DEVICE_ATTR(enable, S_IWUSR, NULL, store_sas_phy_enable);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct sas_phy *' should also have an identifier name
#187: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_transport_sas.h:166:
+	int (*phy_enable)(struct sas_phy *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#187: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_transport_sas.h:166:
+	int (*phy_enable)(struct sas_phy *, int);
