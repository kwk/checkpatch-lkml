Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct radix_tree_root *' should also have an identifier name
#101: FILE: include/linux/radix-tree.h:69:
+void *radix_tree_lookup_parent(struct radix_tree_root *, unsigned long,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
