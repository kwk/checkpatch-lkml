WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#27: 
# HG changeset patch

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#65: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-dma.c:37:
+int iommu_detected __read_mostly = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#76: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-gart.c:630:
+        /* Did we detect a different HW IOMMU? */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#79: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-gart.c:633:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
