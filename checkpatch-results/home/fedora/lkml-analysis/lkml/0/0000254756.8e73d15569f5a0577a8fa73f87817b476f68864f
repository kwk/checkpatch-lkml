The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

+config IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS
+	tristate "TCPMSS target support"
+	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES
+	---help---
+	  This option adds a `TCPMSS' target, which allows you to alter the
+	  MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control the maximum size for that
+	  connection (usually limiting it to your outgoing interface's MTU
+	  minus 40).
+
+	  This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
+	  block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this
+	  problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
+	  firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
+	  packets:
+	  	1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
+	  	2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
+	  	3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.
+
+	  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
+	  configuration like:
+
+	  iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \
+	  		 -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu
+
+	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
