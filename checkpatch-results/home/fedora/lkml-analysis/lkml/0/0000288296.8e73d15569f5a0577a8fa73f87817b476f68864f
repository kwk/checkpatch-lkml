+config ALPHA_LEGACY_START_ADDRESS

+	---help---
+	  The 2.4 kernel changed the kernel start address from 0x310000
+	  to 0x810000 to make room for the Wildfire's larger SRM console.
+	  Recent consoles on Titan and Marvel machines also require the
+	  extra room.
+
+	  If you're using aboot 0.7 or later, the bootloader will examine the
+	  ELF headers to determine where to transfer control. Unfortunately,
+	  most older bootloaders -- APB or MILO -- hardcoded the kernel start
+	  address rather than examining the ELF headers, and the result is a
+	  hard lockup.
+
+	  Say Y if you have a broken bootloader.  Say N if you do not, or if
+	  you wish to run on Wildfire, Titan, or Marvel.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
