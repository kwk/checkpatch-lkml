The direct I/O code is mapping the read request to the file system block.  If

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'the'
#25: 
the file size was not on a block boundary, the result would show the the read

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dio->rw == READ'

+			if ((dio->rw == READ) &&
+			    ((offset + transferred) > dio->i_size))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
