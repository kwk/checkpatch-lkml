#24: 
During ia64 kernel initialization, the physical address of the ACPI tables is passed via the EFI Configuration Table.  In efi_init() the address is stored as a virtual address in the kernel's efi structure.  Later when ACPI is initialized, these are converted back to physical addresses in acpi_find_rsdp() and acpi_os_get_root_pointer().
