CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#74: FILE: include/linux/security.h:171:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#88: FILE: include/linux/security.h:357:
+ * ^I^I^I(e.g. selinux).$

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#116: FILE: include/linux/security.h:1516:
+	return security_ops->inode_init_security (inode, dir, head);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*datap)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct xattr_data)...)
#209: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:2008:
+	datap = kmalloc(sizeof(struct xattr_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
