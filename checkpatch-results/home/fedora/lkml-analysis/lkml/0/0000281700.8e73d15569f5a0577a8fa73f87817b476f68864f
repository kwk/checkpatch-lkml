ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#45: 
--- a/drivers/media/video/saa7111.c	Fri May 14 16:19:12 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
#98: FILE: drivers/media/video/saa7111.c:217:
+		if (NULL != init)

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_ELSE: else is not generally useful after a break or return
#100: FILE: drivers/media/video/saa7111.c:219:
+			return saa7111_init_decoder(client, init);
+		else {

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#100: FILE: drivers/media/video/saa7111.c:219:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
