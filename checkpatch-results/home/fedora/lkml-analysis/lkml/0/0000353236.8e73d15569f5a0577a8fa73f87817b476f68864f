#29: 
Hi Linus - please apply. Only docbook relevant changes [with patch this time].

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#63: 
--- a/CREDITS	Fri Jul 18 23:21:44 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
