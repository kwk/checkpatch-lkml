ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#49: FILE: arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c:125:
+void * xquad_portio = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#49: FILE: arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c:125:
+void * xquad_portio = NULL;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
