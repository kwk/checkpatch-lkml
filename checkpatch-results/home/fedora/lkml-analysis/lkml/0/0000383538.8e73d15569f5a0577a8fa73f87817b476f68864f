ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#68: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:459:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#308: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:629:
+	if (req->reply[0] & 0x04) {
[...]
+				vb += ((current - 200) * 15)/100;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#338: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:638:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#365: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:660:
+		charge = max = current = voltage = time = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#395: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:752:
+		pmu_request(&batt_req, done_battery_state_ohare,
+			1, PMU_BATTERY_STATE);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#654: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:1865:

+static void __pmac

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <powerbook_sleep_Core99>

#772: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:2502:
+pmu_ioctl(struct inode * inode, struct file *filp,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#781: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:2576:
+static struct file_operations pmu_device_fops __pmacdata = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
