WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#68: FILE: arch/h8300/Kconfig:173:
+source "arch/h8300/Kconfig.ide"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#95: FILE: arch/h8300/Kconfig:239:
+config SERIAL
+	tristate "Serial (8250, 16450, 16550 or compatible) support"
+	---help---
+	  This selects whether you want to include the driver for the standard
+	  serial ports.  The standard answer is Y.  People who might say N
+	  here are those that are setting up dedicated Ethernet WWW/FTP
+	  servers, or users that have one of the various bus mice instead of a
+	  serial mouse and don't intend to use their machine's standard serial
+	  port for anything.  (Note that the Cyclades and Stallion multi
+	  serial port drivers do not need this driver built in for them to
+	  work.)
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called serial.
+	  [WARNING: Do not compile this driver as a module if you are using
+	  non-standard serial ports, since the configuration information will
+	  be lost when the driver is unloaded.  This limitation may be lifted
+	  in the future.]
+
+	  BTW1: If you have a mouseman serial mouse which is not recognized by
+	  the X window system, try running gpm first.
+
+	  BTW2: If you intend to use a software modem (also called Winmodem)
+	  under Linux, forget it.  These modems are crippled and require
+	  proprietary drivers which are only available under Windows.
+
+	  Most people will say Y or M here, so that they can use serial mice,
+	  modems and similar devices connecting to the standard serial ports.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
