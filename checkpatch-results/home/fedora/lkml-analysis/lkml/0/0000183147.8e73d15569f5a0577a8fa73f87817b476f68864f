#25: 
The following patch fixes a problem in our passthru ioctls. I added a memset to

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#45: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:980:
+^I^Ielse $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#45: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:980:
 		}
+		else 

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
