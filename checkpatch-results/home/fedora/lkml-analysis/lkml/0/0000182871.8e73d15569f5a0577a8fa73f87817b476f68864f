         ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#54: 
--- a/drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_spi.c

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
