ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#40: 
--- a/drivers/input/serio/serio.c	Tue Sep 30 01:22:43 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#61: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serio.c:113:
 		switch (event->type) {
+			case SERIO_RECONNECT :

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited before that ':' (ctx:WxE)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#66: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serio.c:118:
+				/* reconnect failed - fall through to rescan */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#67: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serio.c:119:
+^I^I^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#82: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serio.c:158:
+	if ((event = kmalloc(sizeof(struct serio_event), GFP_ATOMIC))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*event)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct serio_event)...)
#82: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serio.c:158:
+	if ((event = kmalloc(sizeof(struct serio_event), GFP_ATOMIC))) {

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct serio *' should also have an identifier name
#113: FILE: include/linux/serio.h:56:
+	int  (*reconnect)(struct serio *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
