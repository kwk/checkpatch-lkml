Subject: [PATCH 1/3] kbuild: rename prepare to archprepare to fix dependency chain

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#131: FILE: Makefile:785:
+# archprepare is used in arch Makefiles and when processed asm symlink,

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
