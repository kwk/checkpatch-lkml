BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.

error condition as gracefully as possible.

the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.

  char *linux_banner;

  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#310: FILE: fs/ntfs/aops.c:1894:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
