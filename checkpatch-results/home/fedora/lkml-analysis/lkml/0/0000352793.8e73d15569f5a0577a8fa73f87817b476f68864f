Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#145: FILE: arch/um/kernel/process_kern.c:112:
+	return (pid);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

#183: FILE: arch/um/kernel/syscall_kern.c:41:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
