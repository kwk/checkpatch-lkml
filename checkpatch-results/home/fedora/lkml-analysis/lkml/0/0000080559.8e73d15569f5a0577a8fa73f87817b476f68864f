#37: 
    Fix/remove bad/unused timing tables: HPT370/A 66 MHz tables weren't really

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#268: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c:1151:
+			if (info->revision >= 5) {
[...]
-				info->speed = sixty_six_base_hpt370a;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
