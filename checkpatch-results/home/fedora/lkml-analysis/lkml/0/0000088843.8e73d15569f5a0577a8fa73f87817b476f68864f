WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#82: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#87: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/pca954x.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

+/* Chip type must normally be specified using a parameter of the form

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"

+			struct i2c_client *client, int read_write, u8 * val)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*data)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pca954x_data)...)
#277: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/pca954x.c:191:
+	if (!(data = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pca954x_data), GFP_KERNEL))) {

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

The ARRAY_SIZE(foo) macro should be preferred over
sizeof(foo)/sizeof(foo[0]) for finding number of elements in an
array.

The macro is defined in include/linux/kernel.h::

  #define ARRAY_SIZE(x) (sizeof(x) / sizeof((x)[0]))
