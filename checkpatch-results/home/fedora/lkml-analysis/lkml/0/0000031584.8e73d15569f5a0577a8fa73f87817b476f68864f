ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#79: 
--- a/fs/namei.c	2006-08-29 14:15:47.000000000 +0400

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IXUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0111'.
#90: FILE: fs/namei.c:255:
+	if ((mask & MAY_EXEC) && S_ISREG(mode) && (!(mode & S_IXUGO) ||

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
