The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

+	hpsb_set_packet_complete_task(packet, (void (*)(void*))sbp2_free_packet,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
