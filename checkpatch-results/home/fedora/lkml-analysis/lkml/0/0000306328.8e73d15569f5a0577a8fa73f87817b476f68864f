This patch is the 2.4 version of the 2.6 patch I've just send, which corrects

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#70: FILE: drivers/media/video/meye.c:197:
+ * disabled for HIGHMEM64G=y, where sizeof(dma_addr_t) != 4 */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
