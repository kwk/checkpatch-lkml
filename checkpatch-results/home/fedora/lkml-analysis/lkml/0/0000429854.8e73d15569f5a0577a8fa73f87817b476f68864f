One nice side effect of this patch, is that all iterfaces for a USB

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#48: 
--- a/drivers/base/Makefile	Wed Sep 25 14:22:28 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: drivers/base/base.h:55:
+extern int dev_hotplug(struct device *dev, const char *action);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
