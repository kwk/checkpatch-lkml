If vmscan finds a zero refcount page on the lru list, never ClearPageLRU it.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#64: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:842:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
