WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#61: 
#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#192: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:73:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
