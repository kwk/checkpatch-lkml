WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#63: FILE: drivers/net/Kconfig:1397:
+config E100_EEH_RECOVERY
+	bool "Enable PCI bus error recovery"

+   help
+      If you say Y here, the driver will be able to recover from
+      PCI bus errors on many PowerPC platforms. IBM pSeries users
+      should answer Y.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#100: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:2671:
+ *  Restart the card from scratch. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

#113: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:2684:

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.
