ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#24: 
--- a/init/Kconfig	2002-12-16 07:02:05.000000000 +0100

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#58: FILE: net/Kconfig:7:
+config NET
+	bool "Networking support"
+	---help---
+	  Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here.
+	  The reason is that some programs need kernel networking support even
+	  when running on a stand-alone machine that isn't connected to any
+	  other computer. If you are upgrading from an older kernel, you
+	  should consider updating your networking tools too because changes
+	  in the kernel and the tools often go hand in hand. The tools are
+	  contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number
+	  of which are given in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
+
+	  For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly
+	  recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from
+	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.
+
 menu "Networking options"
 	depends on NET
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#81: FILE: net/Kconfig:673:
+source "drivers/net/Kconfig"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
