WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'ammount' may be misspelled - perhaps 'amount'?
#72: 
for long ammount of time, nor how is third parameter related...
         ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

+		/* Actually, other values are possible, too. Everything between 80..194
+		   seems to work as duty parameter */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
