It should be possible for the administrator to specify at boot-time how much

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#58: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:126:
+static unsigned int easyrclm_pages = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#70: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:931:
+^I          * for features like memory remove or huge page allocations$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#72: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:933:
+		else if (!memcmp(from, "kernelcore=",11)) {
+			core_mem_pages = memparse(from + 11, &from) >> PAGE_SHIFT;

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
