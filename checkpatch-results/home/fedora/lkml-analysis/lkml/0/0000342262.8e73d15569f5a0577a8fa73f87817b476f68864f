WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#159: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:609:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "serio: %s port at %s\n", psmouse->ptport->serio.name, psmouse->phys);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#190: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:640:
+	psmouse->type = psmouse->acking = psmouse->cmdcnt = psmouse->pktcnt = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 15)
#191: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:641:
+	if (psmouse->reconnect) {

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#191: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:641:
+	if (psmouse->reconnect) {
[...]
+	} else if (psmouse_probe(psmouse) != old_type)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

#333: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:293:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
