WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#44: FILE: fault.c:262:
+       if (in_atomic() || irqs_disabled() || !mm)

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
