#29: 
Can this patch to drivers/pci/quirks.c be incorporated into the kernel? It fixes a bug in some BIOSes that hide the M7101 PMU and SMBUS device and is needed for some boards to use the i2c-ali15x3 driver. lm_sensors includes a module that makes that device visible. i got this patch from the kernel mailing list and adapted it to the kernel coding style.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
