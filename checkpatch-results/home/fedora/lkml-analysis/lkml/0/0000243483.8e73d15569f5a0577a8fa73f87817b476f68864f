#23: 
Currently hostfs passes the rdev value from stat() on the host as rdev value

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#44: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs.h:41:
+extern int file_type(const char *path, int *maj, int *min);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open brace '{'
#64: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs_kern.c:234:
+	if(file_type(name, NULL, NULL) == OS_TYPE_SYMLINK){

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Reencode' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Re-encode'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#105: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs_user.c:64:
+	 *about its definition.*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "maj"
#106: FILE: fs/hostfs/hostfs_user.c:65:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
