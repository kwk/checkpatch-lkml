> Looks good.  I think you want to disable it unconditionally for !CONFIG_MMU.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#47: FILE: include/linux/futex.h:11:
+long do_futex(unsigned long, int, int, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+       depends on MMU
+       default y

+       Say Y if you want support for Fast Userspace Mutexes (Futexes).

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
