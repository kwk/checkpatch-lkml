#61: FILE: drivers/char/lp.c:693:
+static int __init console_lp_strict_setup (char *str)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#63: FILE: drivers/char/lp.c:695:
+	console_lp_strict = simple_strtol(str, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.
