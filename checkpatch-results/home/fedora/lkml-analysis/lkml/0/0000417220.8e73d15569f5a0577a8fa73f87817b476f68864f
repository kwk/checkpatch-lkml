I update patchset agaist 2.5.45 and do some cleanups.
                  ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#117: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:1740:
+	p += sprintf(p, "%s " BIOS_VERSION_HILO_FMT +		     " 0x%02x 0x%02x 0x%02x 0x%02x %d%% %d %s\n",

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Deamonize' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Daemonize'?

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#140: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:1805:
+			else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
