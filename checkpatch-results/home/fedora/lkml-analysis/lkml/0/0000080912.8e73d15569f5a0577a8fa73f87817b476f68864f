WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#68: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu-event.c:1:
+#include <linux/input.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#132: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu-event.h:1:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#137: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu-event.h:6:
+extern void pmu_event(int key, int down);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#177: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:1447:
+		 * know what PMU versions send what events here? */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
