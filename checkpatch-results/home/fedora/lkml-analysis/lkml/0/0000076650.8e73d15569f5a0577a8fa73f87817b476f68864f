WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'impement' may be misspelled - perhaps 'implement'?
#56: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:777:
+ * The following three functions are to impement per_cpu variables
                                         ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#64: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:785:
+	return (pud_t*)pgd;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#79: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:800:
+	if (pmd_none(*pmd)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
