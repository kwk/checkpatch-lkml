#27: 
Next patch provides a CPU_THRESHOLD; makes sense since we also have a NODE_THRESHOLD as tuning knob.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#38: 
--- a/kernel/sched.c	Fri Aug 22 14:20:23 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
