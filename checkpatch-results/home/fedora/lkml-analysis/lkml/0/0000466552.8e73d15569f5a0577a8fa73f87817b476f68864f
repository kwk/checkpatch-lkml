ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#54: 
--- a/fs/reiserfs/inode.c	Tue Apr  2 14:44:38 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

+/* reiserfs_read_inode2 is called to read the inode off disk, and it
+** does a make_bad_inode when things go wrong.  But, we need to make sure

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
