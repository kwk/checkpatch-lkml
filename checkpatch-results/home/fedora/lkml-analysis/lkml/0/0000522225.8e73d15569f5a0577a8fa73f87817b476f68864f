The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#87: FILE: drivers/pnp/pnp_bios.c:634:
+static void inline pnpbios_add_irqresource(struct pci_dev *dev, int irq)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
