WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#209: FILE: init/Kconfig:106:
+config SWAP_PREFETCH
+	bool "Support for prefetching swapped memory"
+	depends on SWAP
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  This option will allow the kernel to prefetch swapped memory pages
+	  when idle. The pages will be kept on both swap and in swap_cache
+	  thus avoiding the need for further I/O if either ram or swap space
+	  is required.
+
+	  What this will do on workstations is slowly bring back applications
+	  that have swapped out after memory intensive workloads back into
+	  physical ram if you have free ram at a later stage and the machine
+	  is relatively idle. This means that when you come back to your
+	  computer after leaving it idle for a while, applications will come
+	  to life faster. Note that your swap usage will appear to increase
+	  but these are cached pages, can be dropped freely by the vm, and it
+	  should stabilise around 50% swap usage maximum.
+
+	  Workstations and multiuser workstation servers will most likely want
+	  to say Y.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
