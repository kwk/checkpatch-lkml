CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#83: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:114:
+		ret = clear_user((void __user *) elf_bss, nbyte);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#85: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:116:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#171: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:776:

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'interpreter_type == INTERPRETER_AOUT'
#206: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:901:
+	if ((retval = create_elf_tables(bprm, &loc->elf_ex, (interpreter_type == INTERPRETER_AOUT),

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#206: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:901:
+	if ((retval = create_elf_tables(bprm, &loc->elf_ex, (interpreter_type == INTERPRETER_AOUT),

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
