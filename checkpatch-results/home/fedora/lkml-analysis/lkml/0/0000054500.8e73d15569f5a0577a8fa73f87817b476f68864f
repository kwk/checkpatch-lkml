WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#117: FILE: fs/smbfs/ioctl.c:77:
+	int result;
+	lock_kernel();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#118: FILE: fs/smbfs/ioctl.c:78:
+	arg = (unsigned long) compat_ptr(arg);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#167: FILE: fs/smbfs/proto.h:71:
+extern long smb_compat_ioctl(struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);
                                           ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#167: FILE: fs/smbfs/proto.h:71:
+extern long smb_compat_ioctl(struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
