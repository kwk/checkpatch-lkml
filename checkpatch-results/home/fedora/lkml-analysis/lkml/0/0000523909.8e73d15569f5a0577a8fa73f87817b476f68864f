David, thanks for pointing this out. Ofcourse, it has be reset at that point.

                           ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#86: FILE: kernel/sched.c:100:
+		struct task_struct * resched;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#91: FILE: kernel/sched.c:104:
+} aligned_data [NR_CPUS] __cacheline_aligned = { {{&init_task,0,0}}};

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cpu_resched"
#113: FILE: kernel/sched.c:225:
+		    (cpu_resched(best_cpu) == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
