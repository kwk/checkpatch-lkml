CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dd"
#137: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_diag.c:256:
+	if (dd == NULL || !(dd->ipath_flags & IPATH_PRESENT) ||

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ipath_devdata *' should also have an identifier name
#349: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_kernel.h:543:
+void ipath_layer_remove(struct ipath_devdata *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
