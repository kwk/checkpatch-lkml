CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#47: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:106:
+#define TAINT_UNKNOWN_STATE		(1<<4)
                            		  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#47: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:106:
+#define TAINT_UNKNOWN_STATE		(1<<4)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#64: FILE: kernel/panic.c:118:
