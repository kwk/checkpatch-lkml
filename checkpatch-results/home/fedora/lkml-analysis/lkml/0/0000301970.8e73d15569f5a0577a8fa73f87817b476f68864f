CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#111: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:704:
+		charge = max = amperage = voltage = time = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#150: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:766:
+		capa = max = amperage = voltage = 0;

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'amperage > 0'
#153: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:768:
+	if ((req->reply[1] & 0x01) && (amperage > 0))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#164: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:776:
+	if (amperage) {
[...]
-				= (capa * 3600) / (-current);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'amperage > 0'
#165: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:777:
+		if ((req->reply[1] & 0x01) && (amperage > 0))

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#168: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:779:
 			pmu_batteries[pmu_cur_battery].time_remaining
+				= ((max-capa) * 3600) / amperage;

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
