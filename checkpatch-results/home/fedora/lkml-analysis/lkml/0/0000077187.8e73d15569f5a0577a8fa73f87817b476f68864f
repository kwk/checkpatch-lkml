WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'configration' may be misspelled - perhaps 'configuration'?
#61: 
I didn't imagine above (strange) configration.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#62: 
So, simple range check will not work for all configration anyway.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#112: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:319:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#168: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2454:
+		if (zone_boundary_align_pfn(zone_start_pfn) != zone_start_pfn) {
+			unaligned_zone = 1;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
