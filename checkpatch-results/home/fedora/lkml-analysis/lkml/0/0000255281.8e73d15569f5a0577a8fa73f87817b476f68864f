CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#46: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/ptrace.h:87:
+extern unsigned long profile_pc(struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'spinlock_t *' should also have an identifier name
#92: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/spinlock.h:45:
+void fastcall __spin_lock_loop(spinlock_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'spinlock_t *' should also have an identifier name
#93: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/spinlock.h:46:
+void fastcall __spin_lock_loop_flags(spinlock_t *, unsigned long);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
