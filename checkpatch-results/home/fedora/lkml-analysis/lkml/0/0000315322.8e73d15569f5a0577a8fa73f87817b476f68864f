#54: 
The global mutex, the global spinlock and the global "struct kt_message" go away. 

CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment

+	spinlock_t lock;

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
