Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

+static inline int mapping_gfp_mask(struct address_space * mapping)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
