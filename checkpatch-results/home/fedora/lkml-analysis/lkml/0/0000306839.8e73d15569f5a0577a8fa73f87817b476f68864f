WARNING:IF_0: Consider removing the code enclosed by this #if 0 and its #endif
#101: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/pdc202xx_new.c:143:
+#if 0

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#132: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/pdc202xx_new.c:595:
+	hwif->drives[0].autotune = hwif->drives[1].autotune = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
