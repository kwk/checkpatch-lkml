CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#128: FILE: include/asm-i386/apic.h:82:
+extern void disable_APIC_timer(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#226: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1314:
+	idle_rq->curr = idle_rq->idle = idle;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
