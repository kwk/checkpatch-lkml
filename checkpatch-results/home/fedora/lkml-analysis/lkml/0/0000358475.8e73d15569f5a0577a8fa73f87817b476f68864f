WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#95: FILE: kernel/sched.c:304:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#98: FILE: kernel/sched.c:307:
+	if (old_avg_time < new_avg_time) return;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
