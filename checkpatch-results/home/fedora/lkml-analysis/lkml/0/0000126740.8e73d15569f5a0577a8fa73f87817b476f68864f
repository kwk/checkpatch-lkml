CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*hotplug_slot->info)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct hotplug_slot_info)...)
#77: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/acpiphp_core.c:368:
+		hotplug_slot->info = kmalloc(sizeof(struct hotplug_slot_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
