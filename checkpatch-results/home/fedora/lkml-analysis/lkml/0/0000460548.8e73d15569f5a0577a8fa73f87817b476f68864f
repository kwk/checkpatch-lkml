#22: 
Hi, the below patch adds a new exported functon init_address_space() and 
                                        ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#48: 
--- a/fs/inode.c	Sun May  5 03:10:53 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct address_space_operations should normally be const
#67: FILE: fs/inode.c:86:
+static struct address_space_operations empty_aops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#156: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1237:
+extern void init_address_space(struct address_space *mapping,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
