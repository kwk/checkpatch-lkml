WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'spinlock_t' should also have an identifier name
#49: FILE: include/linux/spinlock_api_smp.h:35:
+unsigned long __lockfunc _spin_lock_irqsave_nested(spinlock_t *lock, int subclass)

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#73: FILE: include/linux/spinlock.h:190:
+#define spin_lock_irqsave_nested(lock, flags, subclass)	flags = _spin_lock_irqsave_nested(lock, subclass)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
