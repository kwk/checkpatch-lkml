CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#97: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:900:
+extern int idle_balance_retry(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#130: FILE: arch/i386/Kconfig:446:
+config NO_IDLE_HZ
+        bool "Tickless Idle CPUs support"
+        default n
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#147: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:100:
+#define MAX_SLEEP_DURATION ^I128^I/* in tick counts */$

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#165: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:117:
+			if (jif_delta > MIN_SLEEP_DURATION) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#181: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:133:
+				while ((jiffies < jif_next-1) &&
 				                          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:JIFFIES_COMPARISON: Comparing jiffies is almost always wrong; prefer time_after, time_before and friends
#181: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:133:
+				while ((jiffies < jif_next-1) &&

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#182: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:134:
+				while ((jiffies < jif_next-1) &&
+					 __get_cpu_var(idle_asleep))

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#186: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:138:
