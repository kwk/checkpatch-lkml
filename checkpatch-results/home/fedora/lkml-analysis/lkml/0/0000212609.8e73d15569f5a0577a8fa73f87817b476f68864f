#206: FILE: lib/qsort.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#248: FILE: lib/qsort.c:43:
+	stack = top = kmalloc(8 * sizeof(int) * sizeof(struct stack), flags);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#260: FILE: lib/qsort.c:55:
+			for(i = l + size, p = l; i != r; i += size)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
