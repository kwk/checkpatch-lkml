CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/skbuff.h:587:
+extern void skb_queue_head_init(struct sk_buff_head *list);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#75: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:77:
+	list->prev = list->next = (struct sk_buff *)list;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#79: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:81:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(skb_queue_head_init);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
