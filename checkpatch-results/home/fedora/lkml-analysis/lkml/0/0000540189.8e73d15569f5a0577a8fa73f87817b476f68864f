ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#54: FILE: starfire.c:381:
+	static int done = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#56: FILE: starfire.c:383:
+	if (done) return -ENODEV;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
