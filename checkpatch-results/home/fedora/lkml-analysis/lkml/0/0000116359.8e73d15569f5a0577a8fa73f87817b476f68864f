WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 120 exceeds 100 columns
#95: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/speedtch.c:758:
+	usb_dbg(usbatm, "%s: firmware %s loaded\n", __func__, usbatm->flags & UDSL_SKIP_HEAVY_INIT ? "already" : "not");

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (8, 24)
#140: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usbatm.c:1016:
+	if (driver->bind && (error = driver->bind(instance, intf, id)) < 0) {
 			dev_err(dev, "%s: bind failed: %d!\n", __func__, error);

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#140: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usbatm.c:1016:
+	if (driver->bind && (error = driver->bind(instance, intf, id)) < 0) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#162: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usbatm.h:89:
+#define UDSL_SKIP_HEAVY_INIT	(1<<0)
                             	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#162: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usbatm.h:89:
+#define UDSL_SKIP_HEAVY_INIT	(1<<0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#164: FILE: drivers/usb/atm/usbatm.h:91:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
