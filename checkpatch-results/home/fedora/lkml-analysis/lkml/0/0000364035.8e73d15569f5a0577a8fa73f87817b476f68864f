WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#80: FILE: ia64/hp/common/sba_iommu.c:1892:
+	printk(KERN_WARNING "No IOC for PCI Bus %04x:%02x in ACPI\n", pci_domain_nr(bus), bus->number);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
