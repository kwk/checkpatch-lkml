WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#71: FILE: drivers/net/3c59x.c:2491:
+			if (pkt_len < rx_copybreak && (skb = netdev_alloc_skb(dev, pkt_len + 2)) != 0) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
