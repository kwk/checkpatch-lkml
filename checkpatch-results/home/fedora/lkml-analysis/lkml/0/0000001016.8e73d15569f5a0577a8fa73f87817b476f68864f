ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#85: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1023:
+static int futex_wait(u32 __user *uaddr, u32 val, struct timespec *time)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#105: FILE: kernel/futex.c:1111:
+		if (time->tv_sec == 0 && time->tv_nsec == 0)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!t.task"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
