Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!nfsd_serv"
#58: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:212:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
