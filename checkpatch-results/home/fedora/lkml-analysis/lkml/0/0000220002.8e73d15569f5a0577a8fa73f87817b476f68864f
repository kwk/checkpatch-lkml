CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: include/asm-i386/ptrace.h:58:
+extern void send_sigtrap(struct task_struct *tsk, struct pt_regs *regs, int error_code);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#186: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c:48:
+	void *stack_top = (void *)task->thread.esp0;
+	return stack_top - sizeof(struct pt_regs);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
