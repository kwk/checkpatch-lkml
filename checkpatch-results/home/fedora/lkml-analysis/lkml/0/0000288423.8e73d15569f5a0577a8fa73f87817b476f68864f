#116: 
Hi Len, I have updated my nforce2 patches for 2.6.5 to work with your patch.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'thats' may be misspelled - perhaps 'that's'?
#119: 
Hopefully no clock skew. I saw none on my system but thats no guarantee.
                                                     ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#145: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:2184:
+		extern int acpi_skip_timer_override;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#146: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:2185:
+		extern int acpi_skip_timer_override;
+		if(acpi_skip_timer_override)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#146: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:2185:
+		if(acpi_skip_timer_override)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#191: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/process.c:115:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
