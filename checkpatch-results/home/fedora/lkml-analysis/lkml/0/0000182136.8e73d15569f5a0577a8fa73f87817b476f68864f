WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#39: FILE: include/linux/ima_module.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#47: FILE: include/linux/ima_module.h:9:
+ * LSM IBM Integrity Measurement Architecture.^I^I  $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/ima_module.h:22:
+extern void measure_kernel_module(void *start, unsigned long len, void *uargs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
