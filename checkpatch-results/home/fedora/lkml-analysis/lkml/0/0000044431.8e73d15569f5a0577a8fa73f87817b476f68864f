CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u32' over 'uint32_t'
#89: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs4xdr.c:3358:
+	uint32_t	len, attrlen, xlen;

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#147: FILE: net/sunrpc/clnt.c:1238:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'call_verify', this function's name, in a string
#148: FILE: net/sunrpc/clnt.c:1239:
+		       "call_verify: XDR representation not a multiple of"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#149: FILE: net/sunrpc/clnt.c:1240:
+		       "call_verify: XDR representation not a multiple of"
+		       " 4 bytes: 0x%x\n", task->tk_rqstp->rq_rcv_buf.len);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
