CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#103: FILE: include/asm-ia64/pgtable.h:433:
+extern void update_mmu_cache (struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long vaddr, pte_t pte);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+ptep_cmpxchg (struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long addr, pte_t *ptep, pte_t oldval, pte_t newval)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
