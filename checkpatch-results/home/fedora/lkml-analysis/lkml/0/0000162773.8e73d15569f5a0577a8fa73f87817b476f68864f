#26: 
This patch changes the /proc/sysvipc/shm|sem|msg files to use the generic seq_file implementation for struct ipc_ids.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#154: FILE: ipc/shm.c:892:
+			  is_file_hugepages(shp->shm_file) ? (file_count(shp->shm_file) - 1) : shp->shm_nattch,

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
