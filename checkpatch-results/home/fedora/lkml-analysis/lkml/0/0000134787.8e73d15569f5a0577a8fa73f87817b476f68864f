Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'krxtimod', this function's name, in a string
#268: FILE: net/rxrpc/krxtimod.c:71:
+	printk("Started krxtimod %d\n", task_pid(current));

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#312: FILE: net/unix/af_unix.c:1108:
+	ska->sk_peercred.pid = skb->sk_peercred.pid = task_tgid(current);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
