#28: 
I recently posted a patch for the coprocessor device in the 2.4.0 sound drivers. Well, it appears that I missed the synth device in the mpu401.c file and so here is an updated version.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
