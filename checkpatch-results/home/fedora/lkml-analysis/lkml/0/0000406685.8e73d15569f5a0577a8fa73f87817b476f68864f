ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#84: 
--- a/drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c	Mon Dec 16 11:33:37 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#116: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:297:
+	if (~via_config->flags & VIA_NO_CMD_AS) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#118: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:299:
+		t = (t & ~(3 << ((3 - dn) << 1))) | ((FIT(timing->setup, 1, 4) - 1) << ((3 - dn) << 1));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
