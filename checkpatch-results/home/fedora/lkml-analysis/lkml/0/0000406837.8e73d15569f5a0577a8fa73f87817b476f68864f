WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#53: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:679:
+		extern int pc98;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#87: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:758:
+				unsigned long end = max_low_pfn * PAGE_SIZE;
+				if (mpf->mpf_physptr + size > end)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#118: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c:807:

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 161 exceeds 100 columns

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
