	This genericized interface makes futexes useable for pthreads.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line

+			if (num_woken >= num) break;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#176: FILE: kernel/futex.c:160:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#216: FILE: kernel/futex.c:193:
+		struct timespec t;
+		if (copy_from_user(&t, utime, sizeof(t)) != 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
