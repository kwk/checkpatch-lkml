CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#113: FILE: include/linux/wait.h:80:
+extern void init_waitqueue_head(wait_queue_head_t *q);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#133: FILE: kernel/wait.c:19:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(init_waitqueue_head);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
