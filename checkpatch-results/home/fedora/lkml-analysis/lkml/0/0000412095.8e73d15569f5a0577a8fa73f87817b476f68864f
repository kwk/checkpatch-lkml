I finally have LiS running on a 2.5 kernel.  Attached is the 2.5.46 version

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#72: FILE: sys.c:198:
+static int (*do_putpmsg) (int, void *, void *, int, int) = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#80: FILE: sys.c:206:
+       int ret = -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
