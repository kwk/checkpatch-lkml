Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'nfsd4_lock', this function's name, in a string
#52: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:2818:
+		dprintk("NFSD: nfsd4_lock: posix_lock_file() failed! status %d\n",status);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
