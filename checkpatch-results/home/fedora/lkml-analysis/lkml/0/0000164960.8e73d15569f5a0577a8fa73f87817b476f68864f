CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "current->todo"
#105: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1284:
+	return current->todo != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#128: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1294:
+	if (todo_list_active()) {
[...]
-	}
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*n)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct notifier_block)...)
#259: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:95:
+			n = kmalloc(sizeof(struct notifier_block), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
