Here is the latest version of the swap prefetching patch. Locking issues in 

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#113: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:190:
+extern void prepare_prefetch(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#156: FILE: init/Kconfig:90:
+config SWAP_PREFETCH
+	bool "Support for prefetching swapped memory"
+	depends on SWAP && EXPERIMENTAL
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  This option will allow the kernel to prefetch swapped memory pages
+	  when idle. The pages will be kept on both swap and in swap_cache
+	  thus avoiding the need for further I/O if either ram or swap space
+	  is required.
+	  
+	  What this will do on workstations is slowly bring back applications
+	  that have swapped out after memory intensive workloads back into
+	  physical ram if you have free ram at a later stage and the machine
+	  is relatively idle. This means that when you come back to your
+	  computer after leaving it idle for a while, applications will come
+	  to life faster. Note that your swap usage will appear to increase
+	  but these are cached pages, can be dropped freely by the vm, and it
+	  should stabilise around 50% swap usage.
+	  
+	  Desktop users will most likely want to say Y.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#240: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#241: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:2:
+ * linux/mm/swap_prefetch.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'prepare_prefetch', this function's name, in a string
#293: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:54:
+		panic("prepare_prefetch(): cannot create swapped_entry SLAB cache");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#344: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:105:
+		entry = list_entry(swapped_root.list.next,
+				struct swapped_entry_t, swapped_list);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#358: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:119:
+	if (likely(!error)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#543: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:304:
+		if (!(prefetched = trickle_swap()))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
