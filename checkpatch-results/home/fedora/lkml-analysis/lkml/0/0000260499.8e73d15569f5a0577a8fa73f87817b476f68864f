# ChangeSet

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#82: 
--- a/drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c	2004-08-13 15:35:28 -04:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#92: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:110:
+#define safe_for_read(cmd)	[cmd] = CMD_READ_SAFE

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#98: FILE: drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c:116:
+	static const unsigned char cmd_type[256] = {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
