WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#49: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#50: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:2:
+ * drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#57: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:9:
+ * ^I^ITom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>$

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#81: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:33:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <eth_getDebugChar>
#102: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:54:
+static int eth_getDebugChar(void)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <eth_flushDebugChar>
#115: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:67:
+static void eth_flushDebugChar(void)

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <eth_putDebugChar>
#124: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:76:
+static void eth_putDebugChar(int chr)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#147: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:99:
+			in_head = in_tail = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
#163: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:115:
+__setup("kgdboe=", option_setup);

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#170: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:122:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "kgdb: debugging over ethernet enabled\n");

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct kgdb_io should normally be const
#175: FILE: drivers/net/kgdb_eth.c:127:
+struct kgdb_io kgdb_io_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#221: FILE: lib/Kconfig.debug:148:
+config KGDB_ETH
+	bool "KGDB: On ethernet"
+	select NETPOLL
+	select NETPOLL_TRAP
+	select NETPOLL_RX
+	help
+	  Uses ethernet interface for kgdb.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
