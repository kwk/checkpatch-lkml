WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#46: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:348:
+		extern char swsusp_pg_dir[PAGE_SIZE];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#47: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:349:
+		extern char swsusp_pg_dir[PAGE_SIZE];
+		memcpy(swsusp_pg_dir, swapper_pg_dir, PAGE_SIZE);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
