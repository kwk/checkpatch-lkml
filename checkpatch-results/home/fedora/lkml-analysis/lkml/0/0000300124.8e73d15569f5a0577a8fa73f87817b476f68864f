# This is a BitKeeper generated diff -Nru style patch.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
