WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#45: FILE: fs/unionfs/super.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#67: FILE: fs/unionfs/super.c:23:
+ * vfs inode.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct address_space_operations should normally be const
#72: FILE: fs/unionfs/super.c:28:
+	static struct address_space_operations unionfs_empty_aops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#233: FILE: fs/unionfs/super.c:189:
+	if (!c) {
+		return NULL;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#248: FILE: fs/unionfs/super.c:204:
+static void init_once(void *v, kmem_cache_t * cachep, unsigned long flags)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#349: FILE: fs/unionfs/super.c:305:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#355: FILE: fs/unionfs/super.c:311:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
