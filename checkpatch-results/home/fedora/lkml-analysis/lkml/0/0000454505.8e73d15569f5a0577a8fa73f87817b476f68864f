CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sk"
#54: FILE: net/irda/af_irda.c:129:
+	if (sk == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#55: FILE: net/irda/af_irda.c:130:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#127: FILE: net/irda/af_irda.c:1427:
+			 * is messy. - Jean II */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
