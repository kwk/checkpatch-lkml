Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
