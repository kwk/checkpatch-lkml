WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (16, 18)
#739: FILE: drivers/char/vt_ioctl.c:645:

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#758: FILE: fs/fcntl.c:312:
+		if (!valid_signal(arg)) {
 			break;
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
