ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#74: FILE: drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c:183:
+static int last_sleep = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'funciton' may be misspelled - perhaps 'function'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'last_sleep > BM_JIFFIES'

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
