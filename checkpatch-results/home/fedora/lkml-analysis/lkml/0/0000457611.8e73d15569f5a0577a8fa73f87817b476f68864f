WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'currupt' may be misspelled - perhaps 'corrupt'?
#20: 
the first read, and writes wrote currupt data to the media.
                                 ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:REPEATED_WORD: Possible repeated word: 'very'
#38: 
  (all the '*sectors*' fields) looked very very different from

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#45: 
diff -ruN linux-2.5.16/drivers/block/floppy.c linux-2.5.16.fix-floppy/drivers/block/floppy.c

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#60: FILE: drivers/block/floppy.c:3863:
+		printk("No block device for %s\n", __bdevname(dev));

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#61: FILE: drivers/block/floppy.c:3864:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#98: FILE: drivers/block/floppy.c:3909:
+			struct buffer_head *bh = floppy_getblk0(dev);
+			if (!bh) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
