#29: 
- Merge pmdisk_read() and __read_suspend_image() and rename to swsusp_read()

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#41: 
--- a/kernel/power/disk.c	2004-07-17 14:50:49 -07:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#48: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:28:
+extern int swsusp_read(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#57: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:208:
+	if ((error = swsusp_read()))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#136: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:1148:
+static struct block_device * resume_bdev;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
