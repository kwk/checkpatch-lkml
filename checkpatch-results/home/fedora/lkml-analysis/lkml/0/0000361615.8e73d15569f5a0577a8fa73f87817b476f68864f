WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#81: FILE: kernel/sched.c:82:
+extern unsigned long long monotonic_clock(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Statements, such as::

should be::
