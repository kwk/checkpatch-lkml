#34: 
> It's for aligning function entries to a 16 byte boundary instead of only 4

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'lables' may be misspelled - perhaps 'labels'?
#59: FILE: include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h:10:
+ * This prevents lables defined to mark start/end of section to differ
                  ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#60: FILE: include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h:11:
+ * during pass 1 and pass 2 when generating System.map */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
