Subject: [PATCH] gianfar: Fix sparse warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around priv->regs->rmon
#77: FILE: drivers/net/gianfar.c:456:
+		memset_io(&(priv->regs->rmon), 0, sizeof (struct rmon_mib));

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
