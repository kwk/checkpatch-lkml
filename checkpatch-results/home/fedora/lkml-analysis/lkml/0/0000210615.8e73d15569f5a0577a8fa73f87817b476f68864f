CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around p->swap_address
#107: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:297:
+		if ((error = write_page(p->address, &(p->swap_address))))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#107: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:297:
+		if ((error = write_page(p->address, &(p->swap_address))))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#150: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:371:
+	struct pbe * pbe;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#180: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:576:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

#282: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:631:

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
