WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#75: FILE: include/asm-ppc/ptrace.h:52:
+#define force_successful_syscall_return()   \
+	do { \
+		current_thread_info()->local_flags |= _TIFL_FORCE_NOERROR; \
+	} while(0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#132: FILE: include/asm-ppc/thread_info.h:100:
+#define TIFL_FORCE_NOERROR	0	/* don't return error from current
+					   syscall even if result < 0 */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#135: FILE: include/asm-ppc/thread_info.h:103:
+#define _TIFL_FORCE_NOERROR	(1<<TIFL_FORCE_NOERROR)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
