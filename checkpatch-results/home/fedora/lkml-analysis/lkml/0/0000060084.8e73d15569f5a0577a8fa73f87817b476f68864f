Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#63: FILE: arch/um/kernel/time_kern.c:65:
+	else prev_nsecs = os_nsecs();

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#63: FILE: arch/um/kernel/time_kern.c:65:

+	else prev_nsecs = os_nsecs();

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
