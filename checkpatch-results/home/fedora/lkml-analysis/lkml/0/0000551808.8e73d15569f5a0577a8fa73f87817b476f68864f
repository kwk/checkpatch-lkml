WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#46: FILE: mm/shmem.c:705:
+		buf->f_bavail = buf->f_bfree = nr_free_pages() + nr_swap_pages + atomic_read(&buffermem_pages);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#46: FILE: mm/shmem.c:705:
+		buf->f_bavail = buf->f_bfree = nr_free_pages() + nr_swap_pages + atomic_read(&buffermem_pages);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
