Subject: [patch] x86_64: fix cpu_to_node setup for sparse apic_ids

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#48: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/srat.c:24:
+static unsigned int __initdata num_processors = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after num_processors
#48: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/srat.c:24:
+static unsigned int __initdata num_processors = 0;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
