+	---help---
+	  This is a simple BSD style one-way elevator.  It avoids the complexity
+	  of deadlines, and uses a limit on contiguous I/O sectors to keep things
+	  moving and reduce latency.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

+	default n
+	---help---
+	  Elevator normally uses the C-SCAN one-way elevator algorithm,
+	  which is useful in most situations to avoid queue congestion and
+	  request starvation.  In some cases, SSTF might be higher
+	  performance, particularly with certain localized workloads.
+

+	  This enables extra checking to ensure that Elevator I/O scheduling
+	  is occurring without errors that could effect performance.  It
+	  will print messages into the system log if it detects problems.
+	  If your performance under Elevator is lower than you expect, or if
+	  you would like to monitor for degradation, enable this option.
