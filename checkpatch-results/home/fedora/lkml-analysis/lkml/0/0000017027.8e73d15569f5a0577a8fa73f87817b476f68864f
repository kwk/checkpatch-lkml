CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#61: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:60:
+extern void thaw_processes(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#144: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:181:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING " Strange, %s not stopped\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#145: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:182:

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited before that close parenthesis ')'

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
