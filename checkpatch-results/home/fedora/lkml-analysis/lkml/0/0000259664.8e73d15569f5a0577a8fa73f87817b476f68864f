#31: 
 Subject: [Lhms-devel] Making hotremovable attribute with memory section[2/4]

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#55: FILE: include/linux/mmzone.h:71:
+	struct per_cpu_pages pcp[4];	/* 0: hot-unremovable.  1: cold-unremovable
+					   2: hot-removable     3: cold-removable   */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
