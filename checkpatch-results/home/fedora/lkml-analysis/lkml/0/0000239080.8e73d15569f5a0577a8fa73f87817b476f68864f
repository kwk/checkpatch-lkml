CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "hwif->proc"
#90: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-proc.c:826:
+	int exist = (hwif->proc != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:IF_0: Consider removing the code enclosed by this #if 0 and its #endif
#91: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-proc.c:827:
+#if 0

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#103: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-proc.c:839:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(destroy_proc_ide_interface);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#134: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1079:
+extern void destroy_proc_ide_interface(ide_hwif_t *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_hwif_t *' should also have an identifier name
#134: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1079:
+extern void destroy_proc_ide_interface(ide_hwif_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
