CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/elf.h> instead of <asm/elf.h>
#135: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/elf_aux.c:14:
+#include <asm/elf.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#734: FILE: drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2/sym_hipd.h:154:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#742: FILE: drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2/sym_hipd.h:162:
+#define SYM_MEM_CLUSTER_SHIFT	(PAGE_SHIFT+SYM_MEM_PAGE_ORDER)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
