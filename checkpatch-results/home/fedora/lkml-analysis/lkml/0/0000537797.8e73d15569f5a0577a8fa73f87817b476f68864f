ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#114: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:698:
+                ream_inodes(devi);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#403: FILE: fs/inode.c:526:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#415: FILE: fs/inode.c:538:
+	int res;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#430: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1087:
+extern int ream_inodes(kdev_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'kdev_t' should also have an identifier name
#430: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1087:
+extern int ream_inodes(kdev_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
