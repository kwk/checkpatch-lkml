CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#67: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:1256:
+		if (done == FIFO_EMPTY) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#70: FILE: drivers/block/cciss.c:1259:
+		} else

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#123: FILE: drivers/block/cciss_scsi.c:541:
+	struct cciss_scsi_adapter_data_t * shba;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#220: FILE: drivers/block/cciss_scsi.c:545:
+^I^Ikmalloc(sizeof(*shba), GFP_KERNEL);^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!shba"
#221: FILE: drivers/block/cciss_scsi.c:546:
+	if (shba == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#241: FILE: drivers/block/cciss_scsi.c:555:
+	hba[cntl_num]->scsi_ctlr = (void *) shba;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
