WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 136 exceeds 100 columns
#40: FILE: fs/bfs/inode.c:78:
+        if (inode->i_size || inode->i_blocks) dprintf("Registered inode with %lld size, %lld blocks\n", inode->i_size, inode->i_blocks);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

+        if (inode->i_size || inode->i_blocks) dprintf("Registered inode with %lld size, %lld blocks\n", inode->i_size, inode->i_blocks);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

+        if (inode->i_size || inode->i_blocks) dprintf("Registered inode with %lld size, %lld blocks\n", inode->i_size, inode->i_blocks);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
