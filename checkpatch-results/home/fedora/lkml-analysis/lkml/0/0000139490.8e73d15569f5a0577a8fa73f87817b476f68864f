Subject: [PATCH 11/37] dvb: fix sparse warnings

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

+static int ca_get_slot_info(struct dst_state *state, struct ca_slot_info *p_ca_slot_info, void __user *arg)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
