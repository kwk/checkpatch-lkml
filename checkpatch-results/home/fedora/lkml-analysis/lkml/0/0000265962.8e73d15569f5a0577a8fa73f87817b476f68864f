#32: 
Here's the node physid patch refreshed against the latest BK bits.  It works

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

+static ssize_t node_read_physid(struct sys_device * dev, char * buf)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#92: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:113:
+static SYSDEV_ATTR(physid,S_IRUGO,node_read_physid,NULL);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#120: FILE: include/asm-ia64/topology.h:48:
+extern void node_to_physid(int node, char *buf);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
