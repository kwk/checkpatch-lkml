WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#102: FILE: drivers/net/ppp_generic.c:87:
+	struct ppp_file *detached_list; /* List of detached ppp channels to
+					   free on vfs last close on fd */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'pf->kind == INTERFACE'
#133: FILE: drivers/net/ppp_generic.c:393:
+		if (!pf->detached && (pf->kind == INTERFACE)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#151: FILE: drivers/net/ppp_generic.c:401:
+			struct ppp_file *oldpf;
+			oldpf = pf->detached_list;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
