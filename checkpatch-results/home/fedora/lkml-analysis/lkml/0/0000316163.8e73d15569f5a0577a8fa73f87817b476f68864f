#33: 
Promise raid devices. It hasn't received much testing, so I left the old routine

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '!=' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#60: FILE: drivers/ide/raid/pdcraid.c:367:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
