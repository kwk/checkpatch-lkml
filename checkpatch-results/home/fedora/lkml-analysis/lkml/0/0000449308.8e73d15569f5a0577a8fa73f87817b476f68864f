Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#92: FILE: fs/driverfs/inode.c:352:
+        struct inode *inode = file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mapping->host;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#92: FILE: fs/driverfs/inode.c:352:
+        struct inode *inode = file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mapping->host;$

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#95: FILE: fs/driverfs/inode.c:354:
+^Idown(&inode->i_sem);^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
