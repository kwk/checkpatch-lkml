CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'inode->i_cdev != NULL'
#53: FILE: fs/file_table.c:173:
+	if (unlikely(S_ISCHR(inode->i_mode) && (inode->i_cdev != NULL)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "inode->i_cdev"
#53: FILE: fs/file_table.c:173:
+	if (unlikely(S_ISCHR(inode->i_mode) && (inode->i_cdev != NULL)))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
