#21: 
There have been some updates in the radeonfb that are needed for some cards (especially mobility cards) to work.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#35: FILE: radeonfb.c:881:
+	/* According to XFree86 4.2.0, some production M6's return 0
+	   for 8MB. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
