Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

#135: FILE: include/asm-m32r/checksum.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

#144: FILE: include/asm-m32r/checksum.h:6:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
