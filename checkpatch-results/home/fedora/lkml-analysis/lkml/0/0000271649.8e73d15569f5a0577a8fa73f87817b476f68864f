CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#137: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:769:
+	if (serio->child) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns
#300: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:475:
+		if (psmouse->serio->child && psmouse->serio->child->drv && synaptics_is_pt_packet(psmouse->packet))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "serio->drv"
#335: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serio.c:71:
+	return serio->drv != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'otehr' may be misspelled - perhaps 'other'?
#422: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serio.c:260:
+ * try otehr drivers when binding parent port.
        ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#561: FILE: drivers/input/serio/serio.c:390:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
