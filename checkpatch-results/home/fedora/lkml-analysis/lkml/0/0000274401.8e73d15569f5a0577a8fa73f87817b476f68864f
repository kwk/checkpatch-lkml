>>Don't use this. It will BUG() your kernel hard, because of a double free(). 

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Trace>
#83: FILE: drivers/usb/media/pwc-if.c:1127:
+	Trace(TRACE_OPEN, "pwc_video_release() called.\n");

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pwc_video_release', this function's name, in a string
#83: FILE: drivers/usb/media/pwc-if.c:1127:
+	Trace(TRACE_OPEN, "pwc_video_release() called.\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
