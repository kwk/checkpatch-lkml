ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#126:

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#562: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:322:
+	void (*irq_clear) (struct ata_port *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ata_port *' should also have an identifier name
#562: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:322:
+	void (*irq_clear) (struct ata_port *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#570: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:380:
+extern int ata_qc_issue_prot(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
