CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#126: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:127:
+extern int __rcu_pending(struct rcu_ctrlblk *rcp, struct rcu_data *rdp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
