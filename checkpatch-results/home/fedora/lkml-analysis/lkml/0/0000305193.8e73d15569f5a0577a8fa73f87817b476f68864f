ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#58: 
--- a/drivers/i2c/chips/w83l785ts.c	Mon Feb  9 15:05:54 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#117: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/w83l785ts.c:247:
+	data->temp_over = data->temp = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#132: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/w83l785ts.c:290:
+	 * default value requested by the caller. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

+	dev_err(&client->dev, "Couldn't read value from register. "
+		"Please report.\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
