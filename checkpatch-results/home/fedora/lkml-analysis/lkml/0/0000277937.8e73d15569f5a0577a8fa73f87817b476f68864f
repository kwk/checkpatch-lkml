The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#198: FILE: drivers/input/misc/rawdev.c:87:
+	if (!(rawdev = rawdev_locate(iminor(inode)))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

#208: FILE: drivers/input/misc/rawdev.c:97:
+	if (!(list = kmalloc(sizeof(struct rawdev_list), GFP_KERNEL))) {

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#348: FILE: drivers/input/misc/rawdev.c:237:
+struct file_operations rawdev_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
