ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#71: FILE: drivers/media/common/saa7146_core.c:28:
+static int saa7146_num = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#193: FILE: drivers/media/common/saa7146_vbi.c:133:
+static void saa7146_set_vbi_capture(struct saa7146_dev *dev, struct saa7146_buf *buf, struct saa7146_buf *next)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
