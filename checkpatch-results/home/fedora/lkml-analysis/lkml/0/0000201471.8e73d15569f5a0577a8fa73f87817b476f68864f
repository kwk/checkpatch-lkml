Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/mc146818rtc.h> instead of <asm/mc146818rtc.h>
#200: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/traps.c:41:

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
