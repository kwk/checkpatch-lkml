CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:101:
+extern unsigned long nr_active(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#90: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1673:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
