ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/include/asm-i386/acpi.h

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
