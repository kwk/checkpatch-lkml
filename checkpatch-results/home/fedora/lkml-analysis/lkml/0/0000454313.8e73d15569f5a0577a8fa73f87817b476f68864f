ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#39: 
--- a/drivers/block/genhd.c	Wed May  8 09:53:06 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#49: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:182:
+		int minormask = (1<<sgp->minor_shift) - 1;
 		                  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#50: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:183:
+		int minormask = (1<<sgp->minor_shift) - 1;
+		if ((n & minormask) && sgp->part[n].nr_sects == 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
