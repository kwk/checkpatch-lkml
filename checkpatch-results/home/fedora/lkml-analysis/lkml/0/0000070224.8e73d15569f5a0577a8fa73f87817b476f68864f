CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#153: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:176:
+extern void FASTCALL(lru_cache_add_tail(struct page *));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#153: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:176:
+extern void FASTCALL(lru_cache_add_tail(struct page *));

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#186: FILE: init/Kconfig:103:
+config SWAP_PREFETCH
+	bool "Support for prefetching swapped memory"
+	depends on SWAP
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  This option will allow the kernel to prefetch swapped memory pages
+	  when idle. The pages will be kept on both swap and in swap_cache
+	  thus avoiding the need for further I/O if either ram or swap space
+	  is required.
+
+	  What this will do on workstations is slowly bring back applications
+	  that have swapped out after memory intensive workloads back into
+	  physical ram if you have free ram at a later stage and the machine
+	  is relatively idle. This means that when you come back to your
+	  computer after leaving it idle for a while, applications will come
+	  to life faster. Note that your swap usage will appear to increase
+	  but these are cached pages, can be dropped freely by the vm, and it
+	  should stabilise around 50% swap usage maximum.
+
+	  Workstations and multiuser workstation servers will most likely want
+	  to say Y.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#288: FILE: mm/swap.c:178:
+		BUG_ON(PageLRU(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

#712: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:367:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
