ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#55: 
--- a/drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.c	Sat Aug 30 23:27:18 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "port->tty"
#75: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.c:1407:
+			if (port->tty != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
