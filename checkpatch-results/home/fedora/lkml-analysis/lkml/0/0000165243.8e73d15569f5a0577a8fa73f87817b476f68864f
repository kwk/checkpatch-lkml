WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#44: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#48: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/locomolcd.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'noone' may be misspelled - perhaps 'no one'?
#56: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/locomolcd.c:9:
+ * slightly old hardware, and noone is going to retrofit second CPU to
                               ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#79: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/locomolcd.c:32:
+static struct locomo_dev *locomolcd_dev = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#86: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/locomolcd.c:39:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#167: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/locomolcd.c:120:
+	 * We need to recall poodle_lcd_power here*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#178: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/locomolcd.c:131:
+	unsigned long flags;
+	local_irq_save(flags);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#196: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/locomolcd.c:149:

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#196: FILE: drivers/video/backlight/locomolcd.c:149:
+	if (ret) return ret;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
