CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#270: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_qp.c:406:
+	qp->s_cur = qp->s_tail = qp->s_head;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#516: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_verbs.c:1186:
+			       (unsigned long long) si->n_bytes);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
