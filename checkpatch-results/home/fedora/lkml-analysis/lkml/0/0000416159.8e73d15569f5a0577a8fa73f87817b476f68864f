WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#35: 
# CONFIG_FOO is not set

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Thats' may be misspelled - perhaps 'That's'?
#38: 
Roman - the code uses "//" for comments. Thats not usual kernel style.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#55: FILE: confdata.c:154:
+				else
+				{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#55: FILE: confdata.c:154:
+				}

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
