WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#94: FILE: arch/powerpc/Kconfig:397:
+config PPC_IBM_CELL_BLADE
+	bool "  IBM Cell Blade"
 	depends on PPC_MULTIPLATFORM && PPC64
+	select PPC_CELL
 	select PPC_RTAS
 	select MMIO_NVRAM
 	select PPC_UDBG_16550

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#380: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spu_priv1_mmio.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#385: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spu_priv1_mmio.c:6:
+#include <asm/io.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#487: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spu_priv1_mmio.c:108:
+	u64 smm_hid;
+	smm_hid = in_be64(&spu->priv1->smm_hid);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
