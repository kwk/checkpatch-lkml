Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#434: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.h:12:
+extern int synaptics_detect(struct psmouse *psmouse, int set_properties);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
