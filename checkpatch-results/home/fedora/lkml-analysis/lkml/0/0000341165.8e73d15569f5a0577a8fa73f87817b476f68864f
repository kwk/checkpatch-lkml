Fix typo in @addresses_handled_in_regexp, Bryan O'Sullivan's address got hosed.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file

+# $Id: lk-changelog.pl,v 0.167 2003/08/31 14:08:56 emma Exp $

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
