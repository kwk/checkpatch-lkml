WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#63: FILE: arch/um/Kconfig:231:
+	config SCSI
+		tristate "SCSI support"
 
 # This gives us free_dma, which scsi.c wants.
+	config GENERIC_ISA_DMA
+	config GENERIC_ISA_DMA
+	config GENERIC_ISA_DMA
+	config GENERIC_ISA_DMA

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#77: FILE: arch/um/Kconfig:240:
+	source "arch/um/Kconfig_scsi"

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
