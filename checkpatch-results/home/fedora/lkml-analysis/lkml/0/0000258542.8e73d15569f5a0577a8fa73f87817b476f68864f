Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#109: FILE: kernel/sched.c:922:
+	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(&task_rq(p)->lock));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#109: FILE: kernel/sched.c:922:
+	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(&task_rq(p)->lock));

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()
