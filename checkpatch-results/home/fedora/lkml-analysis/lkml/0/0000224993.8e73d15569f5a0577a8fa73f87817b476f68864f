ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#36: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:136:
+static int __is_prefetch(struct pt_regs *regs)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
