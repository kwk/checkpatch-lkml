CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/mmu_context.h> instead of <asm/mmu_context.h>
#43: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/traps.c:23:
+#include <asm/mmu_context.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#56: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/traps.c:319:
+		/* Irritating users can call PAL_clrfen to disable the
+		   FPU for the process.  The kernel will then trap in

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
