CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bqt"
#56: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:719:
+	if (unlikely(bqt == NULL || tag >= bqt->max_depth))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#78: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:792:
+	tag_map = kmalloc(nr_ulongs * sizeof(unsigned long), GFP_ATOMIC);

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.
