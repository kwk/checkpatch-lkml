ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#49: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:309:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#49: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:309:
+		}

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
