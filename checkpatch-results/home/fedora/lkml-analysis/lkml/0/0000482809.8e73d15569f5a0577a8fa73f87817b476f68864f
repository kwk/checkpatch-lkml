WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#98: FILE: affs/file.c:522:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#159: FILE: affs/file.c:597:
+				affs_warning(sb, "extent_file_ofs", "next block already set for %d (%d)", bidx, tmp);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#171: FILE: affs/file.c:607:
+	inode->i_size = AFFS_INODE->mmu_private = newsize;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Page_Uptodate>
#209: FILE: affs/file.c:652:
+	if (Page_Uptodate(page))

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#321: FILE: affs/file.c:903:
+			u32 tmp;
+			if (IS_ERR(ext_bh)) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#322: FILE: affs/file.c:904:

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.
