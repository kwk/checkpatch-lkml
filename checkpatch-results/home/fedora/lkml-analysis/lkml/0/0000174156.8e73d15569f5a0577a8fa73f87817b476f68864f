WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#84: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#88: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1374.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#89: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1374.c:2:
+ * drivers/i2c/chips/ds1374.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'recommened' may be misspelled - perhaps 'recommended'?
#106: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1374.c:19:
+ * recommened in .../Documentation/i2c/writing-clients section
    ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+		s32 tmp;
+		if ((tmp = i2c_smbus_read_byte_data(save_client, reg)) < 0) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#159: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1374.c:72:
+		if ((tmp = i2c_smbus_read_byte_data(save_client, reg)) < 0) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#240: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1374.c:153:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*client)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_client)...)
#290: FILE: drivers/i2c/chips/ds1374.c:203:
+	client = kmalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_client), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
