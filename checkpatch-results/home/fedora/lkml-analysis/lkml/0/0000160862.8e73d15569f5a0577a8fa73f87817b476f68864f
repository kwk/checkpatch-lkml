WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#96: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:805:
+		if (oldusage == 0) {
+			return 0;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#104: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:813:
+extern void __put_task_struct_cb(struct rcu_head *rhp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
