Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#70: 
--- a/drivers/usb/core/urb.c	Tue Apr 29 14:07:13 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#127: FILE: drivers/usb/core/urb.c:414:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(usb_init_urb);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#138: FILE: include/linux/usb.h:769:
+extern int usb_init_urb(struct urb *urb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
