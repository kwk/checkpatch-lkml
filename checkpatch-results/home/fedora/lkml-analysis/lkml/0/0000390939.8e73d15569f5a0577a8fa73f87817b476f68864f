WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#135: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug.c:344:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(pci_remove_behind_bridge);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pci_dev *' should also have an identifier name
#144: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:648:
+void pci_remove_bus_device(struct pci_dev *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
