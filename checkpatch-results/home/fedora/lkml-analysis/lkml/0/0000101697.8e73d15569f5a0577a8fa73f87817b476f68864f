Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
