ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#115: FILE: drivers/net/e100.c:2585:
+	nic->cb_to_use = nic->cb_to_send = nic->cb_to_clean = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
