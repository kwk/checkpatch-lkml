WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#69: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:163:
+static struct file_operations proc_sys_file_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
