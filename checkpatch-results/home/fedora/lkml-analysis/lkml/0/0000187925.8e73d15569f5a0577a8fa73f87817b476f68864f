ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#58: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/time.c	2005-04-25 15:42:40 -07:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#65: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/time.c:444:
+	if ((hpet_enable() >= 0) && hpet_use_timer) {
 		printk("Using HPET for base-timer\n");
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

+	if (unlikely(((offset - hpet_last) >= (2*hpet_tick)) && (hpet_last != 0))) {
 	                                        ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'hpet_last != 0'
#185: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_hpet.c:112:
+	if (unlikely(((offset - hpet_last) >= (2*hpet_tick)) && (hpet_last != 0))) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
