WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#73: FILE: drivers/input/input.c:562:
+static struct list_head *list_get_next_element(struct list_head *list, struct list_head *element, loff_t *pos)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#113: FILE: drivers/input/input.c:602:
+#define SEQ_PRINTF_BIT(ev, bm)						\
 	do {								\
+		input_seq_print_bitmap(seq, #ev,			\
+				       dev->bm##bit, ev##_MAX);		\
 	} while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

WARNING:PREFER_SEQ_PUTS: Prefer seq_puts to seq_printf

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#184: FILE: drivers/input/input.c:649:
+static struct seq_operations input_devices_seq_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
