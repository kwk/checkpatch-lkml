CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#41: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:750:
+	capa = max = amperage = voltage = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#42: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c:751:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
