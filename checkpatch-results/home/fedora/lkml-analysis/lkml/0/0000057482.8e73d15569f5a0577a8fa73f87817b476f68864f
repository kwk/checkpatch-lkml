ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#42: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:46:
+#define RQ_CIC(rq)		((struct cfq_io_context*)(rq)->elevator_private)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rq1"
#114: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:256:
+	if (rq1 == NULL || rq1 == rq2)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rq2"
#116: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:258:
+	if (rq2 == NULL)

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#163: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:318:
+	case (CFQ_RQ1_WRAP|CFQ_RQ2_WRAP): /* both rqs wrapped */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#187: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:338:
+cfq_find_next_rq(struct cfq_data *cfqd, struct cfq_queue *cfqq,
+		  struct request *last)

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#353: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:898:
+		if ((rq = cfq_check_fifo(cfqq)) == NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#461: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:1599:
+	BUG_ON(!cfqq->next_rq);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
