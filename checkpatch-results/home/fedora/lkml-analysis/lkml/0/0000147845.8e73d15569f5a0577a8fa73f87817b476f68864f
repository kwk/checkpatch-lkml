Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

#52: FILE: kernel/rcupdate.c:111:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
