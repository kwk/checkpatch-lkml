CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#42: FILE: include/linux/device.h:357:
+extern struct device *find_device(const char *name, struct bus_type *bus);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#55: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:405:
+       struct kobject *k = kset_find_obj(&bus->devices, name);$

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#56: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:406:
+       struct kobject *k = kset_find_obj(&bus->devices, name);
+       if (k)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
