#31: 
It's a bit strange to see tty_register_ldisc() call in modules' exit functions.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#100: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:294:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(tty_unregister_ldisc);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#112: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:348:
+extern int tty_unregister_ldisc(int disc);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
