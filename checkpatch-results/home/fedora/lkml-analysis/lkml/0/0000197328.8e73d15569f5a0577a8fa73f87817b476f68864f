Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'MSDOS' may be misspelled - perhaps ''?
#24: 
MSDOS doesn't have ->adate and ->c{date,time}, those should be filled
^^^^^

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#44: FILE: fs/msdos/namei.c:269:
+	de.cdate = de.adate = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
