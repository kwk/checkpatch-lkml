#32: 
Prevents a race where sys_sched_setaffinity can race with sched_migrate_task

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#133: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2639:
+	if (any_online_cpu(new_mask) == NR_CPUS) {

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#171: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2673:

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
