CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#279: FILE: include/asm-i386/thread_info.h:125:
+#define _TIF_VM86		(1<<TIF_VM86)
                  		  ^

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#279: FILE: include/asm-i386/thread_info.h:125:
+#define _TIF_VM86		(1<<TIF_VM86)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
