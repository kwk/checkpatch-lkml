WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#87: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:60:
+extern unsigned long node_start_pfn[], node_end_pfn[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
