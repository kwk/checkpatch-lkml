CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#83: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:535:
+extern unsigned long page_to_pfn(struct page *page);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#84: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:536:
+extern struct page* pfn_to_page(unsigned long pfn);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
