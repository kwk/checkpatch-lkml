Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/rtc.h:105:
+extern int rtc_year_days(unsigned int day, unsigned int month, unsigned int year);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
