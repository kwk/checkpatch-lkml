Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#110: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:315:
+	/* 'active' is true if the local APIC was enabled by us and
+	   not the BIOS; this signifies that we are also responsible

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#129: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:334:
+void __init setup_lapic (void)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#139: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:475:
+	if (nmi_watchdog == NMI_LOCAL_APIC) {
+		enable_lapic_nmi_watchdog();
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 123 exceeds 100 columns

+	set_fixmap_nocache(FIX_APIC_BASE, APIC_DEFAULT_PHYS_BASE);	/* FIXME: this is needed for S3 resume, but why? */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#360: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:1241:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
