Signed-Off-By: Matt Helsley <matthltc@us.ibm.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#47: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_numtasks.c:32:
+static int total_cnt_alloc = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#93: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_numtasks.c:139:
+		if (res->forks_in_period >= forkrate) {
+			return 0;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#136: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_numtasks.c:233:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#192: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_numtasks.c:461:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#210: FILE: kernel/ckrm/ckrm_numtasks.c:479:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
