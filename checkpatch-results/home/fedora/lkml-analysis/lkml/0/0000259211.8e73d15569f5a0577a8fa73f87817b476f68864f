#27: 
This patch changes the rusage bookkeeping and the semantics of the getrusage

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#253: FILE: kernel/fork.c:530:
+	tsk->nvcsw = tsk->nivcsw = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#337: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1480:
+	BUG_ON(!tsk->ptrace &&

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
