CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#84: FILE: fs/dcache.c:123:
+static void dcache_shrinker_add(struct dcache_shrinker *ds,
+		struct dentry *parent, struct dentry *dentry)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#86: FILE: fs/dcache.c:125:
+	if (parent != dentry) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ds"
#99: FILE: fs/dcache.c:138:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#242: FILE: fs/dcache.c:461:
+static void prune_one_dentry(struct dentry * dentry)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#452: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:212:
+extern void shrink_dcache_anon(struct super_block *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct super_block *' should also have an identifier name
#452: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:212:
+extern void shrink_dcache_anon(struct super_block *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
