ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#58: FILE: arch/um/kernel/umid.c:250:
+^I        printf("Failed to mkdir %s: %s\n", uml_dir, strerror(errno));$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'make_umid', this function's name, in a string
#68: FILE: arch/um/kernel/umid.c:267:
+			(*printer)("make_umid - mkstemp(%s) failed: %s\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
