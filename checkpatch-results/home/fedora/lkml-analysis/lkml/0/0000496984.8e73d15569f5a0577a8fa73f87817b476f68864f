spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'show_trace_task', this function's name, in a string
#35: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/traps.c:92:
+       printk("show_trace_task() - not implemented yet.\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
