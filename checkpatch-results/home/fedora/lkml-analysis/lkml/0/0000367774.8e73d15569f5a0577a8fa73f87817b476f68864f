WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#60: FILE: drivers/oprofile/oprof.c:29:
+/* timer
+   0 - use performance monitoring hardware if available

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#63: FILE: drivers/oprofile/oprof.c:32:
+static int timer = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
