Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dentry *' should also have an identifier name
#44: FILE: include/linux/nfs_xdr.h:368:
+	int	(*unlink_done) (struct dentry *, struct rpc_task *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
