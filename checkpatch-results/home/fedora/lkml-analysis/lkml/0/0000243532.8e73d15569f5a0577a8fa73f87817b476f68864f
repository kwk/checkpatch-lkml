WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 127 exceeds 100 columns
#78: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:118:
+extern int vm_vfs_scan_ratio, vm_cache_scan_ratio, vm_lru_balance_ratio, vm_passes, vm_gfp_debug, vm_mapped_ratio, vm_anon_lru;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
