Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *   bar" should be "foo *bar"
#48: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/wavelan_cs.c:4386:
+  struct net_local *   lp;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#65: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/wavelan_cs.c:4482:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
