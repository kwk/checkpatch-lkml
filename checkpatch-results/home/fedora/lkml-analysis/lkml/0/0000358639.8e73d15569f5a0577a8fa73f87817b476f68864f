The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#465: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:177:
+		extern void note_interrupt(int, irq_desc_t*, irqreturn_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#465: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:177:
+		extern void note_interrupt(int, irq_desc_t*, irqreturn_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'irq_desc_t*' should also have an identifier name
#465: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:177:
+		extern void note_interrupt(int, irq_desc_t*, irqreturn_t);

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \

                    do_this(b, c);          \
