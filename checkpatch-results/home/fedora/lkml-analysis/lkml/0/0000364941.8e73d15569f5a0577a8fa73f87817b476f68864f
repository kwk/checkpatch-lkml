ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#35: 
--- a/drivers/hotplug/ibmphp_core.c	Wed Jun  4 18:12:01 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dev->vendor == PCI_VENDOR_ID_SERVERWORKS'
#58: FILE: drivers/hotplug/ibmphp_core.c:949:
+					if ((dev->vendor == PCI_VENDOR_ID_SERVERWORKS) &&
+					    (dev->device == 0x0101))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#60: FILE: drivers/hotplug/ibmphp_core.c:951:
+						ibmphp_hpc_writeslot (slot_cur, HPC_BUS_100PCIXMODE);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
