ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#75: 
--- a/drivers/scsi/libata-core.c	Sun Feb 29 12:30:47 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#121: FILE: include/scsi/scsi_cmnd.h:162:
+extern void scsi_finish_command(struct scsi_cmnd *cmd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
