ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#38: 
--- a/include/linux/kobject.h	Mon Jan 19 17:05:23 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#44: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:59:
+extern void kobject_hotplug(const char *action, struct kobject *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct kobject *' should also have an identifier name
#44: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:59:
+extern void kobject_hotplug(const char *action, struct kobject *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#58: FILE: lib/kobject.c:204:
+	struct kobject * top_kobj = kobj;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#61: FILE: lib/kobject.c:207:
+	/* If this kobj does not belong to a kset,
+	   try to find a parent that does. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#61: FILE: lib/kobject.c:207:
+	   try to find a parent that does. */
