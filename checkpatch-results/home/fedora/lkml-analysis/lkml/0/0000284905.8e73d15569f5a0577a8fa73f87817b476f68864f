CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "strchr"
#55: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:1474:
+	if (strchr(options, ':') != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#62: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:1481:
+		int fbnamelen = strchr(options, ':') - options;
+		options[fbnamelen] = '\0';

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#63: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:1482:
+		printk ("Requested framebuffer device '%s' not found\n", options);

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#63: FILE: drivers/video/fbmem.c:1482:
+		printk ("Requested framebuffer device '%s' not found\n", options);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#79: FILE: drivers/video/aty/radeon_monitor.c:860:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#81: FILE: drivers/video/aty/radeon_monitor.c:862:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#85: FILE: drivers/video/aty/radeon_monitor.c:865:
+				 rinfo->mon1_modedb, rinfo->mon1_dbsize, &default_mode, default_bpp) == 0)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
