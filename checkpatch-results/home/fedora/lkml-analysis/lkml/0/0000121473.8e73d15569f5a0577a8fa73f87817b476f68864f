Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'manupulation' may be misspelled - perhaps 'manipulation'?
#34: 
in page_replace.c; the place where all list manupulation happens.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct zone *' should also have an identifier name
#59: FILE: include/linux/mm_page_replace.h:41:
+void page_replace_candidates(struct zone *, int, struct list_head *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
