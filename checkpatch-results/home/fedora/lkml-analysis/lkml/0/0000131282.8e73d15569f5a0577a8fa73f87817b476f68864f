ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#64: FILE: drivers/video/fbsysfs.c:495:
+static ssize_t store_fbstate(struct class_device *class_device, const char * buf,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#72: FILE: drivers/video/fbsysfs.c:503:
+	state = simple_strtoul(buf, &last, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#95: FILE: drivers/video/fbsysfs.c:534:
+	__ATTR(state, S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR, show_fbstate, store_fbstate),

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
