ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#87: FILE: drivers/macintosh/via-macii.c:298:
+	if (via[IFR] & SR_INT) macii_interrupt(0, NULL, NULL);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

+        lp->lance.lance_init_block = NULL;              /* LANCE addr of same RAM */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
