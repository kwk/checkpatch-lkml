CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#150: FILE: fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:73:
+	curr = next = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#156: FILE: fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:79:
+		if (block_start <= curr->end) {
[...]
+		} else if (!next || block_start < next->start) {
[...]
+		else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#177: FILE: fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:100:
+		}
+		else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#188: FILE: fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:111:
+	switch(action) {
+		case BACK_MERGE:
[...]
+		case FRONT_MERGE:
[...]
+		case THREE_WAY_MERGE:
[...]
+		case INSERT:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }
