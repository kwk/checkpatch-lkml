ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#48: FILE: Documentation/scsi/ChangeLog.megaraid:1:
<atulm@lsil.com>

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#81: FILE: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_mbox.c:200:
 static uint8_t megaraid_mbox_version[8] =
+	{ 0x02, 0x20, 0x04, 0x00, 9, 27, 20, 4 };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
