ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#63: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:104:
"UDMA133" };

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#69: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c:108:
+struct via82cxxx_dev
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
