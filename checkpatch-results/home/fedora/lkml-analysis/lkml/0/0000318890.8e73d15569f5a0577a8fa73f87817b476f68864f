WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#62: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:148:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(blk_queue_activity_fn);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#133: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:975:
+extern int ideprobe_init_module(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#209: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe.c:1373:

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#223: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe-mini.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#224: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe-mini.c:2:
+ *  linux/drivers/ide/ide-probe-mini.c	Version 1

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#239: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-probe-mini.c:17:
+extern void ideprobe_cleanup_module(void);
