WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'reenable' may be misspelled - perhaps 're-enable'?

 	      	     		   ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#280: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/ptrace.c:62:
+	BUG_ON(child->thread.regs && (child->thread.regs->msr & MSR_FP));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#521: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/ptrace.h:64:
+extern void ptrace_flush_child_fp(struct task_struct *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct task_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#521: FILE: include/asm-ppc64/ptrace.h:64:
+extern void ptrace_flush_child_fp(struct task_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
