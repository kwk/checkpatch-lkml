CHECK:UNCOMMENTED_DEFINITION: spinlock_t definition without comment
#67: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:936:
+	spinlock_t delays_lock;

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#81: FILE: kernel/delayacct.c:46:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
