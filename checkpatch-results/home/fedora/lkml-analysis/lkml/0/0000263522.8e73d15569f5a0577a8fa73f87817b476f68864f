The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: include/linux/moduleparam.h:142:
+extern int param_get_string(char *buffer, struct kernel_param *kp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#69: FILE: kernel/params.c:341:
 }
+int param_get_string(char *buffer, struct kernel_param *kp)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
