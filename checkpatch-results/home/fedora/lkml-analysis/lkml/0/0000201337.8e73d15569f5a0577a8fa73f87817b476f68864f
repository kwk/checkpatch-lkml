WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#88: FILE: sound/pci/cs4281.c:1334:
+static inline int snd_cs4281_create_gameport(cs4281_t *chip) { return -ENOSYS; }

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
