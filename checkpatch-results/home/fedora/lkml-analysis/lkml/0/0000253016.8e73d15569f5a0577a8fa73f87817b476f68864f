ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#90: 
--- a/fs/super.c	2004-09-05 03:54:23 +02:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#150: FILE: include/linux/kobj_notify.h:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#156: FILE: include/linux/kobj_notify.h:7:
+extern int kobj_notify(const char *signal, struct kobject *kobj,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
