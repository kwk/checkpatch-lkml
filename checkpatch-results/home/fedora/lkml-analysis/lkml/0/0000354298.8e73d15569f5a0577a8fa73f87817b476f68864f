Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+	printk (KERN_INFO "Freeing unused kernel memory: %dk freed\n", (__init_end - __init_begin) >> 10);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
