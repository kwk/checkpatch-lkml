#30: 
Change i386 nmi handler to handle 32 bit perfmon counter MSR writes cleanly.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#56: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:234:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
