ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/2.4.22pre6aa1/, so with that patch it's actually a fix.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#64: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:677:
+extern void steal_locks(fl_owner_t from);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
