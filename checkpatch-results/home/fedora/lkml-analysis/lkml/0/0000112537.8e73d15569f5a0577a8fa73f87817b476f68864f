CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#204: FILE: kernel/sched_spa_ws.c:201:
+	if (avg_lshares <= pshares)
[...]
 	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#246: FILE: kernel/sched_spa_ws.c:230:
+static inline int spa_sleepiness_exceeds_ppt(const struct task_struct *p,
+					    unsigned int ppt)

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#262: FILE: kernel/sched_spa_ws.c:247:
 	}
+	else if (!spa_sleepiness_exceeds_ppt(p, iab_decr_threshold))

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
