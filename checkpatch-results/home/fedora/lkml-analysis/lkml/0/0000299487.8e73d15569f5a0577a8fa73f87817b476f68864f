ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *			bar" should be "foo *bar"
#68: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape.h:202:

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#206: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape_class.c:1:

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#240: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape_class.c:35:
+	struct file_operations *fops,

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cdev"
#271: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape_class.c:66:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#278: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape_class.c:73:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
