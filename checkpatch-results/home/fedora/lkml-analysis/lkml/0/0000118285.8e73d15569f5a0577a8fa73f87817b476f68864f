ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#126: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:103:
+extern s32 i2c_smbus_write_i2c_block_data(struct i2c_client * client,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#126: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:103:
+extern s32 i2c_smbus_write_i2c_block_data(struct i2c_client * client,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
