Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!root->rnode"
#138: FILE: lib/radix-tree.c:299:
+	if (root->rnode == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#156: FILE: lib/radix-tree.c:511:
+__lookup(struct radix_tree_root *root, void ***results, unsigned long index,
 	unsigned int max_items, unsigned long *next_index)

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#170: FILE: lib/radix-tree.c:523:
+	shift = (height-1) * RADIX_TREE_MAP_SHIFT;
 	               ^

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around slot->slots[i]
#208: FILE: lib/radix-tree.c:549:
+			results[nr_found++] = &(slot->slots[i]);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
