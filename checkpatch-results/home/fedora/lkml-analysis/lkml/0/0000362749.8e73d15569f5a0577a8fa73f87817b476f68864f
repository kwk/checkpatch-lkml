#33: 
I've come up with a way of doing automounting from within the VFS (see patch)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#167: FILE: fs/namei.c:441:
+	for (;;) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#170: FILE: fs/namei.c:444:
+			struct vfsmount *mounted;
+			spin_lock(&dcache_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
