ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#288: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:430:
+int shmem_lock(struct file * file, int lock);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#300: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:582:
+/* mlock can just return an instant EPERM if the caller has no
+   permission to do any memory locking. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
