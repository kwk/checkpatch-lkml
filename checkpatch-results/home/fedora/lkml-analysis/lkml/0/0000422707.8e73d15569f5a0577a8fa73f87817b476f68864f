Please look inside for comments. Seems to work pretty well; it has alread=

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#180: FILE: fs/ext3/acl.c:182:
+ext3_set_acl(handle_t *handle, struct inode *inode, int type,
 		struct posix_acl *acl)

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#267: FILE: fs/ext3/acl.c:411:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#298: FILE: fs/ext3/acl.h:65:
+extern int ext3_acl_chmod (struct inode *);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#298: FILE: fs/ext3/acl.h:65:
+extern int ext3_acl_chmod (struct inode *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct inode *' should also have an identifier name
#298: FILE: fs/ext3/acl.h:65:
+extern int ext3_acl_chmod (struct inode *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
