#23: 
This is the second of several mails containing patches to be included in 2.4.19.  Some are worthy of dicussion prior to inclusion and have been marked as such.  The majority of these patches were found on lkml; the remaining ones have URLs listed.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'definately' may be misspelled - perhaps 'definitely'?
#27: 
This version at least will compile on all arches that 2.4.19-pre1 will, and a note is given for arches where the sparse golden ratio prime given is definately not the optimal (non-32bit arches).  I will try to help wli find a better prime for 64bit soon.  Testing on other arches is, of course, appreciated.
                                                                                                                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
