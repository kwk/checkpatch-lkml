ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#52: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:18:
+unsigned int i8042_dmi_noloop = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#81: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:892:
+^I/*      $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
