WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'pathes' may be misspelled - perhaps 'paths'?
#51: 
      There are also places where relative pathes are used. This takes
                                           ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#76: 
Content-Description: automatically adapted references to moved files in Documentation/

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#94: FILE: Documentation/block/biodoc.txt:327:
=20

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#158: FILE: Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt:1:
+For now this is a raw copy from the old Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt,

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#485: FILE: include/asm-s390/ccwdev.h:72:
+ * Reference: Documentation/s390/driver-model.txt */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
