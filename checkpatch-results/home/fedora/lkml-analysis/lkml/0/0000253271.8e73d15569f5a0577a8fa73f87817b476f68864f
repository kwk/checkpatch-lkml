CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/thread_info.h> instead of <asm/thread_info.h>
#46: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/time.c:36:
+#include <asm/thread_info.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#125: FILE: include/asm-arm/ptrace.h:135:
+extern unsigned long profile_pc(struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
