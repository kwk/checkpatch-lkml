#72: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c:1:
+/* drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#72: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c:1:
+/* drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#83: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c:12:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#120: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c:49:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#128: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c:57:
+
+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*led)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct s3c24xx_gpio_led)...)
#146: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c:75:
+	led = kzalloc(sizeof(struct s3c24xx_gpio_led), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!led"
#147: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c:76:
+	if (led == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:OOM_MESSAGE: Possible unnecessary 'out of memory' message
#148: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c:77:
+	if (led == NULL) {

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#186: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c:115:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#226: FILE: drivers/leds/leds-s3c24xx.c:155:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
