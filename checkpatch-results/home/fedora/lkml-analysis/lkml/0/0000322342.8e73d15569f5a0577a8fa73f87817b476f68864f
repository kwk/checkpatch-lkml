ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#64: FILE: seq_file.c:216:
+			if(offset >= 0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#65: FILE: seq_file.c:217:
+				retval = file->f_pos = offset;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
