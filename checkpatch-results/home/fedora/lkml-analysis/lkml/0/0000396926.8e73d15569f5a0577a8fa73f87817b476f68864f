ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#76: FILE: net/e2100.c:310:
+	((unsigned int*)hdr)[0] =3D isa_readl(shared_mem);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
