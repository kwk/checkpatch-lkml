I wanted to export a binary blob via debugfs, and although it was pretty easy

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#54: FILE: fs/debugfs/file.c:258:
+	struct debugfs_blob_wrapper *blob = file->private_data;
+	return simple_read_from_buffer(user_buf, count, ppos, blob->data,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#58: FILE: fs/debugfs/file.c:262:
+static struct file_operations fops_blob = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
