Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#59: 
>kernel/exit.c:59: warning: implicit declaration of function `proc_pid_unhash'

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#89: 
//  EXTRAVERSION = -mm1
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#119: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:804:
+	BUG_ON(p->pids[PIDTYPE_PID].pidptr != &p->pids[PIDTYPE_PID].pid);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'synchroneous' may be misspelled - perhaps 'synchronous'?
#178: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1091:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "proc_dentry"
#193: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1106:
+	if (proc_dentry != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#194: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1107:
+	if (proc_dentry != NULL) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#196: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1109:

[...]

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#199: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1112:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'directoy' may be misspelled - perhaps 'directory'?

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
