WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#42: FILE: mm/shmem.c:42:
+static struct inode_operations shmem_symlink_inode_operations;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#86: FILE: mm/shmem.c:803:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <UnlockPage>
#97: FILE: mm/shmem.c:814:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#108: FILE: mm/shmem.c:825:
+	struct page * page;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
