WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#29: 
Signed-Off-By: Alasdair G Kergon <agk@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#57: FILE: drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c:525:
+	if (!(param->flags & DM_SKIP_BDGET_FLAG)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

+	} else

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#103: FILE: include/linux/dm-ioctl.h:306:
+#define DM_SKIP_BDGET_FLAG	(1 << 9) /* In */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
