WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#39: 
#ifdef __powerpc__ probably should be changed to some form of #ifdef

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#48: 
--- a/Documentation/Configure.help	Thu Sep 13 19:20:29 2001

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

#105: FILE: drivers/net/yellowfin.c:1112:
+		frame_status = le16_to_cpu(get_unaligned((s16*)&(buf_addr[data_size - 2])));

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around buf_addr[data_size - 2]
#105: FILE: drivers/net/yellowfin.c:1112:
+		frame_status = le16_to_cpu(get_unaligned((s16*)&(buf_addr[data_size - 2])));

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
