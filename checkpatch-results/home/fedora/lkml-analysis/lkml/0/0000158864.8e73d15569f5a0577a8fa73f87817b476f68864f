WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 112 exceeds 100 columns
#172: FILE: drivers/usb/core/hcd.c:785:
+	bus->class_dev = class_device_create(usb_host_class, MKDEV(0,0), bus->controller, "usb_host%d", busnum);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
