WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#132: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_sysfs.c:172:
+	BUG_ON(spin_is_locked(sdev->sdev_lock));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:USE_LOCKDEP: Where possible, use lockdep_assert_held instead of assertions based on spin_is_locked
#132: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_sysfs.c:172:
+	BUG_ON(spin_is_locked(sdev->sdev_lock));

lockdep_assert_held() annotations should be preferred over
assertions based on spin_is_locked()

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/locking/lockdep-design.html#annotations
