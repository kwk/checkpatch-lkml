WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'n_hdlc_tty_write', this function's name, in a string
#58: FILE: drivers/char/n_hdlc.c:660:
+		printk("%s(%d)n_hdlc_tty_write() called count=%zu\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
