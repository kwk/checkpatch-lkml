ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#51: FILE: fs/ext3/ialloc.c:514:
+	if (err) goto fail;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#52: FILE: fs/ext3/ialloc.c:515:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
