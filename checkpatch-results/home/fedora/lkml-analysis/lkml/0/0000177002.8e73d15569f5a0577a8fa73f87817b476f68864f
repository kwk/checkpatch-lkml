WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#47: 
# diff -puN /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/sis190.c sis190.c

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#114: FILE: sis190.c:481:
+               if (desc->status & OWNbit)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
