CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <_MACH_Pmac>
#71: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pmac_feature.c:687:
+	if (_machine != _MACH_Pmac)

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#101: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/pmac_feature.c:717:
+	pmac_agp_suspend = pmac_agp_resume = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
