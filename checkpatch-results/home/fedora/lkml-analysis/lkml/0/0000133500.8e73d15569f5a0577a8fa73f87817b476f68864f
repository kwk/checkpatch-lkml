CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#42: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:182:
+extern int migrate_pages(struct list_head *l, struct list_head *t,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#43: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:183:
+extern int migrate_pages(struct list_head *l, struct list_head *t,
+		struct list_head *moved, struct list_head *failed);
