> > drivers/net/irda/vlsi_ir.c:2047: `PROC_DIR' undeclared (first use in this function)

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#77: FILE: drivers/net/irda/vlsi_ir.c:153:
+static struct proc_dir_entry *vlsi_proc_root = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "vlsi_proc_root"
#109: FILE: drivers/net/irda/vlsi_ir.c:1809:
+	if (vlsi_proc_root != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#123: FILE: drivers/net/irda/vlsi_ir.c:1821:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
