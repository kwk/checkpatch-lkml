WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#48: FILE: include/asm-s390/pgtable.h:789:
+static inline pte_t ptep_xchg(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long address, pte_t *ptep, pte_t pteval)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
