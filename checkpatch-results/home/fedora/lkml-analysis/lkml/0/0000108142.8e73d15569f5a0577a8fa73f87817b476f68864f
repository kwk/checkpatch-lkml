CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#178: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:54:
+extern int cpuset_mem_spread_node(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#314: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1764:
+	if ((err = cpuset_add_file(cs_dentry, &cft_mem_spread)) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
