### 1. With the original code, all requests are queued in FIFO order.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

### 3. With sorting fixed, backward seeking optimization becomes bogus.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
