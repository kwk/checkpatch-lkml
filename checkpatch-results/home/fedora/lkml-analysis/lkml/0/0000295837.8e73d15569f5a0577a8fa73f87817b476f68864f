#27: 
[PATCH] I2C: fix up CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CORE logic to be simpler on the .c files.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#38: 
--- a/drivers/i2c/Makefile	Mon Mar 15 14:34:23 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
