CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!node"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'unregister_node', this function's name, in a string
#84: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:139:
+		printk("unregister_node: node is null.");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#111: FILE: include/linux/node.h:29:
+extern int __devinit register_node(struct node *, int, struct node *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct node *' should also have an identifier name
#111: FILE: include/linux/node.h:29:
+extern int __devinit register_node(struct node *, int, struct node *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
