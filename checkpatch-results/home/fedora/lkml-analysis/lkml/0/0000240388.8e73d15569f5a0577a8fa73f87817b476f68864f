ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#112: FILE: fs/ntfs/attrib.c:978:
+		memmove((u8*)a + new_size, (u8*)a + le32_to_cpu(a->length),

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#130: FILE: fs/ntfs/attrib.h:87:
+extern int ntfs_attr_record_resize(MFT_RECORD *m, ATTR_RECORD *a, u32 new_size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
