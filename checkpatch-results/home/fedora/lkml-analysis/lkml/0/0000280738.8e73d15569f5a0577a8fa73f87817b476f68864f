I hope this is the right ML to post, if not please enlighten me where to ask :-)

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#47: 
--- a/net/ipv6/icmp.c   Tue Apr 27 18:37:22 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
