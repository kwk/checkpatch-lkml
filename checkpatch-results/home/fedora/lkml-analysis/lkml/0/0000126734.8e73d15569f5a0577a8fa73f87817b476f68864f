CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*slot)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct slot)...)
#78: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/shpchp_core.c:116:
+		slot = kmalloc(sizeof(struct slot), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#118: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/shpchp_core.c:142:
+		slot->hpc_ops = hpc_ops = ctrl->hpc_ops;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around hotplug_slot_info->power_status
#150: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/shpchp_core.c:158:
+			&(hotplug_slot_info->power_status));

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around hotplug_slot_info->attention_status
#152: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/shpchp_core.c:160:

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around hotplug_slot_info->latch_status
#154: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/shpchp_core.c:162:

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around hotplug_slot_info->adapter_status
#156: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/shpchp_core.c:164:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#159: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/shpchp_core.c:167:
+		dbg("Registering bus=%x dev=%x hp_slot=%x sun=%x "
+			"slot_device_offset=%x\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
