CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:39:
+extern int __delayacct_add_tsk(struct taskstats *, struct task_struct *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct taskstats *' should also have an identifier name
#67: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:39:
+extern int __delayacct_add_tsk(struct taskstats *, struct task_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
