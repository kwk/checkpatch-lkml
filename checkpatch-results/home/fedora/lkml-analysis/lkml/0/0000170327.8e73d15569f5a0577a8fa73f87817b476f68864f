+config IOMAP_CHECK
+	bool "Support iochk interfaces for IO error detection."
+	depends on PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
+	---help---
+	  Saying Y provides iochk infrastructure for "RAS-aware" drivers
+	  to detect and recover some IO errors, which strongly required by
+	  some of very-high-reliable systems.
+	  The implementation of this infrastructure is highly depend on arch,
+	  bus system, chipset and so on.
+	  Currentry, very few drivers on few arch actually implements this.
+
+	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
