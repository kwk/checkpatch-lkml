CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/mmu_context.h> instead of <asm/mmu_context.h>
#42: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/ldt.c:21:
+#include <asm/mmu_context.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
