Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
