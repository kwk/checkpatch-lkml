CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#104: FILE: fs/nfs/read.c:186:
+	data->inode	  = inode = req->wb_inode;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#218: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs.h:368:
+extern void nfs_readpage_result(struct rpc_task *task, unsigned int count);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#254: FILE: include/linux/nfs_xdr.h:364:
+	void	(*read_setup)   (struct nfs_read_data *, unsigned int count);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct nfs_read_data *' should also have an identifier name
#254: FILE: include/linux/nfs_xdr.h:364:
+	void	(*read_setup)   (struct nfs_read_data *, unsigned int count);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

#275: FILE: fs/nfs/proc.c:476:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#276: FILE: fs/nfs/proc.c:477:
+	struct nfs_read_data *data = (struct nfs_read_data *) task->tk_calldata;
+	nfs_readpage_result(task, data->u.v3.res.count);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
