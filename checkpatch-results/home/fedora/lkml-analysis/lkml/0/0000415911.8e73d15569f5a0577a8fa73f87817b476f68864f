                        ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#93: FILE: include/linux/genhd.h:288:
+extern void init_disk(struct gendisk *disk, int minors);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#124: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:389:
+/* init_disk assumes disk should is initialized to all zeroes,
+   except for disk->part, which points to the partitions structures,

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#125: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:390:
+   which are also assumed to be initialized to all zeroes. */

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#161: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:409:
+		disk->part = (struct hd_struct*) &disk[1];

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#161: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:409:
+		disk->part = (struct hd_struct*) &disk[1];

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#173: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:433:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(init_disk);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
