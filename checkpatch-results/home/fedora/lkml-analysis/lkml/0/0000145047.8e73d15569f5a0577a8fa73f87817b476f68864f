#32: 
patch adds the PCI error recovery callbacks to the Symbios SCSI device driver.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#65: FILE: drivers/scsi/Kconfig:1065:
+config SCSI_SYM53C8XX_EEH_RECOVERY
+	bool "Enable PCI bus error recovery"
+	depends on SCSI_SYM53C8XX_2 && PPC_PSERIES
+	help
+		If you say Y here, the driver will be able to recover from
+		PCI bus errors on many PowerPC platforms. IBM pSeries users
+		should answer Y.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
