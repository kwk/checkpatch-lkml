ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#35: 
--- a/drivers/sbus/sbus.c	Tue Jun 10 17:04:09 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!pci_find_device"
#42: FILE: drivers/sbus/sbus.c:337:
+			if (pci_find_device(PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, NULL) == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
