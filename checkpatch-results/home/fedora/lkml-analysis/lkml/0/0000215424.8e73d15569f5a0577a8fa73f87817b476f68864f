WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 111 exceeds 100 columns
#44: FILE: drivers/ide/pci/cmd64x.c:563:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "%s: ROM enabled at 0x%16llx\n", name, dev->resource[PCI_ROM_RESOURCE].start);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

as the last construct.
