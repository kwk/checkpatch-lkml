WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 125 exceeds 100 columns
#181: FILE: drivers/scsi/sata_promise.c:481:
+static inline unsigned int pdc_interrupt_common(int irq, void *dev_instance, struct pt_regs *regs, unsigned int hotplug_regs)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
