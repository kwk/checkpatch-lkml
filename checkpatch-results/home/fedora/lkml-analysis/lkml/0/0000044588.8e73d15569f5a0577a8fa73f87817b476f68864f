Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/kallsyms.h:15:
+extern int kallsyms_lookup_size_offset(unsigned long addr,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#61: FILE: include/linux/kallsyms.h:16:
+extern int kallsyms_lookup_size_offset(unsigned long addr,
+				  unsigned long *symbolsize,

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#113: FILE: kernel/kallsyms.c:176:
+	BUG_ON(!kallsyms_addresses);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
