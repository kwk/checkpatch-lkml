	* Insure that negative rss values are not given out by the /proc filesystem

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#63: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:259:
+static long inline get_rss(struct mm_struct *mm)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#68: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:264:
+		 mm->rss = rss = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
