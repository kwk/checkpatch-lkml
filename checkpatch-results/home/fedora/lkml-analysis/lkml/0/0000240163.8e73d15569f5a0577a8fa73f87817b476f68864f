WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#77: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-prosavage.c:184:
+static int i2c_register_bus(struct pci_dev *dev, struct s_i2c_bus *p, void __iomem *mmvga, u32 i2c_reg)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
