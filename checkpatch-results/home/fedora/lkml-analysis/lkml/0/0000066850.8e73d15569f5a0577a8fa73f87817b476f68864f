CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_FORCE_DMA				(1<<1)
                              				  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#41: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:36:
+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_FORCE_DMA				(1<<1)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
