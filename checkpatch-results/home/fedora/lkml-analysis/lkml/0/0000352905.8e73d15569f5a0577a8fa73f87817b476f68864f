WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#78: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/setup.c:271:
+	extern char _end[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#87: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/setup.c:280:
+	memset_io(PTRRELOC((char*)__bss_start), 0, _end - __bss_start);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#133: FILE: arch/ppc/syslib/prom_init.c:710:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
