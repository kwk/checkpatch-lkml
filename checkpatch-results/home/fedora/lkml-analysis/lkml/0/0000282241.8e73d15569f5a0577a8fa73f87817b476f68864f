ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#82: FILE: mm/mmap.c:532:
+static inline unsigned long __do_mmap_pgoff(struct file * file, unsigned long addr,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#202: FILE: mm/mmap.c:814:
+		file = hugetlb_file = hugetlb_zero_setup(len);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
