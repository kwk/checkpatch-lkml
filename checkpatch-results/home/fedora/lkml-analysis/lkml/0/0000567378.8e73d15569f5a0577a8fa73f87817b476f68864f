The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

+static int rd_make_request(request_queue_t * q, int rw, struct buffer_head *sbh)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
