ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#87: FILE: kernel/stop_machine.c:26:
+struct stop_machine_data
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#89: FILE: kernel/stop_machine.c:28:
+	int (*fn)(void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
