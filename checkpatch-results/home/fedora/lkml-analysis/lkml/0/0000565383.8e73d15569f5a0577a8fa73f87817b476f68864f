CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#50: FILE: filemap.c:2468:
+	inode->i_ctime = inode->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
