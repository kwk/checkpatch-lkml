The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#143: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/lbtouch.c:89:
+	psmouse->ptport = port = kmalloc(sizeof(struct psmouse_ptport), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*port)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct psmouse_ptport)...)
#143: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/lbtouch.c:89:
+	psmouse->ptport = port = kmalloc(sizeof(struct psmouse_ptport), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
