WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'analagous' may be misspelled - perhaps 'analogous'?
#84: 
  not analagous to find_lock_page().  Rename it
      ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#166: FILE: mm/hugetlb.c:385:
+	 * event of a race with truncate() */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
