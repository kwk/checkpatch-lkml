CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#89: FILE: include/linux/timex.h:349:
+extern u64 current_tick_length(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited before that close parenthesis ')'
#112: FILE: kernel/timer.c:773:
+	if ((time_adjust_step = time_adjust) != 0 ) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#112: FILE: kernel/timer.c:773:
+	if ((time_adjust_step = time_adjust) != 0 ) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:MINMAX: min() should probably be min_t(long, time_adjust_step, tickadj)
#117: FILE: kernel/timer.c:778:
+		time_adjust_step = min(time_adjust_step, (long)tickadj);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#121: FILE: kernel/timer.c:782:
+	return ((u64) delta_nsec << (SHIFT_SCALE - 10)) + time_adj;
