WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#140: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:106:
+	 * otherwise specified.*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#157: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:115:
+^I *^Iwrite all taskfile registers (except data) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#215: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:167:
+			u16 data =  taskfile->data + (hobfile->data << 8);
+			hwif->OUTW(data, IDE_DATA_REG);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'approch' may be misspelled - perhaps 'approach'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#272: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:206:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(do_taskfile);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#424: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1301:
+extern ide_startstop_t do_taskfile(ide_drive_t *, ide_task_t *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#424: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1301:
+extern ide_startstop_t do_taskfile(ide_drive_t *, ide_task_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_task_t *' should also have an identifier name
#424: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1301:
+extern ide_startstop_t do_taskfile(ide_drive_t *, ide_task_t *);
