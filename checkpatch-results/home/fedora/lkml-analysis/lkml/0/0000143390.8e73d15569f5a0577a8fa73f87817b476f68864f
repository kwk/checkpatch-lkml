Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.
