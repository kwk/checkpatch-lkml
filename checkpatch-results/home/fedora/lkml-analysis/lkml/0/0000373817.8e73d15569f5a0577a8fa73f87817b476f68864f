ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#57: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/netwave_cs.c:1459:
+static irqreturn_t netwave_interrupt(int irq, void* dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs) {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#57: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/netwave_cs.c:1459:
+static irqreturn_t netwave_interrupt(int irq, void* dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#124: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/wavelan.c:3033:
+	 * need to pad. Jean II */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!skb"
#127: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/wavelan.c:3036:
+		if (skb == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
