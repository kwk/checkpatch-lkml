CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#113: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:261:
+				if (cs->def[S_DEF_USER].tri != no) {
[...]
 				} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#122: FILE: scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:268:
+			cs->def[S_DEF_USER].tri = E_OR(cs->def[S_DEF_USER].tri, sym->def[S_DEF_USER].tri);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#232: FILE: scripts/kconfig/symbol.c:603:
+		sym->def[S_DEF_USER].val = val = malloc(size);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
