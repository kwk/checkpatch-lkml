#44: 
I had tested this change against 2.6.13-rc2-mm1, and it worked perfectly as expected, but it caused problems in today's 2.6.13-rc2-mm2 release.  For some reason, the symbols don't get set properly.  The following patch corrects this problem and restores previous behavior.  We will eventually have to remove these symbols alltogether when we find a better solution, but this will fix the bug until then.
