Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#218: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:514:
+		from_start = to_start = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 122 exceeds 100 columns
#390: FILE: drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c:610:
+		bh->bi_voffset = bh->bi_io_vec[0].bv_offset = (unsigned long) pc->s.scsi_cmd->request_buffer & ~PAGE_MASK;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
