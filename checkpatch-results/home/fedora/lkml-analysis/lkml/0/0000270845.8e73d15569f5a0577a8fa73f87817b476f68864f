WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Infact' may be misspelled - perhaps 'In fact'?
#58: 
Infact maybe we should just call ptrace_unlink unconditionally there,
^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'approch' may be misspelled - perhaps 'approach'?
#65: 
so maybe on the same lines of my yesterday fix, a cleaner approch could
                                                          ^^^^^^^

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#85: FILE: kernel/exit.c:74:
+	BUG_ON(p->ptrace);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
