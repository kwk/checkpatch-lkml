RT lock ( first ) + prev-task lock ( next ) should be sufficent.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#127: FILE: kernel/sched.c:76:
+static unsigned long rt_status = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#229: FILE: kernel/sched.c:103:
+	if (!rt_task(p)) {
[...]
-		if (p->prio > MAX_PRIO-1)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
