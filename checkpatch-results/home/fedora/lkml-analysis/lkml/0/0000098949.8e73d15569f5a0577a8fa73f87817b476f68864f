WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#86: FILE: fs/nfs/file.c:321:
+	BUG_ON(PagePrivate(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Uptodate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Up-to-date'?
#94: FILE: fs/nfs/file.c:329:
+	 * However we can clear the Uptodate flag so we get the desired
 	                            ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#132: FILE: fs/nfs/pagelist.c:152:
+	struct page *page = req->wb_page;
+	if (page != NULL) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "page"
#132: FILE: fs/nfs/pagelist.c:152:
+	if (page != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
