#31: 
I have an IBM x346 with some Adaptec 7902 SCSI controllers; one has HostRAID

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#54: 
Signed-Off-By: Darrick Wong <djwong@us.ibm.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#65: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_osm_pci.c:46:
+static int attach_HostRAID = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <attach_HostRAID>
#65: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_osm_pci.c:46:
+static int attach_HostRAID = 0;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#66: FILE: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_osm_pci.c:47:
+module_param_named(attach_HostRAID, attach_HostRAID, int, S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR);

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
