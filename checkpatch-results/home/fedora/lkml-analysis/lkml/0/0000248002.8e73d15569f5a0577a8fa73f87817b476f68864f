CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#89: FILE: drivers/md/dm-log.c:309:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#126: FILE: drivers/md/dm-log.c:388:
+ *--------------------------------------------------------------*/

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros starting with if should be enclosed by a do - while loop to avoid possible if/else logic defects
#165: FILE: drivers/md/dm-log.c:604:
+#define	DMEMIT_SYNC \
+	if (lc->sync != DEFAULTSYNC) \
+		DMEMIT("%ssync ", lc->sync == NOSYNC ? "no" : "")

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
