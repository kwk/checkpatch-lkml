Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#38: FILE: sis_main.c:1033:

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#38: FILE: sis_main.c:1033:
+               if(!poha)
+                 {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::
