CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!key"
#133: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:114:
+	if (key == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited after that open parenthesis '('
#176: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:259:
+	if ( key )

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited before that close parenthesis ')'

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#222: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:396:
+	prev = page = key->root;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!key->root"
#247: FILE: arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:415:
