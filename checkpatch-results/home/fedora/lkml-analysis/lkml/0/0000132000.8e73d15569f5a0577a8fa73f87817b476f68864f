WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#72: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_helper_pptp.c:115:
+	BUG_ON(ct->status & IPS_NAT_DONE_MASK);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#77: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_helper_pptp.c:120:
+	range.min_ip = range.max_ip
+		= ct->master->tuplehash[!exp->dir].tuple.dst.ip;

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#80: FILE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_helper_pptp.c:123:
+		range.min = range.max = exp->saved_proto;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
