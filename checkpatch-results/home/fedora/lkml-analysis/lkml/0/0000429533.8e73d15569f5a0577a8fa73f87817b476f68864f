ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#56: FILE: home/rasmus/transport/linux-2.5.38/mm/numa.c:43:
+struct page * alloc_pages_node(int nid, gfp_t gfp_mask, unsigned int order)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
