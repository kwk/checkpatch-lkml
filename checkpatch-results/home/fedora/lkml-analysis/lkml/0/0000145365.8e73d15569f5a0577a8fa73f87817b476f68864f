CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/asm-i386/io_apic.h:199:
+extern unsigned char io_apic_read_index (int ioapic);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
