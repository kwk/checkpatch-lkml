ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#51: 
--- a/drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c~fix-sense-key-medium-error-processing-and-retry

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!scsi_end_request"
#74: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:875:
+	    scsi_end_request(cmd, 1, good_bytes, result == 0) == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
