ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#98: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:40:
+int vm_swap_full (void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#98: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:40:
+int vm_swap_full (void) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#141: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:161:
+extern int vm_swap_full(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
