Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#55: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/core_cia.c:393:
+		/* CIA rev 1 can't use W1 or W2 for SG, apparently,
+		   so use W3, which we made sure is not used for DAC. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
