#30: 
Also, this patch adds arch_init_kprobes to sparc64 to fix the sparc64 kprobes

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/linux/kprobes.h:158:
+extern int arch_init_kprobes(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
