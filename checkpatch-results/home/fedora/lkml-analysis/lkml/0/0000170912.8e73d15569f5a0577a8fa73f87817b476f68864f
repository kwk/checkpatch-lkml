+/* we do not use L[0] = C0[...] ^ C1[...] ^ ... ^ rc[r]
+** due to gcc -O2 (3.4.3) optimizer bug:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
