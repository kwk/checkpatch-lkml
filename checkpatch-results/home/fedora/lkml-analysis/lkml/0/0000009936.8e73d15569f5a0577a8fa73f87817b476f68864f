 >> Doh! Thanks for explaining that. Here's a respun patch with your suggestion

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#84: FILE: fs/libfs.c:359:
+int __simple_fill_super(struct super_block *s, int magic,
+			struct tree_descr *files, bool registered)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#96: FILE: fs/libfs.c:387:
+         * will assign to an inode$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#135: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1882:
+extern int __simple_fill_super(struct super_block *s, int magic,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#136: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1883:
+extern int __simple_fill_super(struct super_block *s, int magic,
+				struct tree_descr *files, bool registered);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
