ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#59: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:578:
+^I^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#61: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:580:
+			/* Adjust the baud rate to match, in case we're
+			   already using the port */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
