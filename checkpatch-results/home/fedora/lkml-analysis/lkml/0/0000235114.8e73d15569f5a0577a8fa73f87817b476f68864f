ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#51: FILE: drivers/pci/bus.c:78:
+void __devinit pci_bus_add_device(struct pci_dev *dev) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
