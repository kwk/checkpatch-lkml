Signed-Off-By: Alasdair G Kergon <agk@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#89: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:899:
+	BUG_ON(old_md != MINOR_ALLOCED);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
