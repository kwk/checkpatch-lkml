CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bio"
#196: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:488:
+		if (unlikely(bio == NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#240: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:531:
+		if (i + nvecs < rbh->bi_vcnt) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#244: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:535:
+		} else

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#263: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:554:
+		bv->bv_page = alloc_page(__GFP_NOWARN|__GFP_HIGHMEM);
 		                                     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bv->bv_page"
#264: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:555:
+		if (bv->bv_page == NULL)

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Lo_bound>
#324: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:608:
+	if (lo->lo_state != Lo_bound) {

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#350: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:641:
+		if ((ret = loop_transfer_bio(lo, new_bio, old_bio)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
