WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#79: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:382:
+	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&nmi_active) != 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#124: FILE: include/asm-i386/nmi.h:26:
+extern void stop_apic_nmi_watchdog (void *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#124: FILE: include/asm-i386/nmi.h:26:
+extern void stop_apic_nmi_watchdog (void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
