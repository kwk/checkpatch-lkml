CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bio"
#190: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:486:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#238: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:533:
+		} else

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#257: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:552:
+		bv->bv_page = alloc_page(__GFP_NOWARN|__GFP_HIGHMEM);
 		                                     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bv->bv_page"
#258: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:553:
+		if (bv->bv_page == NULL)

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#325: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:667:
+		if ((ret = loop_transfer_bio(lo, bio, rbh))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
