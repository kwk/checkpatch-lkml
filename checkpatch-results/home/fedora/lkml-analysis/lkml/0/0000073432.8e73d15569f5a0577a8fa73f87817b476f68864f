WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#136: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1364:
+#define local_irq_set(flags)	do { local_save_flags((flags)); local_irq_enable_in_hardirq(); } while (0)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
