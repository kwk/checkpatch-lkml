Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
