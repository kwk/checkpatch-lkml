CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!res"
#53: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/pci.c:350:
+	if (res == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#67: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/pci.c:664:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#68: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/pci.c:665:

+		       "assuming it starts at 0\n", node->full_name);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#70: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/pci.c:667:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
