Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Function declarations without arguments like::

should be::
