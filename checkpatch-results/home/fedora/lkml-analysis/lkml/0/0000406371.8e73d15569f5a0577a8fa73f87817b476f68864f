Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#352: FILE: drivers/oprofile/oprofile_files.c:70:
+static ssize_t dump_write(struct file *file, char const * buf, size_t count, loff_t * offset)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#359: FILE: drivers/oprofile/oprofile_files.c:77:
+static struct file_operations dump_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#396: FILE: include/linux/oprofile.h:58:
+extern void oprofile_add_sample(unsigned long eip, unsigned long event, int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
