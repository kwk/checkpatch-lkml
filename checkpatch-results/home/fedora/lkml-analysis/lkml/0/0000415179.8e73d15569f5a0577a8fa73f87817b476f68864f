ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#97: FILE: net/ipv4/arp.c:1148:
+static inline unsigned int get_arp_pos(loff_t pos, unsigned int* idx) {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#97: FILE: net/ipv4/arp.c:1148:
+static inline unsigned int get_arp_pos(loff_t pos, unsigned int* idx) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#177: FILE: net/ipv4/arp.c:1226:
+	if (bucket < ARP_FIRST_PNEIGH) {
+		return arp_get_bucket(seq, pos);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#199: FILE: net/ipv4/arp.c:1248:
+		BUG_ON((*pos < make_arp_pos(ARP_FIRST_NEIGH, 0)) || (*pos >= make_arp_pos(ARP_FIRST_PNEIGH, 0)));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#199: FILE: net/ipv4/arp.c:1248:
+		BUG_ON((*pos < make_arp_pos(ARP_FIRST_NEIGH, 0)) || (*pos >= make_arp_pos(ARP_FIRST_PNEIGH, 0)));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
