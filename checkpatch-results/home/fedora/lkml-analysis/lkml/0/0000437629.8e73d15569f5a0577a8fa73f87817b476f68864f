ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/arch/alpha/kernel/irq.c	2002-08-23 12:43:29.000000000 -0500

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#581: FILE: include/linux/blk.h:85:
+extern void add_timer_randomness(void *src, int datum);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
