CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#142: FILE: fs/ntfs/attrib.c:473:
+	ntfs_debug("Entering for i_ino 0x%lx, vcn 0x%llx, with%s ctx.",
+			ni->mft_no, (unsigned long long)vcn, ctx ? "" : "out");

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#162: FILE: fs/ntfs/attrib.c:510:
+		if (IS_ERR(ctx->mrec))
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#196: FILE: fs/ntfs/attrib.c:1195:
+	BUG_ON(IS_ERR(ctx->mrec));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
