ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#61: 
--- a/arch/arm/kernel/time.c	Tue Mar  2 19:52:41 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#303: FILE: drivers/base/sys.c:171:
+int sysdev_register(struct sys_device * sysdev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#322: FILE: drivers/base/sys.c:393:

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#332: FILE: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c:960:
+                if (sysdev_register(&device_i8042) == 0)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#383: FILE: include/linux/sysdev.h:73:
+extern int sysdev_register(struct sys_device *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct sys_device *' should also have an identifier name
#383: FILE: include/linux/sysdev.h:73:
+extern int sysdev_register(struct sys_device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
