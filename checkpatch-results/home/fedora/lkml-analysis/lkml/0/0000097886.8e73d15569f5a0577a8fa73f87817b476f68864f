#92: FILE: char/drm/blade_drv.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#166: FILE: char/drm/blade_drv.c:75:
+static int vblank_wait(struct drm_device * dev, unsigned int *sequence)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
