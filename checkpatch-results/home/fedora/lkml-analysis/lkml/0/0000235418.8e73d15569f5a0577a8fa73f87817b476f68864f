ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#49: FILE: scripts/kallsyms.c:135:
+	else if (toupper(s->type) == 'A')
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#59: FILE: scripts/kallsyms.c:145:
+	}
+	else if (toupper(s->type) == 'U' ||

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
