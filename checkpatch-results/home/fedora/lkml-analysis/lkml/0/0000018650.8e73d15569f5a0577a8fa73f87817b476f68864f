#30: 
- use the orphanage as a shelter for ccw_devices that can't remain on the same

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct subchannel *' should also have an identifier name
#183: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.h:187:
+int sch_is_pseudo_sch(struct subchannel *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
