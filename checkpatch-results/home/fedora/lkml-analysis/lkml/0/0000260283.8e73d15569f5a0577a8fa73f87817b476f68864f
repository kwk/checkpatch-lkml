WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_lock_operations should normally be const
#168: FILE: fs/lockd/clntproc.c:430:
+static struct file_lock_operations nlmclnt_lock_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#175: FILE: fs/lockd/clntproc.c:437:
+	BUG_ON(fl->fl_ops != NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "fl->fl_ops"
#175: FILE: fs/lockd/clntproc.c:437:
+	BUG_ON(fl->fl_ops != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#223: FILE: fs/lockd/clntproc.c:556:
+		status = nlmclnt_async_call(req, NLMPROC_UNLOCK,
 					nlmclnt_unlock_callback);
