ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#59: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:105:
+int ic_wait __initdata = 0;			/* wait until a device appears? */

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#71: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:1111:
+		if(!ic_wait) return -1;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
