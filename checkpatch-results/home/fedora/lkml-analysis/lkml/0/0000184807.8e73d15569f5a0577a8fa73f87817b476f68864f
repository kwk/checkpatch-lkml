ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#91: FILE: modprobe.c:955:
+	char * name;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#97: FILE: modprobe.c:961:
+	struct alias_module *new = NOFAIL(malloc(sizeof(struct alias_module)));
+	new->next = *alias_module;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros starting with if should be enclosed by a do - while loop to avoid possible if/else logic defects
#177: FILE: modprobe.c:1240:
+#define HANDLE_ONE_MODULE()						\
+	if (list_empty(&list)) {					\
+		/* The dependencies have to be real modules, but	\

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#180: FILE: modprobe.c:1243:
+		/* The dependencies have to be real modules, but	\
+		   handle case where the first is completely bogus. */	\

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
