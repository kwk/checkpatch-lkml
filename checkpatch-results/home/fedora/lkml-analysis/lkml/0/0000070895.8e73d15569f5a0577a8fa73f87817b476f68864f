WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#216: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:1223:
+			if (nfsi->cache_validity & (NFS_INO_INVALID_ATTR|NFS_INO_INVALID_ATIME)) {
[...]
 			} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#251: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:1307:
+	if ((nfsi->cache_validity & NFS_INO_REVAL_PAGECACHE)
+			|| nfs_attribute_timeout(inode))

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#286: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs.h:304:
+extern int nfs_revalidate_mapping(struct inode *inode, struct address_space *mapping);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
