#33: 
I was able to reproduce the timer problem on a Xeon generic box, where my patch caused the same thing: a duplicate entry for the timer was programmed in the IO-APIC. The fact that it worked for es7000 was unfortunately just a coincidence :( I investigated it more and found that the legacy irq overwrite code had a bit of deficiency, which was revealed with our overwrite case. Please consider the following problem.

#57: 
The problem happens when the dest_irq (pin) numerically smaller than the bus irq and is assigned higher array element (we index of the srcbus_irq) that the original bus irq with default correspondence. The mp_irqs[] element with new bus irq gets changed allright, but there is still the original (unmodified) element with default one-to-one assignment above it in the array: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ^^^^^^^^
