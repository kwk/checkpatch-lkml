#26: 
This patch cleans up the object to index mapping that has been spread around

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#52: FILE: mm/slab.c:620:
+	return (unsigned)(obj - slab->s_mem) / cache->buffer_size;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#135: FILE: mm/slab.c:2466:
+	BUG_ON(objp != index_to_obj(cachep, slabp, objnr));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
