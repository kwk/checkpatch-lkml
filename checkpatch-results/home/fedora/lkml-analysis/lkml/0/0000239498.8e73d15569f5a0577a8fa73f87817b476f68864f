CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#66: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:79:
+#define BLK_NR_COMP_QUEUES	(1 << BLK_NR_COMP_SHIFT)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#71: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:84:
+};
+static DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct blk_completion_queue, blk_cpu_done);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#173: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:3080:
+	BUG_ON(!blk_pc_request(req) && !blk_fs_request(req));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#184: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:3091:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(end_that_request_completely);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#185: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:3092:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#204: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:3205:
+	for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++) {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#284: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:593:
+extern void end_that_request_completely(struct request *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct request *' should also have an identifier name
#284: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:593:
+extern void end_that_request_completely(struct request *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
