WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#87: FILE: drivers/net/smc91x.c:1360:
+		if (schedule_work(&lp->phy_configure)) {
+			lp->work_pending = 1;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#100: FILE: drivers/net/smc91x.c:1548:
+^I^I   smc_phy_configure are pending. $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#100: FILE: drivers/net/smc91x.c:1548:
+		/* We need to ensure that no calls to
+		   smc_phy_configure are pending. 

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
