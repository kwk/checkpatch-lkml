Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:DUPLICATED_SYSCTL_CONST: duplicated sysctl range checking value 'zero', consider using the shared one in include/linux/sysctl.h
#134: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:1005:
+		.extra1		= &zero,

Commit d91bff3011cf ("proc/sysctl: add shared variables for range
check") added some shared const variables to be used instead of a local
copy in each source file.

Consider replacing the sysctl range checking value with the shared
one in include/linux/sysctl.h.  The following conversion scheme may
be used::

  &zero     ->  SYSCTL_ZERO
  &one      ->  SYSCTL_ONE
  &int_max  ->  SYSCTL_INT_MAX
