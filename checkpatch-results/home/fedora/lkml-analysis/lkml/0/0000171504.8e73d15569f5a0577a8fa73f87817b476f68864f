WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#54: FILE: drivers/connector/Kconfig:24:
+config EXIT_CONNECTOR
+	bool "Enable exit connector"
+	select CONNECTOR
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  It adds a connector in kernel/exit.c:do_exit() function. When a exit
+	  occurs, netlink is used to transfer information about the process and
+	  its parent. This information can be used by a user space application.
+	  The exit connector can be enable/disable by sending a message to the
+	  connector with the corresponding group id.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
