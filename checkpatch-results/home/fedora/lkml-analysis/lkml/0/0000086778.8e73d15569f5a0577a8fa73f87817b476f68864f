CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#433: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:103:
+	filler_t *filler = (filler_t *) mapping->a_ops->readpage;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#434: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:104:
+	filler_t *filler = (filler_t *) mapping->a_ops->readpage;
+	return read_cache_page(mapping, index, filler, data);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
