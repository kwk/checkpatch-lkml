CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <TryLockPage>
#133: FILE: mm/swap_state.c:220:
+	if (TryLockPage(new_page))

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#134: FILE: mm/swap_state.c:221:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <UnlockPage>
#161: FILE: mm/swap_state.c:253:
+	UnlockPage(new_page);

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#264: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:467:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#264: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:467:
+
+	

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
