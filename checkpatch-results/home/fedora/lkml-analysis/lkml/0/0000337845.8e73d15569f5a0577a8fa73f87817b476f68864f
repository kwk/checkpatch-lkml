ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#44: 
--- a/drivers/pcmcia/cs.c	Wed Sep 10 23:18:32 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#284: FILE: include/pcmcia/ss.h:252:
+extern int pcmcia_socket_dev_suspend(struct device *dev, u32 state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
