CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#95: FILE: net/khttpd/main.c:284:
 		{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <LeaveFunction>
#126: FILE: net/khttpd/waitheaders.c:137:
+	LeaveFunction("WaitForHeaders");

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Buffer>
#134: FILE: net/khttpd/waitheaders.c:181:

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!Buffer[CPUNR]"
#134: FILE: net/khttpd/waitheaders.c:181:
+	if (Buffer[CPUNR] == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_crit([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_crit(dev, ... then pr_crit(...  to printk(KERN_CRIT ...
#136: FILE: net/khttpd/waitheaders.c:183:
+		printk(KERN_CRIT "khttpd: lost my buffer");

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#137: FILE: net/khttpd/waitheaders.c:184:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
