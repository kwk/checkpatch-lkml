WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#78: FILE: drivers/video/aty/atyfb_base.c:407:
+	{ PCI_CHIP_MACH64GR, "3D RAGE XL (Mach64 GR, PCI-33MHz)", 235, 83, 63, ATI_CHIP_264XL | M64F_SDRAM_MAGIC_PLL },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
