This new version reduces the number of changes required by users of the agpgart

# This is a BitKeeper generated diff -Nru style patch.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#51:

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

#66: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drmP.h:782:
+extern DRM_AGP_MEM   *DRM(alloc_agp)(struct agp_bridge_data *bridge, int pages, u32 type);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+extern DRM_AGP_MEM    *DRM(agp_allocate_memory)(struct agp_bridge_data *bridge, size_t pages, u32 type);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {
