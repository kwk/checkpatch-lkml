#32: 
This patch series creates a strndup_user() function in order to avoid duplicated

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: include/linux/string.h:21:
+extern char *strndup_user(const char __user *, long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'const char __user *' should also have an identifier name
#58: FILE: include/linux/string.h:21:
+extern char *strndup_user(const char __user *, long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'long' should also have an identifier name
#58: FILE: include/linux/string.h:21:
+extern char *strndup_user(const char __user *, long);

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
