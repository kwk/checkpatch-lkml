Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#135: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1235:
+		drive->capacity = (unsigned long) drive->capacity48;

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#195: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1703:
+	if (!drive->forced_geom) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
