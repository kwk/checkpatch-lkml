WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct agp_bridge_data *' should also have an identifier name
#47: FILE: drivers/char/agp/agp.h:114:
+	void *(*agp_alloc_page)(struct agp_bridge_data *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#116: FILE: drivers/char/agp/i460-agp.c:513:
+static void *i460_alloc_page (struct agp_bridge_data *bridge)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#134: FILE: drivers/char/agp/intel-agp.c:272:
+	case 1: addr = agp_bridge->driver->agp_alloc_page(agp_bridge);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
