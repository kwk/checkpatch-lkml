#37: 
special-case code in device_attach has been replaced with a FIXME comment.  

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#66: FILE: drivers/base/dd.c:31:
+static void __device_bind_driver(struct device * dev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
