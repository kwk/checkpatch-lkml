WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 127 exceeds 100 columns
#71: FILE: fs/inode.c:299:
+static int invalidate_list(struct list_head *head, struct super_block * sb, struct list_head * dispose, struct list_head *mark)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#71: FILE: fs/inode.c:299:
+static int invalidate_list(struct list_head *head, struct super_block * sb, struct list_head * dispose, struct list_head *mark)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#88: FILE: fs/inode.c:318:
+			BUG_ON(mark->next != next);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: fs/inode.c:320:
+			tmp = next = mark->next;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#103: FILE: fs/inode.c:367:
+	marker = kmalloc(sizeof(*marker), SLAB_KERNEL|__GFP_REPEAT);
 	                                             ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
