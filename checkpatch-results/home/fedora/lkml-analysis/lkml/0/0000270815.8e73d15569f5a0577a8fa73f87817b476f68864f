WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#85: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/time.c:116:
+	extern unsigned long prof_cpu_mask;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#118: FILE: arch/ppc/oprofile/Kconfig:5:
+config PROFILING
+	bool "Profiling support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
+	help
+	  Say Y here to enable the extended profiling support mechanisms used
+	  by profilers such as OProfile.
+
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#154: FILE: arch/ppc/oprofile/init.c:1:
+/**

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo ** bar" should be "foo **bar"
#168: FILE: arch/ppc/oprofile/init.c:15:
+extern void timer_init(struct oprofile_operations ** ops);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
