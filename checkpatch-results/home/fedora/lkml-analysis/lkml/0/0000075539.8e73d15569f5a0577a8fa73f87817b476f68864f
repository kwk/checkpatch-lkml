WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#51: FILE: Documentation/block/ionice.c:1:
+#include <stdio.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#60: FILE: Documentation/block/ionice.c:10:
+extern int sys_ioprio_get(int, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#60: FILE: Documentation/block/ionice.c:10:
+extern int sys_ioprio_get(int, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#60: FILE: Documentation/block/ionice.c:10:
+extern int sys_ioprio_get(int, int);

CHECK:ARCH_DEFINES: architecture specific defines should be avoided
#62: FILE: Documentation/block/ionice.c:12:
+#if defined(__i386__)

Architecture specific defines should be avoided wherever
possible.

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent
#119: FILE: Documentation/block/ionice.c:69:
+	switch (ioprio_class) {
+		case IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE:
[...]
+		case IOPRIO_CLASS_RT:
+		case IOPRIO_CLASS_BE:
[...]
+		case IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE:
[...]
+		default:

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#142: FILE: Documentation/block/ionice.c:92:
+		if (ioprio == -1)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#150: FILE: Documentation/block/ionice.c:100:
+		if (ioprio_set(IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS, pid, ioprio | ioprio_class << IOPRIO_CLASS_SHIFT) == -1) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
