WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'register_nodes', this function's name, in a string
#66: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/smp.c:749:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "register_nodes: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#67: FILE: arch/ppc64/kernel/smp.c:750:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "register_nodes: "
+			       "register_node %d failed (%d)", i, ret);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
