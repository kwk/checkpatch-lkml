WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'tempremental' may be misspelled - perhaps 'temperamental'?
#59: 
It's very tempremental.  If there's any (for eg) IDE DMA that occurs
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#94: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/longhaul.c:94:
+static void ide_idle(void)
+ {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
