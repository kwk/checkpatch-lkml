#24: 
We weren't making sure that we initialized the FP registers of new processes

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#72: FILE: arch/um/include/registers.h:17:
+extern void get_safe_registers(unsigned long * regs, unsigned long * fp_regs);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: arch/um/include/registers.h:17:
+extern void get_safe_registers(unsigned long * regs, unsigned long * fp_regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#88: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/sys-x86_64/registers.c:76:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "fp_regs"
#88: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/sys-x86_64/registers.c:76:
+	if(fp_regs != NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

+	if(err < 0)

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'copy_context_skas0', this function's name, in a string
#145: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/skas/process.c:351:
+		panic("copy_context_skas0 : PTRACE_SETFPREGS failed, "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#146: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/skas/process.c:352:
+		panic("copy_context_skas0 : PTRACE_SETFPREGS failed, "
+		      "pid = %d, errno = %d\n", pid, errno);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
