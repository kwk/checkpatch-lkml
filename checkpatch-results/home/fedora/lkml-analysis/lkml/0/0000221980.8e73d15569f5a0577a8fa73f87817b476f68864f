WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#84: FILE: kernel/params.c:370:
+#define to_param_attr(n) container_of(n, struct param_attribute, mattr);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#258: FILE: kernel/params.c:460:
+		struct kernel_param *kp = &kparam[i];
+		if (kp->perm) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#279: FILE: kernel/params.c:472:
+	if ((err = sysfs_create_group(&mk->kobj, &mp->grp))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#317: FILE: kernel/params.c:518:
+		 * attrs at this point.  Deallocate immediately. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
