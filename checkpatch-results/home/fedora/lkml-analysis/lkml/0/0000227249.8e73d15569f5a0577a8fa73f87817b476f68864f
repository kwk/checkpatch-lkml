ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#71: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:76:
+extern int teardown_irq(unsigned int irq, struct irqaction * old);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:76:
+extern int teardown_irq(unsigned int irq, struct irqaction * old);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
