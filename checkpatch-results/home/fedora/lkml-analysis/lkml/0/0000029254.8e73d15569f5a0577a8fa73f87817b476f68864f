#29: 
Description: In function usb_se401_remove_disconnected() [drivers/media/video/se401.c], se401->sbuf[i].data was freed only when se401->urb[i] existed. This could result in a memory leak because sbuf[i].data is allocated before urb[i]. Let's assume that the memory gets exhausted while allocating for urb[i] Now, some event results in calling of usb_se401_remove_disconnected(). This will free sbuf[i].data only for those 'i' for which an urb exists. Since, we could not allocate all urb[i] as memory got exhausted, some of sbuf[i].data would never be freed at all.
