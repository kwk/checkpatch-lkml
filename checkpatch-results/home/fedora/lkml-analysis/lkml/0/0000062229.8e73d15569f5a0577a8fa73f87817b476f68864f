CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*action)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct irqaction)...)
#105: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:432:
+		action = kmalloc(sizeof(struct irqaction), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
