Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 131 exceeds 100 columns
#48: FILE: drivers/net/tulip/eeprom.c:240:
+				   ((leaf->type < sizeof(block_name)/sizeof(block_name[0])) ? block_name[leaf->type] : "unknown"), 

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:ARRAY_SIZE: Prefer ARRAY_SIZE(block_name)
#48: FILE: drivers/net/tulip/eeprom.c:240:
+				   ((leaf->type < sizeof(block_name)/sizeof(block_name[0])) ? block_name[leaf->type] : "unknown"), 

The ARRAY_SIZE(foo) macro should be preferred over
sizeof(foo)/sizeof(foo[0]) for finding number of elements in an
array.

The macro is defined in include/linux/kernel.h::

  #define ARRAY_SIZE(x) (sizeof(x) / sizeof((x)[0]))

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#48: FILE: drivers/net/tulip/eeprom.c:240:
+				   ((leaf->type < sizeof(block_name)/sizeof(block_name[0])) ? block_name[leaf->type] : "unknown"), 
 				                                    ^
