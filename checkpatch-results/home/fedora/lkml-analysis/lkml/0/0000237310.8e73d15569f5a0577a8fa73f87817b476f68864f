WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#119: FILE: kernel/futex.c:550:
+		printk("futex_wait woken: %lu %i %lu\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'futex_wait', this function's name, in a string
#119: FILE: kernel/futex.c:550:
+		printk("futex_wait woken: %lu %i %lu\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
