#24: 
i2c: Removed the name variable from i2c_client as the dev one should be used instead.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#36: 
--- a/drivers/i2c/chips/adm1021.c	Mon Mar 24 17:28:07 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
