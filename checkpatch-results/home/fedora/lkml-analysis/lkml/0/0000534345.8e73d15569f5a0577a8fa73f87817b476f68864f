WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#115: FILE: init/main.c:720:
+extern void initrd_load(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#124: FILE: init/main.c:729:
+	int real_root_mountflags = root_mountflags;
+	if (!initrd_start)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
