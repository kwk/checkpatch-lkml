ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#53: 
--- a/drivers/block/genhd.c	Thu Jan 15 11:05:57 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#59: FILE: drivers/block/genhd.c:227:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(get_gendisk);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#106: FILE: drivers/char/raw.c:143:
+	if (dev && target) {
+		sysfs_create_link(&dev->kobj, target, "device");
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
