#28: 
If you stop process with ^Z, then suspend, process is awakened. Thats
                                                                ^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#57: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:43:
+	/* Hmm, should we be allowed to suspend when there are realtime
+	   processes around? */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
