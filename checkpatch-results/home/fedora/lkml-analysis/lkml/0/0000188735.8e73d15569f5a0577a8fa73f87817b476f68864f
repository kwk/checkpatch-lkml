WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#173: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:139:
+int __devinit register_node(struct node *node, int num, struct node *parent)

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#192: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:167:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(unregister_node);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#211: FILE: include/linux/node.h:30:
+extern void unregister_node(struct node *node);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
