WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ac_read', this function's name, in a string
#41: FILE: drivers/char/applicom.c:602:
+			printk(KERN_DEBUG "Looping in ac_read. loopcount %d\n", loopcount);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
