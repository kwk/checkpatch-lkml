CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#55: FILE: include/linux/vcache.h:21:
+extern void __detach_vcache(vcache_t *vcache);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#67: FILE: kernel/futex.c:118:
+^Iif (likely(page != NULL)) {^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "page"
#67: FILE: kernel/futex.c:118:
+	if (likely(page != NULL)) {	

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
