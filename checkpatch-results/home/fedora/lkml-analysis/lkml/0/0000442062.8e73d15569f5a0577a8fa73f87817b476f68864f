WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'compatabile' may be misspelled - perhaps 'compatible'?
#32: 
goes back to the 2.4 method, which is compatabile with the boot 
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#68: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:149:
+				pte_base = pte = (pte_t *) alloc_bootmem_low_pages(PAGE_SIZE);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#68: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:149:
+				pte_base = pte = (pte_t *) alloc_bootmem_low_pages(PAGE_SIZE);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#75: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:156:
+^I^I^I^I^IBUG();^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#75: FILE: arch/i386/mm/init.c:156:
+					BUG();	

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
