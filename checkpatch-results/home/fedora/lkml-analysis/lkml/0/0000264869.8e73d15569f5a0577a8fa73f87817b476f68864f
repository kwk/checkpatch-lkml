ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['

+nodemask_t pci_bus_to_nodemask [256] = { [0 ... 255] = NODE_MASK_ALL };

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_GET_PCIBUS_NODEMASK' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#180: FILE: include/asm-i386/topology.h:63:
+#define ARCH_HAS_GET_PCIBUS_NODEMASK

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
