ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#135: FILE: drivers/video/console/bitblit.c:203:
+          it's a gain to check buf against NULL even though kfree() handles$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#135: FILE: drivers/video/console/bitblit.c:203:
+       /* buf is always NULL except when in monochrome mode, so in this case
+          it's a gain to check buf against NULL even though kfree() handles

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
