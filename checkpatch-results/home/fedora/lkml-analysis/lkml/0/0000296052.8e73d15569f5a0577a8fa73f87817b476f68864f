WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#66: FILE: sound/drivers/serial-u16550.c:345:
+	if (io_base == 0 || io_base == SNDRV_AUTO_PORT) {
 		return -ENODEV;	/* Not configured */
 	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
