WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated
#55: FILE: jffs2/compr.c:12:
+ * $Id: compr.c,v 1.42 2004/08/07 21:56:08 dwmw2 Exp $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#64: FILE: jffs2/compr.c:184:
+	/* Older code had a bug where it would write non-zero 'usercompr'
+	   fields. Deal with it. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
