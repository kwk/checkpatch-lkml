ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#100: FILE: drivers/pcmcia/ds.c:416:
+struct proc_dir_entry *proc_pccard = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
