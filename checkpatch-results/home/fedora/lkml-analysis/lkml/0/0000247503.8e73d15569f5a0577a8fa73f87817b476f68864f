Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!node"
#68: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:137:
+	if (node == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#69: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:138:
+		printk("unregister_node: node is null.");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'unregister_node', this function's name, in a string
#69: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:138:
+		printk("unregister_node: node is null.");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#85: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:154:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(register_node);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#86: FILE: drivers/base/node.c:155:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(unregister_node);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#94: FILE: include/linux/node.h:30:
+extern void  unregister_node(struct node *node, struct node *parent);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
