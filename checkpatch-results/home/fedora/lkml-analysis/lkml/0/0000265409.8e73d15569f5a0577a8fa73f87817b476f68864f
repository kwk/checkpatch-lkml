I strongly beleive, it is correct. You can get ugly user-space
           ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

#42: 
I think, prio_tree vm_set managment can be simplified.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
