ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#48: FILE: kernel/sched.c:505:
+^I       ^Ielse$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#49: FILE: kernel/sched.c:506:
+			if (unlikely(kick) && task_running(rq, p) && (p->thread_info->cpu != smp_processor_id()))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p->thread_info->cpu != smp_processor_id()'
#49: FILE: kernel/sched.c:506:
+			if (unlikely(kick) && task_running(rq, p) && (p->thread_info->cpu != smp_processor_id()))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
