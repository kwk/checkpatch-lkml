#50: 
Implement card lock/unlock card operation, using the MMC_LOCK_UNLOCK command.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#168: FILE: drivers/mmc/mmc.c:1181:
+        memset(&cmd, 0, sizeof(struct mmc_command));$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#168: FILE: drivers/mmc/mmc.c:1181:

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#179: FILE: drivers/mmc/mmc.c:1192:
+		 * the status register, hiding the error condition */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#207: FILE: drivers/mmc/mmc.c:1220:

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'c' - possible side-effects?
#221: FILE: include/linux/mmc/card.h:75:
+#define mmc_card_lockable(c)   (((c)->csd.cmdclass & CCC_LOCK_CARD) && (c)->host->pwd_support)

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#231: FILE: include/linux/mmc/card.h:114:
+extern int mmc_lock_unlock(struct mmc_card *card, struct key *key, int mode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
