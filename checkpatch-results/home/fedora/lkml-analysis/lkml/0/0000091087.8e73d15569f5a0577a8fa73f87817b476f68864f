+	This is a low-level driver for PathScale InfiniPath host channel
+	adapters (HCAs) based on the HT-400 and PE-800 chips, including
+	the InfiniPath HT-460, the small form factor InfiniPath HT-460,

+config INFINIBAND_IPATH
+	tristate "PathScale InfiniPath Verbs Driver"
+	depends on IPATH_CORE && INFINIBAND
+	---help---
+	This is a driver that provides InfiniBand verbs support for
+	PathScale InfiniPath host channel adapters (HCAs).  This
+	allows these devices to be used with both kernel upper level
+	protocols such as IP-over-InfiniBand as well as with userspace
+	applications (in conjunction with InfiniBand userspace access).

WARNING:DEPRECATED_VARIABLE: Use of EXTRA_CFLAGS is deprecated, please use `ccflags-y instead.
#93: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/Makefile:1:
+EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DIPATH_IDSTR='"PathScale kernel.org driver"' \

EXTRA_{A,C,CPP,LD}FLAGS are deprecated and should be replaced by the new
flags added via commit f77bf01425b1 ("kbuild: introduce ccflags-y,
asflags-y and ldflags-y").

The following conversion scheme maybe used::

  EXTRA_AFLAGS    ->  asflags-y
  EXTRA_CFLAGS    ->  ccflags-y
  EXTRA_CPPFLAGS  ->  cppflags-y
  EXTRA_LDFLAGS   ->  ldflags-y
