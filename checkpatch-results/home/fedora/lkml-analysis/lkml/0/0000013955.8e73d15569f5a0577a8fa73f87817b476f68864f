WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#168: FILE: fs/gfs2/inode.c:153:
+struct inode *gfs2_inode_lookup(struct super_block *sb, struct gfs2_inum_host *inum, unsigned int type)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
