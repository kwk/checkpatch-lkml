ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#216: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:401:
+	struct vm_area_struct * vma;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#225: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:403:
+	size = resident = shared = text = lib = data = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#251: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:412:
+		int pages = (vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
+		size += pages;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
