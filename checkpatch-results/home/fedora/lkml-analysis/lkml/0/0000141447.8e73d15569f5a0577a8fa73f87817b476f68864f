WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct tpm_chip *' should also have an identifier name
#53: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.h:58:
+	u8 (*status) (struct tpm_chip *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS: Consider renaming function(s) 'tpm_show_pubek' to 'pubek_show'
#110: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_infineon.c:322:
+}

The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
<attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.

Consider the following examples::

  static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
  static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);

The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.
