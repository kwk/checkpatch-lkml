WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#123: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/setup.c:1144:
+struct seq_operations cpuinfo_op = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
