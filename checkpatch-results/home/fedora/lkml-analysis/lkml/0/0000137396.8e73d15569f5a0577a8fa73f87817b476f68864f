#31: 
During this work I found a bug in the change_page_attr() code on x86-64, and

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'eventhough' may be misspelled - perhaps 'even though'?
#38: 
eventhough the individual pte entries for the 4Kb pages would not. This
^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#67: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/pageattr.c:149:
+			ref_prot2 = __pgprot(pgprot_val(pte_pgprot(*lookup_address(address))) & ~(1<<_PAGE_BIT_PSE));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+			struct page *split;
+			ref_prot2 = __pgprot(pgprot_val(pte_pgprot(*lookup_address(address))) & ~(1<<_PAGE_BIT_PSE));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
