CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#60: FILE: fs/ramfs/inode.c:140:
+			dir->i_mtime = dir->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
