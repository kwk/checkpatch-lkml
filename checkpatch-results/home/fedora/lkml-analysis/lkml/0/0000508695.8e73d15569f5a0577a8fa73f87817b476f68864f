ERROR:MODIFIED_INCLUDE_ASM: do not modify files in include/asm, change architecture specific files in include/asm-<architecture>
#44: +++ linux/include/asm/keyboard.h	Sun Oct  7 16:37:45 2001

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#58: FILE: include/asm/keyboard.h:32:
+extern int pckbd_pm_resume(struct pm_dev *, pm_request_t, void *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pm_dev *' should also have an identifier name
#58: FILE: include/asm/keyboard.h:32:
+extern int pckbd_pm_resume(struct pm_dev *, pm_request_t, void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'pm_request_t' should also have an identifier name

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
