infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#39: 
--- a/Documentation/DocBook/Makefile	Tue Oct  8 15:51:08 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
