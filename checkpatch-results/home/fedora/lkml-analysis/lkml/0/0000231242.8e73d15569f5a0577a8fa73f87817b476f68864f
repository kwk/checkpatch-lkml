WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'gurantees' may be misspelled - perhaps 'guarantees'?
#29: 
 - arm gurantees irqs are disabled when calling irq_exit so it can call
       ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of '__ARCH_HAS_DO_SOFTIRQ' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#244: FILE: include/asm-s390/hardirq.h:40:
+#define __ARCH_HAS_DO_SOFTIRQ

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.
