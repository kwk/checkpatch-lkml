CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#86: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:482:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#251: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:847:
+	BUG_ON(prio >= CFQ_PRIO_LISTS);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#316: FILE: block/cfq-iosched.c:982:
+	return base_slice + (base_slice/CFQ_SLICE_SCALE * (4 - cfqq->ioprio));
 	                               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
