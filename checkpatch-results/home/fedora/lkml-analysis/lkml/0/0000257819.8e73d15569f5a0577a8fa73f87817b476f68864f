CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#112: FILE: fs/ntfs/attrib.h:78:
+extern int ntfs_map_runlist(ntfs_inode *ni, VCN vcn);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#135: FILE: fs/ntfs/compress.c:924:
+	ntfs_error(vol->sb, "ntfs_map_runlist() failed. Cannot read "
+			"compression block.");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
