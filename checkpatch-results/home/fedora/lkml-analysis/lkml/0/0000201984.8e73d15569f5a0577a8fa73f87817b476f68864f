ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#93: FILE: include/linux/module.h:203:
+        __EXPORT_SYMBOL_WARN^I^I^I^I^I\$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#101: FILE: include/linux/module.h:211:
+#define __EXPORT_SYMBOL_WARN DO_NOT_USE_EXPORT_SYMBOL_IN_LIBRARY_FILES;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
