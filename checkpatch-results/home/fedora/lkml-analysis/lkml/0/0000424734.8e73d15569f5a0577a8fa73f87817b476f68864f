WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#26: 
# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#40: 
--- a/fs/namei.c	Wed Oct  9 23:53:59 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#83: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:113:
+#define MS_POSIXACL	(1<<16)	/* VFS does not apply the umask */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
