CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'temp > SHARPSL_CHARGE_ON_ACIN_HIGH'

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 149 exceeds 100 columns
#261: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/sharpsl_pm.c:742:
+	dev_dbg(sharpsl_pm.dev, "sharpsl_fatal_check: acin: %d, discharge voltage: %d, no discharge: %d\n", acin, temp, sharpsl_read_main_battery());

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'sharpsl_fatal_check', this function's name, in a string
#261: FILE: arch/arm/mach-pxa/sharpsl_pm.c:742:
+	dev_dbg(sharpsl_pm.dev, "sharpsl_fatal_check: acin: %d, discharge voltage: %d, no discharge: %d\n", acin, temp, sharpsl_read_main_battery());

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
