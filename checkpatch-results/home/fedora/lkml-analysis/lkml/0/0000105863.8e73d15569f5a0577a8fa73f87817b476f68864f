#34: 
new node addtion for x86_64. This is just to reference. :-P
         ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#67: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/init.c:508:
+		node = 0; /* pxm is undefined in DSDT.
+			     This might be non NUMA case */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
