Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#47: 
--- a/drivers/video/console/fbcon.c	Mon May 12 16:38:57 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#74: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:999:
+			cursor.hot.x = cursor.hot.y = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.h:41:
+extern int set_con2fb_map(int unit, int newidx);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
