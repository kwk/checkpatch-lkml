CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#60: FILE: drivers/base/dd.c:243:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#95: FILE: drivers/base/base.h:19:
+extern void bus_attach_device(struct device * dev);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: drivers/base/base.h:19:
+extern void bus_attach_device(struct device * dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
