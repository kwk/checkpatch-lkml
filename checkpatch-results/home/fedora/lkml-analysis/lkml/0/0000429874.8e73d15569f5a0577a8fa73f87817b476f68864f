WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#45: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1507:
+	BUG_ON(in_interrupt());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:YIELD: Using yield() is generally wrong. See yield() kernel-doc (sched/core.c)
#53: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1515:

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#56: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1518:

WARNING:YIELD: Using yield() is generally wrong. See yield() kernel-doc (sched/core.c)

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#82: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1544:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
