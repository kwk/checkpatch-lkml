ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#38: 
--- a/drivers/char/tty_io.c	Wed Apr 16 23:40:27 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#71: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1721:
+		set = clear = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)
#85: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1735:
+		set &= TIOCM_DTR|TIOCM_RTS|TIOCM_OUT1|TIOCM_OUT2;
 		                ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "priv->tty->driver.tiocmset"
#156: FILE: drivers/net/irda/irtty-sir.c:204:
+	ASSERT(priv->tty->driver.tiocmset != NULL, return -1;);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
