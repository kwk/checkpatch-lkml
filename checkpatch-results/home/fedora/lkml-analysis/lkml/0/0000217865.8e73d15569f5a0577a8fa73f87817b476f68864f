WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#74: FILE: kernel/sched.c:4006:
+	BUG_ON(cpu_online(smp_processor_id()));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#91: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:760:
+extern void idle_task_exit(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
