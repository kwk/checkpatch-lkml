WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#53: FILE: drivers/char/cs5535_gpio.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#54: FILE: drivers/char/cs5535_gpio.c:2:
+ * linux/drivers/char/cs5535_gpio.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/uaccess.h> instead of <asm/uaccess.h>
#76: FILE: drivers/char/cs5535_gpio.c:24:

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#79: FILE: drivers/char/cs5535_gpio.c:27:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#86: FILE: drivers/char/cs5535_gpio.c:34:
+static int major = 0;		/* default to dynamic major */

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#91: FILE: drivers/char/cs5535_gpio.c:39:
+extern u32 cs5535_gpio_base;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#109: FILE: drivers/char/cs5535_gpio.c:57:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

#187: FILE: drivers/char/cs5535_gpio.c:135:
+	if ((i == ARRAY_SIZE(rm)) && (count < len)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#207: FILE: drivers/char/cs5535_gpio.c:155:
+static struct file_operations cs5535_gpio_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
