CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!page->mapping"
#33: FILE: arch/ia64/mm/hugetlbpage.c:376:
+	if (page->mapping == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#34: FILE: arch/ia64/mm/hugetlbpage.c:377:
+		BUG_ON(! PageAgain(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
