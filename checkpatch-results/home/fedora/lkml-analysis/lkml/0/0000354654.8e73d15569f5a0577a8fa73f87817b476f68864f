ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#63: FILE: arch/i386/pci/visws.c:16:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pci_raw_ops should normally be const
#67: FILE: arch/i386/pci/visws.c:18:
+extern struct pci_raw_ops pci_direct_conf1;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
