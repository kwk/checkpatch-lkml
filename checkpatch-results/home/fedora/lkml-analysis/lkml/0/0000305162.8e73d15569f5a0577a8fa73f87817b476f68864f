CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vt"
#71: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:1898:
+	if (vt == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#72: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:1899:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "vt: argh, driver_data is NULL !\n");

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#93: FILE: drivers/char/vt.c:1921:
 	if (from_user) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
