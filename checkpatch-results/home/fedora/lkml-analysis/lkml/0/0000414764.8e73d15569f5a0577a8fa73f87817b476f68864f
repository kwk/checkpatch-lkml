WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated
#32: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/longhaul.c:2:
+ *  $Id: longhaul.c,v 1.77 2002/10/31 21:17:40 db Exp $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#41: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/longhaul.c:439:
+		   Assume min=3.0x & max = whatever we booted at. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#44: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/longhaul.c:442:
+		minfsb = maxfsb = current_fsb;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
