Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#353: FILE: fs/vfat/namei.c:213:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#380: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs.h:335:
+extern int fat_get_dotdot_entry(struct inode *dir, struct buffer_head **bh,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
