This patch fixes vectored write support on fat to do the nessecary
                                                         ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

non-standard action done in write() aswell.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#58: FILE: fs/fat/file.c:23:
+		inode->i_mtime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME_SEC;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#65: FILE: fs/fat/file.c:30:
+static ssize_t fat_file_writev(struct file *filp, const struct iovec *iov,
                                             ^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#72: FILE: fs/fat/file.c:36:
