WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#46: FILE: kernel/power/smp.c:51:
+	printk("Freezing CPUs (at %d)", _smp_processor_id());

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#51: FILE: kernel/power/smp.c:55:
+	BUG_ON(_smp_processor_id() != 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
