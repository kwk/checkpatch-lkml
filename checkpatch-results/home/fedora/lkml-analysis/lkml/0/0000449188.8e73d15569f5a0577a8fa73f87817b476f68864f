CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mapping"
#72: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2519:
+	if (mapping == NULL) {		/* swapped-in anon page */

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#93: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2544:
+			struct buffer_head *next = bh->b_this_page;
+			free_buffer_head(bh);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
