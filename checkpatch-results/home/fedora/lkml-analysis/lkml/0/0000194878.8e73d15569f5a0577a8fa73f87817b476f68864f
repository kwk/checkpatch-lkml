ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#52: FILE: include/asm-ppc/macio.h:129:
+	int	(*suspend)(struct macio_dev* dev, pm_message_t state);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#135: FILE: drivers/video/aty/radeonfb.h:611:
+extern int radeonfb_pci_suspend(struct pci_dev *pdev, pm_message_t state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
