CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1226:
+			p->time_slice = time_slice = task_timeslice(p);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'currrently' may be misspelled - perhaps 'currently'?
#138: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1769:
