CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "c"
#66: FILE: kernel/printk.c:692:
+	for (c = console_drivers; c != NULL; c = c->next) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: include/linux/console.h:107:
+extern struct tty_driver *console_device(int *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int *' should also have an identifier name
#87: FILE: include/linux/console.h:107:
+extern struct tty_driver *console_device(int *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
