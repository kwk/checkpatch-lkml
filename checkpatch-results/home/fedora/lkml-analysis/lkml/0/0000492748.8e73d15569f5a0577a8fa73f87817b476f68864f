+inline static int scsi_merge_requests_fn(request_queue_t * q,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#315: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_merge.c:380:
+inline static int scsi_merge_requests_fn(request_queue_t * q,

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
