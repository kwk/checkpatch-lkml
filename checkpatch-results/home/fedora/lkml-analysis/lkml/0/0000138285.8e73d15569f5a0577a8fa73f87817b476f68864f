CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#80: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:29:
+extern void cpuset_synchronous_page_reclaim_bump(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'occuring' may be misspelled - perhaps 'occurring'?
#136: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:904:
+ * Frequency meter - How fast is some event occuring?
                                             ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#281: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1623:
+	if ((err = cpuset_add_file(cs_dentry, &cft_reclaim_rate)) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
