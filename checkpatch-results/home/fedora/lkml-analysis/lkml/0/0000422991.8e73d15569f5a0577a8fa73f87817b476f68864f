Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*sb->s_fs_info)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct cifs_sb_info)...)
#33: FILE: fs/cifs/cifsfs.c:67:
+	sb->s_fs_info = kmalloc(sizeof(struct cifs_sb_info),GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!cifs_sb"
#35: FILE: fs/cifs/cifsfs.c:69:
+	if (cifs_sb == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
