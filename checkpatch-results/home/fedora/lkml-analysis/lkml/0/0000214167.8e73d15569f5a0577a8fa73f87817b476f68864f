kernel/crash.c has been renamed kernel/crash_dump.c to clarify it's purpose.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#91: FILE: arch/i386/mm/highmem.c:92:

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#91: FILE: arch/i386/mm/highmem.c:92:
+	return (void*) vaddr;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#138: FILE: kernel/crash_dump.c:23:
+ssize_t copy_oldmem_page(unsigned long pfn, char *buf,
+				size_t csize, int userbuf)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#151: FILE: kernel/crash_dump.c:36:
+	if (userbuf) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#156: FILE: kernel/crash_dump.c:41:
