WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#77: FILE: drivers/char/Kconfig:732:
+config RTC_HISTOGRAM
+	tristate "Real Time Clock Histogram Support"
+	default y
+	depends on RTC
+	---help---
+	  If you say Y here then the kernel will track the delivery and
+	  wakeup latency of /dev/rtc using tasks and will report a
+	  histogram to the kernel log when the application closes /dev/rtc.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
