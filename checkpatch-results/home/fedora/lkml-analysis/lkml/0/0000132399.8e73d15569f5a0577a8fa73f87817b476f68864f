#30: 
    Signed-off-by: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#215: FILE: scripts/lxdialog/util.c:187:
+		int tlen = MIN(width - 2, strlen(title));
+		wattrset(dialog, title_attr);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#217: FILE: scripts/lxdialog/util.c:189:
+		mvwaddnstr(dialog, 0, (width - tlen)/2, title, tlen);
 		                                    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
