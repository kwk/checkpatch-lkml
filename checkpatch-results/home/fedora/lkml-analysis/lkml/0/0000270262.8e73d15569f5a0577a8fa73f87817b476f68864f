WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct proto_ops should normally be const
#146: FILE: net/netlink/af_netlink.c:179:
+static struct proto_ops netlink_ops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
