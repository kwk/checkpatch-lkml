WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#102: 
//  EXTRAVERSION = -mm4
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#111: FILE: kernel/rcupdate.c:50:
 struct rcu_ctrlblk rcu_ctrlblk =
+	{ .batch = { .cur = -300, .completed = -300 },

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#402: FILE: include/linux/rcupdate.h:148:
+extern void rcu_restart_cpu(int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
