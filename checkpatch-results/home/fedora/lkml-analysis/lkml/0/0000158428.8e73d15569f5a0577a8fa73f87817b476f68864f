#154: FILE: fs/freevxfs/vxfs_immed.c:41:
+static void *	vxfs_immed_follow_link(struct dentry *, struct nameidata *);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
