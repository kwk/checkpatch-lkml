+	{ PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMD,    PCI_DEVICE_ID_AMD_CS5536_IDE, 	        PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 17 },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
