WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#146: FILE: mm/slab.c:828:
+		 * only use node zero.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#155: FILE: mm/slab.c:837:
+#define next_reap_node(void) do { } while (0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#182: FILE: mm/slab.c:945:
+		struct array_cache *ac = l3->alien[node];
+		if (ac && ac->avail) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
