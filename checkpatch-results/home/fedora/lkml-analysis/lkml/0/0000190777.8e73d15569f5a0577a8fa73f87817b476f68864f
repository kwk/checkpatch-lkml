Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#81: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_priv.h:63:
+extern void scsi_retry_command(struct scsi_cmnd *cmd);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
