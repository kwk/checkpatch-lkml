ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#66: FILE: net/core/dev.c:487:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:INLINE: plain inline is preferred over __inline__

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#282: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2079:
+		next = ((struct net_ns_dev*)v)->list.next;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#292: FILE: net/core/dev.c:2088:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
