CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u64' over 'uint64_t'
#65: FILE: include/asm-generic/div64.h:35:
+extern uint32_t __div64_32(uint64_t *dividend, uint32_t divisor);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/asm-generic/div64.h:35:
+extern uint32_t __div64_32(uint64_t *dividend, uint32_t divisor);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
