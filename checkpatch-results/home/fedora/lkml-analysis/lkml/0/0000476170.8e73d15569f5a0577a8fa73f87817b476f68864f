#27: 
since 2.5.x (can't remember version correctly) the setup for RAM disk changed and I could not build it anymore into the kernel due to compilation errors.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'upto' may be misspelled - perhaps 'up to'?
#28: 
In the latest prepatch (2.5.5-pre1) this is still not fixed. I am using the following patch to fix this and it works from 2.5.x upto 2.5.5-pre1 without any problems.
                                                                                                                                ^^^^

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
