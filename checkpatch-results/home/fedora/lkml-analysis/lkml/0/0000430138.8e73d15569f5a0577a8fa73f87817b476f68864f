CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#59: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:98:
+#define TAINT_FORCED_RMMOD		(1<<3)
                           		  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#59: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:98:
+#define TAINT_FORCED_RMMOD		(1<<3)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#136: FILE: kernel/module.c:261:
+		if (!(forced = try_force(flags)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#143: FILE: kernel/module.c:266:
+		if (!(forced = try_force(flags)))

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#147: FILE: kernel/module.c:270:
+	if (!forced)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#149: FILE: kernel/module.c:272:
