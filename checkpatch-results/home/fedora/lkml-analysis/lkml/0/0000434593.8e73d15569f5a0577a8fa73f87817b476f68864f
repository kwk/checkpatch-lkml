WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#124: FILE: exit.c:456:
+		int ptrace_flag = p->ptrace;
+		BUG_ON (ptrace_flag == 0);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#124: FILE: exit.c:456:
+		BUG_ON (ptrace_flag == 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
