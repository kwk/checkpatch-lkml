CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <__ClearPageReserved>
#138: FILE: bootmem.c:281:
+			__ClearPageReserved(page);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#141: FILE: bootmem.c:284:
+				if (j + 16 < BITS_PER_LONG) {
+					prefetchw(page + j + 16);
+				}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
#146: FILE: bootmem.c:289:
+			__free_pages(page, ffs(BITS_PER_LONG)-1);
 			                                     ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
