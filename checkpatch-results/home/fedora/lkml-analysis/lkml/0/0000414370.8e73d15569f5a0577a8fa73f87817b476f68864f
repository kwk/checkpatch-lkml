#30: 
- move to completely dynamic tsc disabling (eliminate X86_TSC config option)

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#43: 
--- a/arch/i386/Kconfig	Tue Nov 12 16:36:44 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

+	  Voyager is a MCA based 32 way capable SMP architecture proprietary
+	  to NCR Corp.  Machine classes 345x/35xx/4100/51xx are voyager based.
+	  
+	  *** WARNING ***

+	  If you do not specifically know you have a Voyager based machine,
+	  say N here otherwise the kernel you build will not be bootable.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

#543: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_pit.c:12:
+#include <asm/smp.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#569: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_tsc.c:295:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/

may be added while invoking checkpatch.
