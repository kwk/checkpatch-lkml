The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#146: FILE: kernel/futex.c:133:
+	BUG_ON(list_empty(&q->list));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#397: FILE: mm/vcache.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#413: FILE: mm/vcache.c:18:
+#define VCACHE_HASHSIZE (1 << VCACHE_HASHBITS)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
