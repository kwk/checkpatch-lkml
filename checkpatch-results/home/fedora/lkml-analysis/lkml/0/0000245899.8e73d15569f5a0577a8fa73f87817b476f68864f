CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#149: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi.c:267:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#160: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi.c:287:
+	struct Scsi_Host *shost = sdev->host;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
