Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#293: FILE: mm/mmap.c:66:
+int mmap_use_hugepages = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#310: FILE: mm/mmap.c:483:
+static inline unsigned long __do_mmap_pgoff(struct file * file, unsigned long addr,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#430: FILE: mm/mmap.c:765:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
