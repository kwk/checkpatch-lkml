#46: 
My final patch is below. but I attach this just for sharing not for upstream.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#118: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1484:
+                   so check spanned_pages instead of present_pages */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#118: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1484:
+		/* When hot-add, present page is 0 at this point.
+                   so check spanned_pages instead of present_pages */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#128: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1958:
+void zone_wait_table_init(struct zone *zone,
+			  unsigned long zone_size_pages, int hotadd)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'zone_size_pages == PAGES_PER_SECTION'
#139: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1968:
+	if (hotadd && (zone_size_pages == PAGES_PER_SECTION))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
