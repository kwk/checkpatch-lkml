Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#164: FILE: ulib/kso_init.c:1:
+/* kso_init.c - libredhat-kernel.so startup code.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#165: FILE: ulib/kso_init.c:2:
+/* kso_init.c - libredhat-kernel.so startup code.
+

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - int main() should probably be int main(void)
#260: FILE: ulib/myln.c:7:
+int main ()

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#260: FILE: ulib/myln.c:7:
+int main ()

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#263: FILE: ulib/myln.c:10:
+	long ctx = 0;
+	extern long vsys_io_setup(long, long *);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#263: FILE: ulib/myln.c:10:
+	extern long vsys_io_setup(long, long *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'long' should also have an identifier name
#263: FILE: ulib/myln.c:10:
+	extern long vsys_io_setup(long, long *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'long *' should also have an identifier name
#263: FILE: ulib/myln.c:10:
+	extern long vsys_io_setup(long, long *);

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#264: FILE: ulib/myln.c:11:
+	unsigned char *bob = (void*)&vsys_io_setup;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
