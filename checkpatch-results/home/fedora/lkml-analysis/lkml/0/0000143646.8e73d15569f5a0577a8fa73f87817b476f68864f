Sure, here is an still untested hack. Sorry, I'm "busy" at a conference this

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tmp"
#85: FILE: libsysfs/sysfs_class.c:249:
+			if (tmp == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dir3"
#146: FILE: udevstart.c:324:
+					if (dir3 != NULL) {

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns
#149: FILE: udevstart.c:327:
+						for (dent3 = readdir(dir3); dent3 != NULL; dent3 = readdir(dir3)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#149: FILE: udevstart.c:327:
+						for (dent3 = readdir(dir3); dent3 != NULL; dent3 = readdir(dir3)) {

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
