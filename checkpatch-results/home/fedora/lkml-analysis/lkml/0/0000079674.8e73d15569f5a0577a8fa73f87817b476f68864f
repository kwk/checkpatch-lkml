+	---help---
+	  This driver provides kernel-side support for the Random
+	  Number Generator hardware found on the Intel IXP4xx NPU.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called ixp4xx-rng.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
