The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#71: FILE: arch/i386/mach-generic/topology.c:2:
+ * arch/i386/mach-generic/topology.c - Populate driverfs with topology information

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#92: FILE: arch/i386/mach-generic/topology.c:23:
+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
