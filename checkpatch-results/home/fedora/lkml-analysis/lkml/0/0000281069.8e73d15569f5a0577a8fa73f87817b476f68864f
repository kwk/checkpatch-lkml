WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#57: FILE: include/asm-i386/bug.h:13:
+#define BUG()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#78: FILE: init/Kconfig:277:
+config BUG
+ 	depends X86
+ 	default y
+	bool "Enable BUG and WARN code" if EMBEDDED
+	help
+	  Disabling this completely removes BUG and WARN checking
+          code. Warning: this may result in data loss if a bug goes
+          undetected.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
