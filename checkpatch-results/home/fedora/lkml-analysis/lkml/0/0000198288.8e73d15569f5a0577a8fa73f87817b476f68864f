ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#44: FILE: arch/i386/pci/common.c:28:
+unsigned long pirq_table_addr = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#53: FILE: arch/i386/pci/common.c:193:
+		pirq_table_addr = simple_strtol(str+9, NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#106: FILE: arch/i386/pci/irq.c:100:
+		if (rt) {
+			return rt;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
