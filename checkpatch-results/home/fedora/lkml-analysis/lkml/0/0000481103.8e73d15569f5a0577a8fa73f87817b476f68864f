Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'reiserfs_free_block', this function's name, in a string
#184: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:107:
+	  reiserfs_warning ("vs-4075: reiserfs_free_block: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#185: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:108:
+^I^I^I    "block %lu is out of range on %s\n", $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
