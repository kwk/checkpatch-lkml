WARNING:YIELD: Using yield() is generally wrong. See yield() kernel-doc (sched/core.c)
#50: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:229:
+		yield();			/* Yield is okay here */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#69: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:483:
+	BUG_ON (max_pfn != num_physpages);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#69: FILE: kernel/suspend.c:483:
+	BUG_ON (max_pfn != num_physpages);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
