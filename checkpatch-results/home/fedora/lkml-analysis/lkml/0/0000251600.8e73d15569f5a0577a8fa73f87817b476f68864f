+	---help---
+        The Cyclades-PC400 is a digital PCI adapter that turns a PC server
+        into a digital Remote Access Server. It connects to 1 or 2 T1/E1/PRI 
+        trunks and has built-in digital modems and DSU/CSUs.
+        System Integrators and Internet Service Providers can use the PC400 
+        to build RAS solutions taking advantage of commodity hardware 
+        and Open Source software.
