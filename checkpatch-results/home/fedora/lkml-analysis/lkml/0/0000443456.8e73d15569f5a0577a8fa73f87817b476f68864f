ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#40: 
--- a/include/linux/slab.h	Mon Jul 15 16:39:25 2002

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#46: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:60:
+extern unsigned int kmem_cache_size(kmem_cache_t *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'kmem_cache_t *' should also have an identifier name
#46: FILE: include/linux/slab.h:60:
+extern unsigned int kmem_cache_size(kmem_cache_t *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#70: FILE: mm/slab.c:1644:
+		return (cachep->objsize - 2*BYTES_PER_WORD);
 		                           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
