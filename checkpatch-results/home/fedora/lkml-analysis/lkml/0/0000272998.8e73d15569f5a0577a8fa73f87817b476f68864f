ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#55: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:49:
+			if ((inode = sysfs_new_inode(mode))) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#55: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:49:
+			if ((inode = sysfs_new_inode(mode))) {
[...]
 			else 
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#58: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:52:
+					struct inode *p_inode = dentry->d_parent->d_inode;
+					p_inode->i_mtime = p_inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#58: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:52:
+					p_inode->i_mtime = p_inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
