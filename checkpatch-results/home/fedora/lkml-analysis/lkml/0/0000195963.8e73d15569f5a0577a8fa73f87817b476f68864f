CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#114: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:295:
+	sreq->sr_result = cmd.result = DID_NO_CONNECT << 16;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
