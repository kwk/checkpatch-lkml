Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#74: FILE: fs/ext3/symlink.c:29:
+	nd_set_link(nd, (char*)ei->i_data);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
