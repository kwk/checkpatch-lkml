#33: 
Haven't seen this one yet, but we have an assortment of strange bugs on 2.6.16-rc1-git.  What were you doing to trigger it?

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#44: 
--- a/drivers/char/Kconfig	Tue Jan 24 15:03:39 2006 -0500

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
