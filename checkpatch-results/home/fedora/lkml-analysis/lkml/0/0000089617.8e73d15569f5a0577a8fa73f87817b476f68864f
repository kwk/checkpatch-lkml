+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#96: FILE: drivers/leds/ledtrig-ide-disk.c:40:
+^I    ^Imod_timer(&ledtrig_ide_timer, jiffies + msecs_to_jiffies(10));$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#130: FILE: include/linux/leds.h:104:
+extern void ledtrig_ide_activity(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#132: FILE: include/linux/leds.h:106:
+#define ledtrig_ide_activity() do {} while(0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#144: FILE: drivers/leds/Kconfig:69:
+config LEDS_TRIGGER_IDE_DISK
+	bool "LED Timer Trigger"
+	depends LEDS_TRIGGERS && BLK_DEV_IDEDISK

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
