CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <SCx200_GPIO_SIZE>
#39: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/scx200.c:51:
+	if (request_region(base, SCx200_GPIO_SIZE, "NatSemi SCx200 GPIO") == NULL) {

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!request_region"
#39: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/scx200.c:51:
+	if (request_region(base, SCx200_GPIO_SIZE, "NatSemi SCx200 GPIO") == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
