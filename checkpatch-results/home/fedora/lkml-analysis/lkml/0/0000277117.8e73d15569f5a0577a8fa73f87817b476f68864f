ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#87: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.c:127:
+struct ipmi_proc_entry
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

+	/* A list of proc entries for this interface.  This does not

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
