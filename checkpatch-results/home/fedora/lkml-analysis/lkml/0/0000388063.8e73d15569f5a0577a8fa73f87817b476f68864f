Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#74: FILE: fs/nfs/nfsroot.c:117:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(root_server_path);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#199: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:1389:
+char *ip = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#211: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:1401:
+	if (ip != NULL) {
+		ip_auto_config_setup(ip);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ip"
#211: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:1401:
+	if (ip != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
