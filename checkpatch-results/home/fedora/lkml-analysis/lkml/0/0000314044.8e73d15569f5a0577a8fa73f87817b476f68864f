WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#74: FILE: include/linux/kthread.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_KTHREAD_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#89: FILE: include/linux/kthread.h:16:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#117: FILE: include/linux/kthread.h:44:
+ * kthread_start().  Returns the kthread, or ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM). */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#121: FILE: include/linux/kthread.h:48:
+	struct task_struct *__k						   \
+		= kthread_create(threadfn, data, namefmt, ## __VA_ARGS__); \

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#148: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:63:
+extern int keventd_up(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#313: FILE: kernel/kthread.c:145:
+	if (!keventd_up())

[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "keventd_wq"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
