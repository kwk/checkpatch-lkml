Doesnt read_cache_page lock the page already?
^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'cramfs_read_getpage', this function's name, in a string
#149: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:167:
+	printk("cramfs_read_getpage %d %p\n", 5 - readagain + 1, page);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#165: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:181:
+	unsigned i, blocknr, buffer;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#218: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:216:
+			if (page) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#235: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:510:
+	int ret = -ENOENT;
+	if (page)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
