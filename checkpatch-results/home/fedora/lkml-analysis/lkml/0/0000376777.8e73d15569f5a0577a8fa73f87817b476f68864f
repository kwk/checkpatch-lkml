Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*new_ns)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct namespace)...)
#54: FILE: fs/namespace.c:785:
+	new_ns = kmalloc(sizeof(struct namespace), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
