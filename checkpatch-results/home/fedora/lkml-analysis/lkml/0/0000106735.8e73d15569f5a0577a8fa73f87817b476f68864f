CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#52: FILE: drivers/input/joystick/sidewinder.c:739:
+		sw->dev[i] = input_dev = input_allocate_device();

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
