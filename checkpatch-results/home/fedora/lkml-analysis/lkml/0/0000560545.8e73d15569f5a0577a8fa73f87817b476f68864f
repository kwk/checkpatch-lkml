WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#12: 
Subject: Sparse cores for 2.2

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#40: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1059:
+	if ((size += (nr)) > limit || !dump_write(file, (addr), (nr))) \

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "vma"
#86: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1283:
+	for(vma = current->mm->mmap; vma != NULL; vma = vma->vm_next) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

#104: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1312:

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#123: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1329:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#131: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1337:
+				DUMP_SEEK (file->f_pos + PAGE_SIZE);

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#133: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1339:
+				DUMP_WRITE((void*)addr, PAGE_SIZE);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
