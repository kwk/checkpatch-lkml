CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#61: FILE: arch/ppc/platforms/4xx/walnut.c:47:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#77: FILE: arch/ppc/platforms/4xx/walnut.c:63:
+	printk("walnut_kick_cpu(): CPU released, waiting\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'walnut_kick_cpu', this function's name, in a string
#77: FILE: arch/ppc/platforms/4xx/walnut.c:63:
+	printk("walnut_kick_cpu(): CPU released, waiting\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
