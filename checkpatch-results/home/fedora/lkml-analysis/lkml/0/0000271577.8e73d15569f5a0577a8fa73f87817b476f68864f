CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!skb"
#129: FILE: net/sched/sch_delay.c:148:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
