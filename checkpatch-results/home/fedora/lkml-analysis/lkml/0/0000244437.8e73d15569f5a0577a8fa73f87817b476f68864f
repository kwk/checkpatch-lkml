Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#78: FILE: kernel/sched.c:188:
+#define task_hot(p, now, sd) ((long long) ((now) - (p)->last_ran)	\

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

 }
+#define task_hot(p, now, sd) ((long long) ((now) - (p)->last_ran)	\

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#79: FILE: kernel/sched.c:189:
+				< (long long) (sd)->cache_hot_time)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#88: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2837:
+	prev->timestamp = prev->last_ran = now;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
