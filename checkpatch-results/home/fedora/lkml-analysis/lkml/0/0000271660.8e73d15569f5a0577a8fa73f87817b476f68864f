Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#73: FILE: drivers/base/driver.c:123:
+	struct kobject *k = kset_find_obj(&bus->drivers, name);
+	if (k)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#94: FILE: include/linux/device.h:123:
+extern struct device_driver *driver_find(const char *name, struct bus_type *bus);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
