                            ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#79: FILE: kernel/ksyms.c:608:
+int pc98 = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#96: FILE: kernel/timer.c:440:
+extern unsigned long tick_usec; ^I^I/* ACTHZ   period (usec) */$

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#97: FILE: kernel/timer.c:441:
+extern unsigned long tick_nsec;			/* USER_HZ period (nsec) */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
