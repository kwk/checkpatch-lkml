CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*fsec)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct file_security_struct)...)
#51: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:194:
+	fsec = kzalloc(sizeof(struct file_security_struct), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
