CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*fcs)...) over kmalloc(sizeof (struct ctrl_inquiry)...)
#45: FILE: linux-2.6.6-modified/drivers/scsi/pluto.c:120:
+	fcs = (struct ctrl_inquiry *) kmalloc (sizeof (struct ctrl_inquiry) *

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply

fcscount,

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.
