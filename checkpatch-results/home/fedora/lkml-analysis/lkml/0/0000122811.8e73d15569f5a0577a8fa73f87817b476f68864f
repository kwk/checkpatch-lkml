#27: 
the patch inlined is changing the SPI core and its users to have transfers in the SPI message structure as linked list not as an array, for the reasons discussed recently in this list.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#164: FILE: drivers/mtd/devices/mtd_dataflash.c:165:
+	x.tx_buf = command = priv->command;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
