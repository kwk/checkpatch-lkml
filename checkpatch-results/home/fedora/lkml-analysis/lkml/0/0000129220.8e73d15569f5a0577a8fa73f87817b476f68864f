ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros starting with if should be enclosed by a do - while loop to avoid possible if/else logic defects
#98: FILE: kernel/power/snapshot.c:68:
+#define CACHE(x) \
+		if (sizeof(struct highmem_page) <= x) { \
+			size = x; \
+			goto found; \
+		}

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)
