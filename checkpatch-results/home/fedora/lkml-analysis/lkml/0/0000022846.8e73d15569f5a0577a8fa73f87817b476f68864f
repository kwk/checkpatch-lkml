Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtol is obsolete, use kstrtol instead
#56: FILE: lib/cmdline.c:52:
+		upper_range = simple_strtol((*str), NULL, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
