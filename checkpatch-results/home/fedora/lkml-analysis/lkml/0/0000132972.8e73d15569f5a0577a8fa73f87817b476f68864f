Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LIKELY_MISUSE: nested (un)?likely() calls, IS_ERR already uses unlikely() internally

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#271: FILE: drivers/block/nbd.c:413:
+	BUG_ON(lo->sock);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
