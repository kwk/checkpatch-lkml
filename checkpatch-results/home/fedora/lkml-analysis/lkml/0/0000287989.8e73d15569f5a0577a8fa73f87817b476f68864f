WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#385: FILE: lib/Kconfig.debug:136:
+config KALLSYMS
+	bool "Load all symbols for debugging/kksymoops"
+	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
+	default y if !ARCH_S390
+	help
+	  Say Y here to let the kernel print out symbolic crash information and
+	  symbolic stack backtraces. This increases the size of the kernel
+	  somewhat, as all symbols have to be loaded into the kernel image.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
