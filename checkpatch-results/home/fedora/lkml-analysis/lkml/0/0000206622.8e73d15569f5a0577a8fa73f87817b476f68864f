Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph

So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
