Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#51: FILE: include/linux/mm_page_replace.h:46:
 }
+void page_replace_reinsert(struct zone *, struct list_head *);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#82: FILE: mm/page_replace.c:93:
+		struct page *page = lru_to_page(page_list);
+		BUG_ON(PageLRU(page));

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#82: FILE: mm/page_replace.c:93:
+		BUG_ON(PageLRU(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
