To achive these, negotiate in the INIT request whether async reads

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#94: FILE: fs/fuse/inode.c:478:
+		if (arg->minor >= 6) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#98: FILE: fs/fuse/inode.c:482:
+		} else

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#153: FILE: include/linux/fuse.h:84:
+#define FUSE_ASYNC_READ		(1 << 0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
