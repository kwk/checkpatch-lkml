Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#140: FILE: kerror.c:44:
+	while ((skb = skb_dequeue(&delayed_pkts)) != NULL) {
+		(void) netlink_broadcast(kerror_nl, skb, 0, ~0, GFP_ATOMIC);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

+		(void) netlink_broadcast(kerror_nl, skb, 0, ~0, GFP_ATOMIC);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
