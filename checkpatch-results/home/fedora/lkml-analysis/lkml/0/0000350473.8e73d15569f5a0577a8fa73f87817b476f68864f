Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

+config DECNET
+	tristate "DECnet Support"
+	---help---
+	  The DECnet networking protocol was used in many products made by
+	  Digital (now Compaq).  It provides reliable stream and sequenced
+	  packet communications over which run a variety of services similar
+	  to those which run over TCP/IP.
+
+	  To find some tools to use with the kernel layer support, please
+	  look at Patrick Caulfield's web site:
+	  <http://linux.dreamtime.org/decnet/>.
+
+	  More detailed documentation is available in
+	  <file:Documentation/networking/decnet.txt>.
+
+	  Be sure to say Y to "/proc file system support" and "Sysctl support"
+	  below when using DECnet, since you will need sysctl support to aid
+	  in configuration at run time.
+
+	  The DECnet code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
+	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
+	  The module is called decnet.
+
+source "net/decnet/Kconfig"
+
+config BRIDGE
+	tristate "802.1d Ethernet Bridging"
+	depends on INET
+	---help---
+	  If you say Y here, then your Linux box will be able to act as an
+	  Ethernet bridge, which means that the different Ethernet segments it
+	  is connected to will appear as one Ethernet to the participants.
+	  Several such bridges can work together to create even larger
+	  networks of Ethernets using the IEEE 802.1 spanning tree algorithm.
+	  As this is a standard, Linux bridges will cooperate properly with
+	  other third party bridge products.
+
+	  In order to use the Ethernet bridge, you'll need the bridge
+	  configuration tools; see <file:Documentation/networking/bridge.txt>
+	  for location. Please read the Bridge mini-HOWTO for more
+	  information.
+
+	  If you enable iptables support along with the bridge support then you
+	  turn your bridge into a bridging firewall.
+	  iptables will then see the IP packets being bridged, so you need to
+	  take this into account when setting up your firewall rules.
+
+	  If you want to compile this code as a module ( = code which can be
+	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
+	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
+	  will be called bridge.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#156: FILE: net/Kconfig:174:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

+menuconfig NETFILTER
+	bool "Network packet filtering (replaces ipchains)"
+	---help---
+	  Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets
+	  that pass through your Linux box.
+
+	  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as
+	  a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of
+	  firewall provided by this kernel support is called a "packet
+	  filter", which means that it can reject individual network packets
+	  based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,
+	  a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
+	  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
+	  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
+	  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
+	  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
+	  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
+	  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
+	  you say Y here.
+
+	  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
+	  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
+	  globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
+	  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
+	  the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
+	  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
+	  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
+	  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
+	  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
+	  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
+	  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
+	  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
+	  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
+	  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
+	  called NAT (Network Address Translation).
+
+	  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
+	  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
+	  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
+	  typically a caching proxy server.
+
+	  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
+	  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
+	  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
+	  <file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
+	  these packages.
+
+	  Make sure to say N to "Fast switching" below if you intend to say Y
+	  here, as Fast switching currently bypasses netfilter.
+
+	  Chances are that you should say Y here if you compile a kernel which
+	  will run as a router and N for regular hosts. If unsure, say N.
+
+if NETFILTER
+
+config NETFILTER_DEBUG
+	bool "Network packet filtering debugging"
+	depends on NETFILTER
+	help
+	  You can say Y here if you want to get additional messages useful in
+	  debugging the netfilter code.
