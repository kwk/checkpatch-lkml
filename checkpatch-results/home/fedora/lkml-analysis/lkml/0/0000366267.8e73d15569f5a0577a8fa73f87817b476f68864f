ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#45: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:146:
+	void (*nopagedone)(struct vm_area_struct * area, unsigned long address, int status);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#56: FILE: mm/memory.c:1471:
+	if (vma->vm_ops && vma->vm_ops->nopagedone) {
+		vma->vm_ops->nopagedone(vma, address & PAGE_MASK, ret);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
