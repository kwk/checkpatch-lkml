#33: 
o In case of system crash, current state of cpu registers is saved in memory

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#80: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/crash.c:74:
+	buf = (u32*)per_cpu_ptr(crash_notes, cpu);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
