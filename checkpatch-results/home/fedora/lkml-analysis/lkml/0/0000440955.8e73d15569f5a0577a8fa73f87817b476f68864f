This is how I did it - barring the code that is -ac specific to automatically flip

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#51: FILE: include/asm-i386/processor.h:99:
+extern int dodgy_tsc(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#83: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:1135:
+	if(tsc_disable == 0)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#83: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:1135:
+	if(tsc_disable == 0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#122: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:1173:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
