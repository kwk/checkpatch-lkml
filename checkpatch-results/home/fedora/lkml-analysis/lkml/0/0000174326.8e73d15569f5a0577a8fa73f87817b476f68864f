WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#168: FILE: fs/9p/error.h:82:
+	{"Function not implemented", ENOSYS},

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
