Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
