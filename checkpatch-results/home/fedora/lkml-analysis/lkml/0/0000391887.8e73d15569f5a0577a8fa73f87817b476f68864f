CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'g' - possible side-effects?

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#150: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:645:
+	for ( ; (g = t = next_task(g)) != &init_task ; ) do

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#218: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1174:
+	if (!p) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#219: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1175:
+		g = p = &init_task;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#232: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1187:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
