WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#38: 
situation differs from mm_struct one. Right now we simply rely on mount_sem.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#59: FILE: fs/inode.c:353:
+	struct super_block * sb;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#60: FILE: fs/inode.c:354:
+	struct super_block * sb;
+	spin_lock(&inode_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
