ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#46: FILE: net/ipv4/igmp.c:609:
 	struct flowi fl = { .nl_u = { .ip4_u =
+				      { .daddr = imr->imr_multiaddr.s_addr } } };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
