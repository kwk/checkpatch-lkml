WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#34: 
That's right but sometimes useful, especially when there's no other choice :-)

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#69: 
#### patch 1 : remove the unused mtu[] array

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix '.' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'new_mtu < TULIP_MTU_MIN'
#117: FILE: drivers/net/tulip/tulip_core.c:274:
+	if ((new_mtu < TULIP_MTU_MIN) || (new_mtu > TULIP_MTU_MAX))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
