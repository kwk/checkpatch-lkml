CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#145: FILE: drivers/ide/legacy/pdc4030.c:228:
+	hwif->no_lba48 = hwif2->no_lba48 = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
