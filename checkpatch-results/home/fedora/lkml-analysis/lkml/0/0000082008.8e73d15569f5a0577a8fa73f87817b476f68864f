WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#33: 
Signed-Off-By: KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*res)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct resource)...)
#56: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:197:
+	res = kzalloc(sizeof(struct resource), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#57: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:198:
+	BUG_ON(!res);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#64: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:205:
+		printk("System RAM resource %llx - %llx cannot be added\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#65: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:206:
+		printk("System RAM resource %llx - %llx cannot be added\n",
+		(unsigned long long)res->start, (unsigned long long)res->end);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#70: FILE: mm/memory_hotplug.c:211:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
