Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "strstr"
#47: FILE: drivers/macintosh/therm_adt746x.c:553:
+	if (strstr(np->full_name, "/i2c-bus@") != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#49: FILE: drivers/macintosh/therm_adt746x.c:555:
+		const char *tmp_bus = (strstr(np->full_name, "/i2c-bus@") + 9);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
