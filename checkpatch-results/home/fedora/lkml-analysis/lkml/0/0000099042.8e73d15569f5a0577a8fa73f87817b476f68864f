ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#66: 
--- a/drivers/mmc/mmc_queue.c	Sun Nov  6 22:16:40 2005

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#90: FILE: include/linux/mmc/host.h:88:
+#define MMC_CAP_CLUSTER		(1 << 1)	/* host can support clustered BIOs */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
