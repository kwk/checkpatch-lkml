Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#126: FILE: kernel/power/pmdisk.c:534:
+	pagedir_save = (suspend_pagedir_t *)__get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC | __GFP_COLD | __GFP_NO_COMP, 

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided

+	p = pagedir = (suspend_pagedir_t *)__get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC | __GFP_COLD | __GFP_NO_COMP, pagedir_order);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#195: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:307:
+static void prep_new_page(struct page * _page, int order)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
