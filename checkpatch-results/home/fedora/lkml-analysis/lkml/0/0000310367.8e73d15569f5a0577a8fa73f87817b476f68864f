#27: 
[PATCH] I2C: add I2C_DEBUG_BUS config option and convert the i2c bus drivers to use it.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#68: 
--- a/drivers/i2c/Kconfig	Mon Jan 19 15:27:44 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 114 exceeds 100 columns
#205: FILE: drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-elektor.c:197:
+				pr_debug("i2c-elektor: found cy82c693, config register 0x47 = 0x%02x.\n", config);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
