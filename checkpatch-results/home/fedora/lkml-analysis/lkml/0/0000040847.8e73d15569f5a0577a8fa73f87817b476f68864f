#25: 
The only time it is safe to call aio_complete() is when the ->ki_retry function

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#119: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:285:
+		int ret = dio_complete(dio, dio->iocb->ki_pos, 0);
+		aio_complete(dio->iocb, ret, 0);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#154: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:1077:
+	BUG_ON(ret == -EIOCBQUEUED);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dio->result == dio->size'
#155: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:1078:
+	if (dio->is_async && ret == 0 && dio->result &&
+	    ((rw & READ) || (dio->result == dio->size)))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#172: FILE: fs/direct-io.c:1092:
+	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&dio->refcount)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
