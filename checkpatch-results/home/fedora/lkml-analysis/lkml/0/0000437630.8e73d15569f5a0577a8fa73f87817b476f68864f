ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#31: 
--- a/drivers/char/random.c	2002-08-23 12:43:24.000000000 -0500

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
