CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#68: FILE: kernel/sched.c:234:
+	if (p->flags & PF_PREEMPTED) {
[...]
 	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+	unsigned long total_run = NS_TO_JIFFIES(ns_totalrun);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
