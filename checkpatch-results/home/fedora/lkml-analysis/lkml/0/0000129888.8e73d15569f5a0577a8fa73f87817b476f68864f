ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#44: FILE: mm/slab.c:570:
+	struct page * page = virt_to_page(addr);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#47: FILE: mm/slab.c:573:
+        ^Ipage = (struct page *)page_private(page);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#47: FILE: mm/slab.c:573:
+        ^Ipage = (struct page *)page_private(page);$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#47: FILE: mm/slab.c:573:
+        ^Ipage = (struct page *)page_private(page);$

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#70: FILE: mm/slab.c:607:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#103: FILE: mm/slab.c:1249:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
