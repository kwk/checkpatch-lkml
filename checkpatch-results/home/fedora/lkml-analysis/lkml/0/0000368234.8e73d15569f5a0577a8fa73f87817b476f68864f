The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#230: FILE: include/asm-s390/ctrlchar.h:12:
+extern unsigned int ctrlchar_handle(const unsigned char *buf, int len,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
