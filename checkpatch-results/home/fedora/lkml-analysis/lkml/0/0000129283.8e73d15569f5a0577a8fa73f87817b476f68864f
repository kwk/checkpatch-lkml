WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#83: FILE: parport_plat.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Platfrom' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Platform'?
#84: FILE: parport_plat.c:2:
+ *  parport_plat.c - Platfrom file describing the SPI parport adapter
                      ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#84: FILE: parport_plat.c:2:
+ *  parport_plat.c - Platfrom file describing the SPI parport adapter

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#118: FILE: parport_plat.c:36:
+	if (master)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Registerd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Registered'?

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#126: FILE: parport_plat.c:44:
+       ^I^I^Ireturn -ENODEV;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#126: FILE: parport_plat.c:44:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
