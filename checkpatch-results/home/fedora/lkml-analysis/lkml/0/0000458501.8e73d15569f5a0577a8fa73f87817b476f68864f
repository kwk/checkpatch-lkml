WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#78: FILE: proc/proc_misc.c:242:
+	extern unsigned long total_forks; /*FIXME: move into a .h */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxV)
#89: FILE: proc/proc_misc.c:247:
+		jif=jiffies;
 		   ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: proc/proc_misc.c:248:
+		sum = user = nice = system = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#93: FILE: proc/proc_misc.c:251:
+			int cpu = cpu_logical_map(i), j;
+			user += kstat.per_cpu_user[cpu];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
