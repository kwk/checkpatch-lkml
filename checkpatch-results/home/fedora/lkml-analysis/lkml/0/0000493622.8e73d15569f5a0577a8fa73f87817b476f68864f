WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#101: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:423:
+	extern int broken_hp_bios_irq9;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#102: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:424:
+	extern int broken_hp_bios_irq9;
+	if (broken_hp_bios_irq9 == 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#102: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:424:
+	if (broken_hp_bios_irq9 == 0)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
