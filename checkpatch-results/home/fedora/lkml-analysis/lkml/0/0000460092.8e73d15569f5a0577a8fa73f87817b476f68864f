Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#41: FILE: net/socket.c:1065:
+		if ((unsigned) backlog > sysctl_listen_max)

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#52: FILE: net/core/sysctl_net_core.c:32:
+extern int sysctl_listen_max;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
