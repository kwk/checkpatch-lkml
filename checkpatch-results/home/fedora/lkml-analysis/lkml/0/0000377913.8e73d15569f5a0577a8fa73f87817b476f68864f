#28: 
Following up from http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0304.1/1113.html, here is a prototype patch against 2.5.67 to allow CPUs to be reserved to callers of sys_setaffinity(). It seems to work safely on a uniprocessor, and I'll test it on a multi-processor in a few days time. I'm not requesting inclusion of this patch until then.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#65: FILE: kernel/sched.c:46:
+ */ $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#66: FILE: kernel/sched.c:47:
+unsigned long restricted_cpus = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#87: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2359:
+	temp = simple_strtoul(value, &value, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#93: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2365:
+	if (~temp & cpu_online_map) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#96: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2368:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "cannot restrict all 0x%lx online CPUs!\n", cpu_online_map);
