#### AUTHOR dtor_core@ameritech.net

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#92: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:266:
+int driver_probe_device(struct device_driver * drv, struct device * dev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#108: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:274:

+		if (error) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#182: FILE: include/linux/device.h:328:
+extern int  driver_probe_device(struct device_driver * drv, struct device * dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
