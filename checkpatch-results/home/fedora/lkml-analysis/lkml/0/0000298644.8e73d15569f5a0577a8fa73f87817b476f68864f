ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#53: 
--- a/drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c	2004-03-04 10:24:26.000000000 +0000

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#72: FILE: drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c:946:
+	if (codec->codec_ops->init != NULL) {
+		codec->codec_ops->init(codec);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "codec->codec_ops->init"
#72: FILE: drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c:946:
+	if (codec->codec_ops->init != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#75: FILE: drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c:949:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
