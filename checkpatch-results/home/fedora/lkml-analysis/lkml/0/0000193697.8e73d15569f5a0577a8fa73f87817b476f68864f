WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#77: FILE: include/asm-ppc/raw_spinlock.h:1:
+#ifndef __ASM_RAW_SPINLOCK_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#80: FILE: include/asm-ppc/raw_spinlock.h:4:
+#define ARCH_RAW_RWLOCK_LOCK volatile signed int lock;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
