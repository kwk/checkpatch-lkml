CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:147:
+extern void pidhash_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#84: FILE: kernel/fork.c:55:
+	int i, size = PAGE_SIZE*sizeof(list_t);
 	                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

#95: FILE: kernel/fork.c:66:
