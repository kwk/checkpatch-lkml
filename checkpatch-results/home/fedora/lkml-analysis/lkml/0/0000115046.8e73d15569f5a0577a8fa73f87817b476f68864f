Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

#233: FILE: drivers/media/video/tuner-core.c:94:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
