+static inline void ppc_do_profile (struct pt_regs *regs)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#82: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/time.c:116:
+	extern unsigned long prof_cpu_mask;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#103: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/time.c:166:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#117: FILE: arch/ppc/oprofile/Kconfig:5:
+config PROFILING
+	bool "Profiling support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
+	help
+	  Say Y here to enable the extended profiling support mechanisms used
+	  by profilers such as OProfile.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#153: FILE: arch/ppc/oprofile/init.c:1:
+/**

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo ** bar" should be "foo **bar"
#167: FILE: arch/ppc/oprofile/init.c:15:
+int __init oprofile_arch_init(struct oprofile_operations ** ops)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
