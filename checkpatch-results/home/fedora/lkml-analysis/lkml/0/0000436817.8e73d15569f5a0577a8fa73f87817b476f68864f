Do not use assignments in if condition.

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);

+				cpu_data[i].loops_per_jiffy =3D cpufreq_scale(loops_per_jiffy, freq->c=

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
