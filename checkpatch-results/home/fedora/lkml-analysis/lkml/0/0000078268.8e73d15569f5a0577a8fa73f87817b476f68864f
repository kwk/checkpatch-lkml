WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#36: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/Kconfig:65:
+config HW_RANDOM_IXP4XX
+	tristate "Intel IXP4xx NPU HW Random Number Generator support"
+	depends on HW_RANDOM && ARCH_IXP4XX
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  This driver provides kernel-side support for the Random
+	  Number Generator hardware found on the Intel IXP4xx NPU.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called ixp4xx-rng.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#62: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/ixp4xx-rng.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#87: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/ixp4xx-rng.c:26:
+#include <asm/io.h>

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#90: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/ixp4xx-rng.c:29:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#93: FILE: drivers/char/hw_random/ixp4xx-rng.c:32:
+	void __iomem * rng_base = (void __iomem *)rng->priv;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
