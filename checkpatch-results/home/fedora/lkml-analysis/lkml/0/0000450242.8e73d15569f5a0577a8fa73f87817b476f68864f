a fix for the loop driver to make it constain its queue to the

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:428:
+extern int bio_max_iovecs(request_queue_t *q, int *iovec_size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#99: FILE: fs/bio.c:319:
+	unsigned max_iovecs = min(q->max_phys_segments, q->max_hw_segments);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#106: FILE: fs/bio.c:326:
+		unsigned int max_bytes = q->max_sectors << 9;
+		if (*iovec_size > max_bytes) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
