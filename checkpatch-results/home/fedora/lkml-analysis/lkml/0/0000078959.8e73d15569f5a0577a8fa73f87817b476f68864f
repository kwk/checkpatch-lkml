Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#81: FILE: drivers/scsi/ips.h:113:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

should be::
