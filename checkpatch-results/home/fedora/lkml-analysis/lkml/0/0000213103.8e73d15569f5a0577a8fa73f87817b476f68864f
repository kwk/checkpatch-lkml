The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
