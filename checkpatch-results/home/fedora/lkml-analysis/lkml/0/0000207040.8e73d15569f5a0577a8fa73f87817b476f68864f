CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#110: FILE: include/pcmcia/ss.h:251:
+extern int pcmcia_socket_dev_suspend(struct device *dev, pm_message_t state);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
