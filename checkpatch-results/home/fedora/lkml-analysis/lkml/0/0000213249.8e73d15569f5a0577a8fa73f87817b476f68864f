ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#99: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:181:
buf, size_t count)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#100: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:182:
+fill_write_buffer(struct sysfs_buffer *buffer, const char __user * buf,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#179: FILE: fs/sysfs/file.c:285:
+	if (file->f_flags & O_APPEND) {
+		goto Einval;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
