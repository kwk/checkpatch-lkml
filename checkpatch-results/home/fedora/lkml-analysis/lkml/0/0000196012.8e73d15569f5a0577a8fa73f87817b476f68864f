WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#410: FILE: message/fusion/mptbase.h:483:
+	u8		 mpt_dv;		/* command line option: enhanced=3D1, basic=3D0 */=0A=

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
