WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#95: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:1202:
+		extern void __init root_nfs_parse_addr(char *name, u32 *addr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#97: FILE: net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:1204:
+		u32 addr = INADDR_NONE;
+		root_nfs_parse_addr(root_server_path, &addr);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
