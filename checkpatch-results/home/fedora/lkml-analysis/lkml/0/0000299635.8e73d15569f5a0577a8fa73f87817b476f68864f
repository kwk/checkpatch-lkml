#35: 
Can you try the latest code from our repo at linux1394.org? Or atleast
                                                               ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#52: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/csr1212.c:711:
+                                }$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#52: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/csr1212.c:711:
+                                }$

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#63: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/csr1212.c:1354:
+			 * then skip it. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
