CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#49: FILE: include/linux/timeofday.h:33:
+extern u32 timeofday_get_clockres(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#67: FILE: kernel/time/timeofday.c:659:
+	u32 res;
+	do {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
