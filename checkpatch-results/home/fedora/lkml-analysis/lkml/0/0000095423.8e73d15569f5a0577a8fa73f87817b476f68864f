#34: 
Ok this patch is only compile tested only but is reasonably straight forward.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: include/linux/swap-prefetch.h:36:
+extern void post_resume_swap_prefetch(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (16, 32)
#208: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:507:

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
