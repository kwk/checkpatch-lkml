+        ---help---
+          Ethernet (also called IEEE 802.3 or ISO 8802-2) is the most common
+          type of Local Area Network (LAN) in universities and companies.
+          
+          Common varieties of Ethernet are: 10BASE-2 or Thinnet (10 Mbps over
+          coaxial cable, linking computers in a chain), 10BASE-T or twisted
+          pair (10 Mbps over twisted pair cable, linking computers to central
+          hubs), 10BASE-F (10 Mbps over optical fiber links, using hubs),
+          100BASE-TX (100 Mbps over two twisted pair cables, using hubs),
+          100BASE-T4 (100 Mbps over 4 standard voice-grade twisted pair
+          cables, using hubs), 100BASE-FX (100 Mbps over optical fiber links)
+          [the 100BASE varieties are also known as Fast Ethernet], and Gigabit
+          Ethernet (1 Gbps over optical fiber or short copper links).
+          
+          If your Linux machine will be connected to an Ethernet and you have
+          an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) installed in your computer,
+          say Y here and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
+          <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>. You will then also have
+          to say Y to the driver for your particular NIC.
+        
+          Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
+          kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all 
+          the questions about Ethernet network cards. If unsure, say N.

 	---help---
 	  Say Y here if you have an Alteon AceNIC, 3Com 3C985(B), NetGear
 	  GA620, SGI Gigabit or Farallon PN9000-SX PCI Gigabit Ethernet

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
