#31: 
I've been doing some hacking on the IDE layer, just to fix a few issues I noticed going through the code. Due to the complex nature of the code I'm bound to have missed some things and perhaps misunderstood others. Nevertheless I'm posting these patches in the hope that they can be tested on other machines, rejected, or even accepted.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#67: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-proc.c:354:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
