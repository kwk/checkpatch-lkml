Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#155: FILE: init/Kconfig:90:
+config SWAP_PREFETCH
+	bool "Support for prefetching swapped memory (EXPERIMENTAL)"
+	depends on SWAP && EXPERIMENTAL
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  This option will allow the kernel to prefetch swapped memory pages
+	  when idle. The pages will be kept on both swap and in swap_cache
+	  thus avoiding the need for further I/O if either ram or swap space
+	  is required. This is desirable on workstations.
+	  Desktop users will most likely want to say Y.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'prepare_prefetch', this function's name, in a string
#270: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:42:
+		panic("prepare_prefetch(): cannot create swapped_entry SLAB cache");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#303: FILE: mm/swap_prefetch.c:75:
+	if (likely(!error)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
