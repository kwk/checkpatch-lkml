#30: 
I was able to replicate the Bug, even when all the drivers are built into the kernel. 

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'kernel' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (7, 15)

        for (depth = 0, p = r; depth < MAX_IORES_LEVEL; depth++, p = p->parent){

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#42: FILE: resource.c:84:
+               if (p->parent == root || p->parent == NULL)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
