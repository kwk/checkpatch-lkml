CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#212: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.h:49:
+#define UART_CAP_NOMSR	(1 << 13)	/* UART has no modem status bits (Au1x00) */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
