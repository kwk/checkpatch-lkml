WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'scripts' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#75: FILE: patch-kernel:3:
+#   usage: patch-kernel [ sourcedir [ patchdir [ stopversion ] [ -acxx ] [ -prexx ] ] ]

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'PARM' may be misspelled - perhaps 'PARAM'?
#101: FILE: patch-kernel:60:
+		  gotpre=$PARM;
 		          ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
