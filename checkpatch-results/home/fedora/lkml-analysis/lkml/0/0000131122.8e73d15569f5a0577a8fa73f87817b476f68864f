WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#126: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:758:
+	unsigned ordered = QUEUE_ORDERED_NONE;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#130: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:762:
+	if (drive->wcache) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
