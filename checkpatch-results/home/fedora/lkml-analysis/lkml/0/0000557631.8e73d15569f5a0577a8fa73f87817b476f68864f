WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#13: 
Subject: Re: ramfs problem... (unlink of sparse file in "D" state)

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <UnlockPage>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
