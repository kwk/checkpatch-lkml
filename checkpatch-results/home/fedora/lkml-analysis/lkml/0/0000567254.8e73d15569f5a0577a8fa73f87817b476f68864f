BTW, I wanted to take a look at the frequently mentioned beancounter patch,

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#88: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:40:
+extern int vm_reserved;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#96: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:263:
+^I{VM_RESERVED, "reserved", $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
