ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_PREFETCH_SWITCH_STACK' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#96: FILE: include/asm-ia64/system.h:277:
+#define ARCH_HAS_PREFETCH_SWITCH_STACK

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#107: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:596:
+extern void prefetch_stack(struct task_struct*);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#107: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:596:
+extern void prefetch_stack(struct task_struct*);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
