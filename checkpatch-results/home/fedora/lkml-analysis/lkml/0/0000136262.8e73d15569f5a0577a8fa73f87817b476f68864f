WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#45: FILE: fs/aio.c:40:
+#define AIO_DEBUG_BUG_ON BUG_ON

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#48: FILE: fs/aio.c:43:
+#define AIO_DEBUG_BUG_ON(x...) do { ; } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#64: FILE: fs/aio.c:184:
+	unsigned nr_events = ctx->max_reqs;

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#66: FILE: fs/aio.c:186:
+	BUG_ON(ctx->reqs_active);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '__put_ioctx', this function's name, in a string
#73: FILE: fs/aio.c:193:
+	pr_debug("__put_ioctx: freeing %p\n", ctx);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
