ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#103: FILE: lib/bitmap.c:543:
+^I     ^Iord++;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#103: FILE: lib/bitmap.c:543:
+^I     ^Iord++;$

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#105: FILE: lib/bitmap.c:545:
+	BUG_ON(i != pos);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
