#25: 
In a recent fixup i386 code was copied raw to x86_64 subarch to make it compile

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#52: FILE: include/asm-um/ldt-x86_64.h:48:
+ * 64bit system calls require __USER_CS. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
