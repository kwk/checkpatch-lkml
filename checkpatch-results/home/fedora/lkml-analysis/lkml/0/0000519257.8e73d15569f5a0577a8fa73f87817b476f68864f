#24: 
And now the second part - we expand the call of read_super() in get_sb_bdev()

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#39: FILE: fs/super.c:901:
+	struct super_block * s;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#76: FILE: fs/super.c:971:
+	list_add (&s->s_list, super_blocks.prev);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
