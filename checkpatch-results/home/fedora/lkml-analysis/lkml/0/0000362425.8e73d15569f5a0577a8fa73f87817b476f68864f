--- a/drivers/input/mouse/Kconfig	Sat Jun 14 22:24:35 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#389: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:216:
+	psmouse->private = priv = kmalloc(sizeof(struct synaptics_data), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*priv)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct synaptics_data)...)
#389: FILE: drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c:216:
+	psmouse->private = priv = kmalloc(sizeof(struct synaptics_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <inSync>
