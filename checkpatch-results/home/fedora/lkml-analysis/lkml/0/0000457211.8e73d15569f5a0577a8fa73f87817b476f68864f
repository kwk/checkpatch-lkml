CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#112: FILE: include/asm-ppc/tlb.h:27:
+extern void tlb_flush(struct free_pte_ctx *tlb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Hash>
#190: FILE: arch/ppc/mm/tlb.c:66:
+	if (Hash != 0) {

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "mp"
#245: FILE: arch/ppc/mm/tlb.c:159:
+	for (mp = mm->mmap; mp != NULL; mp = mp->vm_next)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
