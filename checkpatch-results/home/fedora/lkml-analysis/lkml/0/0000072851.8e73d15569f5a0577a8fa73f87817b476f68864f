along with a few changed I made to locking symantics.  So far a 2.6.16

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#135: FILE: fs/dcache.c:184:
+  ^I^I^Ilist_del_init(&dentry->d_lru);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo*	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#229: FILE: fs/dcache.c:304:
+	struct dentry*	ret;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)

#667: FILE: mm/truncate.c:83:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
