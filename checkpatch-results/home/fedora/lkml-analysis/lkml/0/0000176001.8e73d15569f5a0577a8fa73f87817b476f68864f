+ * This function should be used by other kernel subsystems attempting to use the tpm through the tpm_transmit interface.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#43: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:57:
+struct tpm_chip* tpm_chip_lookup(int chip_num)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#45: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:59:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#47: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:61:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
