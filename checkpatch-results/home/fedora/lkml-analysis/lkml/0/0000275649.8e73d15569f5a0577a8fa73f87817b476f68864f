Here's an update to my patch. Thanks to Ingo Oeser for noticing that the patch

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#264: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:224:
+extern void inode_init_early(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#272: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1203:
+extern void vfs_caches_init_early(void);

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after nr_kernel_pages
#316: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:58:
+static unsigned long __initdata nr_kernel_pages;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after nr_all_pages
#317: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:59:
+static unsigned long __initdata nr_all_pages;

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __pure over __attribute__((pure))
#343: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2010:
+static inline int log2(unsigned long x) __attribute__((pure));

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#347: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2014:
+	int r = 0;
+	for (x >>= 1; x > 0; x >>= 1)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#370: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2037:
+	 * nearest power of 2 in size) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
