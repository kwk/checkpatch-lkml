CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/mutex.h:128:
+extern int mutex_lock_interruptible_nested(struct mutex *lock, unsigned int subclass);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
