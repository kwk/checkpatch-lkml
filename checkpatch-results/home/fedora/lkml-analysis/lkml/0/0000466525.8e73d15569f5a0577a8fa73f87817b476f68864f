CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#51: FILE: drivers/video/radeon.h:399:
+#define HDP_SOFT_RESET                             (1 << 26)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#129: FILE: drivers/video/radeonfb.c:606:
+static char nomtrr __initdata = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#157: FILE: drivers/video/radeonfb.c:1010:
+	rinfo->mtrr_hdl = nomtrr ? -1 : mtrr_add(rinfo->fb_base_phys, rinfo->video_ram, MTRR_TYPE_WRCOMB, 1);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#189: FILE: drivers/video/radeonfb.c:1723:
+                        disp->dispsw = accel ? &fbcon_radeon8 : &fbcon_cfb8;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#189: FILE: drivers/video/radeonfb.c:1723:

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#215: FILE: drivers/video/radeonfb.c:3011:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
