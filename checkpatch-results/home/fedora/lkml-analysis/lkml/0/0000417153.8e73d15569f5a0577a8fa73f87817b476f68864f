Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct inode_operations should normally be const
#108: FILE: include/linux/msdos_fs.h:234:
+	struct inode_operations *dir_ops;/* Default directory operations */

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
