Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'is_syscall', this function's name, in a string
#69: FILE: arch/um/sys-i386/ptrace.c:37:
+			printk("is_syscall : failed to read instruction from "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
