Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
