ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#51: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:567:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.
