ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#98: FILE: dmsetup/dmsetup.c:519:
+	if (!(dmt = dm_task_create(DM_DEVICE_SETGEO)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#111: FILE: dmsetup/dmsetup.c:532:
+	for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
+		printf("_setgeo[%d] = %s\n", i, argv[i]);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '_setgeo', this function's name, in a string
#112: FILE: dmsetup/dmsetup.c:533:
+		printf("_setgeo[%d] = %s\n", i, argv[i]);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
