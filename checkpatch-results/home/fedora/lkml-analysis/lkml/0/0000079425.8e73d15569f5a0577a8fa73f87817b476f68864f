WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#65: FILE: include/asm-i386/mce.h:1:
+#ifdef CONFIG_X86_MCE

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/asm-i386/mce.h:2:
+extern void mcheck_init(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#68: FILE: include/asm-i386/mce.h:4:
+#define mcheck_init(c) do {} while(0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
