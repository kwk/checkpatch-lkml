CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#87: FILE: sound/core/sgbuf.c:71:
+	dmab->private_data = sgbuf = kzalloc(sizeof(*sgbuf), GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pipe)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct audiopipe)...)
#141: FILE: sound/pci/echoaudio/echoaudio.c:239:
+	pipe = kzalloc(sizeof(struct audiopipe), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*new_client)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct i2c_client)...)
