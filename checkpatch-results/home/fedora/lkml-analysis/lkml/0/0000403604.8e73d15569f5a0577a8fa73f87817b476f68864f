#23: 
the attached patch fixes the crash top or cat /proc/*/wchan produces when using KALLSYMS

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#52: FILE: kernel/kallsyms.c:50:
+			unsigned prefix = *name++;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#53: FILE: kernel/kallsyms.c:51:
+			unsigned prefix = *name++;
+			strncpy(namebuf + prefix, name, 127 - prefix);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
