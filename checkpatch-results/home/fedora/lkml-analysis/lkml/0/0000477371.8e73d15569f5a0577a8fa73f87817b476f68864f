ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#30: FILE: drivers/char/ftape/lowlevel/fdc-io.c:929:
+	set_dma_addr(fdc.dma, isa_virt_to_bus((void*)addr));

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
