CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#162: FILE: mm/mmap.c:1060:
+				start_addr = addr = TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE_2;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
