#41: 
Please find below one out of collection of patched that move NR_CPU array variables to the per-cpu area.  Please consider applying,

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#72: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:504:
+	struct tss_struct * t = &per_cpu(init_tss, cpu);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
