WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#48: FILE: af_inet.c:1166:
+extern int  tcp_get_info(char *buffer, char **start, off_t offset, int length);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
