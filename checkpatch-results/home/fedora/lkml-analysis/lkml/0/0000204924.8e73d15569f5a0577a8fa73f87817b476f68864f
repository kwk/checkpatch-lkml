#40: 
the device /dev/usb/ttyACM0, but writting was ok. The led "data" was lit
                                 ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#45: 
usb_submit_urb(acm->readurb), _inside_ acm_tty_open, and that time acm->used

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#70: FILE: drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.c:275:
+	if (acm->used++) {
 		goto done;
         }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'acm_tty_write', this function's name, in a string
#138: FILE: drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.c:342:
+	dbg("Entering acm_tty_write to write %d bytes,", count);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
#156: FILE: drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.c:543:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
