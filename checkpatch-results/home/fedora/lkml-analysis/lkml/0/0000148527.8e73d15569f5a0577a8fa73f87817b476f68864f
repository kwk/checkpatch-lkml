WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'int' should also have an identifier name
#66: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:415:
+	int (*send_actor)(int, struct sigqueue *, struct task_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#109: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:452:
+		if (unlikely(timr->it_process->flags & PF_EXITING)) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "zombie"
#122: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:465:
+	if (unlikely(zombie != NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#145: FILE: kernel/signal.c:1373:
+		BUG_ON(q->info.si_code != SI_TIMER);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
