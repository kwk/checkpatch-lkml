ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#41: 
--- a/drivers/ide/ide-disk.c	2005-02-24 15:29:50 +01:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#256: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-io.c:343:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ide_tf_get_address);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'ide_drive_t *' should also have an identifier name
#305: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1211:
+u64 ide_tf_get_address(ide_drive_t *, struct ata_taskfile *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ata_taskfile *' should also have an identifier name
#305: FILE: include/linux/ide.h:1211:
+u64 ide_tf_get_address(ide_drive_t *, struct ata_taskfile *);
