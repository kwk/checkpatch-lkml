I like the idea of the swappiness switch. It seems to me that this shouldn't be

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to

loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
