#24: 
Modify the uinput driver for the new force feedback interface. The userspace

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#79: FILE: drivers/input/misc/uinput.c:131:
+static int uinput_dev_upload_effect(struct input_dev *dev, struct ff_effect *effect, struct ff_effect *old)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#156: FILE: drivers/input/misc/uinput.c:502:
+				/* EV_FF shall not be touched by the driver
+				   it is set by force feedback subsystem */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#246: FILE: include/linux/uinput.h:55:
+			struct ff_effect* effect;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#278: FILE: include/linux/uinput.h:131:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
