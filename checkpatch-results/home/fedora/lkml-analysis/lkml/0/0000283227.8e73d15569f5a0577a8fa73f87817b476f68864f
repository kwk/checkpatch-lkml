Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#421: FILE: include/linux/i2c.h:289:
+#define I2C_CLASS_HWMON		(1<<0)	/* lm_sensors, ... */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
