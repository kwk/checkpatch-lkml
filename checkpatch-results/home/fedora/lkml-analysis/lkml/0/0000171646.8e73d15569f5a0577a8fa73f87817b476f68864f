ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#143: FILE: kernel/timer.c:102:
+	while (msecs--) udelay(1000);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#143: FILE: kernel/timer.c:102:
+	while (msecs--) udelay(1000);

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.
