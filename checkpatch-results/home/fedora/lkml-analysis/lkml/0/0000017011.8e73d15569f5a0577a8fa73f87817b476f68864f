WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#36: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .3
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#401: FILE: drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c:4716:
+	if (netif_running(netdev) && (ret_val = e1000_request_irq(adapter)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#443: FILE: drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c:1737:
+	{ USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, 0x0215, HID_QUIRK_POWERBOOK_HAS_FN | HID_QUIRK_POWERBOOK_ISO_KEYBOARD},

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#697: FILE: fs/cifs/inode.c:889:
+			/* else rc is still EEXIST so will fall through to

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#698: FILE: fs/cifs/inode.c:890:
+			/* else rc is still EEXIST so will fall through to
+			   unlink the target and retry rename */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __packed over __attribute__((packed))
#783: FILE: include/linux/ufs_fs.h:903:
+		} __attribute__ ((packed)) fs_u2;

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#796: FILE: mm/migrate.c:953:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
