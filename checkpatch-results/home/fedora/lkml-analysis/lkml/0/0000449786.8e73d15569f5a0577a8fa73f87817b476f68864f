#54: 
I know of 3 people in total so far that had this SB16 fullduplex problem, BTW

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+		 * for 16bit output (which needs 2 bytes/sample)... */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

spaces are never used for indentation.
