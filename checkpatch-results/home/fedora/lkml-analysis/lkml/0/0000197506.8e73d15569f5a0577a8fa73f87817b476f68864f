WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#108: FILE: drivers/video/console/bitblit.c:203:
+	/* buf is always NULL except when in monochrome mode, so in this case
+	   it's a gain to check buf against NULL even though kfree() handles

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#109: FILE: drivers/video/console/bitblit.c:204:
+	   NULL pointers just fine */

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#110: FILE: drivers/video/console/bitblit.c:205:
+^Iif (buf)^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:NEEDLESS_IF: kfree(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required
#111: FILE: drivers/video/console/bitblit.c:206:
+	if (buf)	
+		kfree(buf);

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <gSaveImagePtr>
#125: FILE: drivers/video/w100fb.c:540:
+		kfree(gSaveImagePtr[i]);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
