WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'errror' may be misspelled - perhaps 'error'?
#50: 
Now that the mount command correctly decipher the errror
                                                  ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'nfs_get_root', this function's name, in a string
#72: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:240:
+		dprintk("nfs_get_root: getattr error = %d\n", -error);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'nfs_sb_init', this function's name, in a string
#108: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:344:
+	dprintk("nfs_sb_init: get root inode failed: errno %d\n", -no_root_error);
