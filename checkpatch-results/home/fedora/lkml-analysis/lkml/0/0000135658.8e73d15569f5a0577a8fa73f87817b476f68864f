WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#60: FILE: init/Kconfig:327:
+config FULL_PANIC
+	default y
+	bool "Full panic reporting data" if EMBEDDED
+	help
+	  This includes text descriptions of panics in addition to stack dumps.
+          Disabling compiles out the explanations for panics, saving
+	  string space. Use with caution.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_emerg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_emerg(dev, ... then pr_emerg(...  to printk(KERN_EMERG ...
#107: FILE: kernel/panic.c:88:
+	printk(KERN_EMERG "Kernel panic - not syncing\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'panic', this function's name, in a string
#107: FILE: kernel/panic.c:88:
+	printk(KERN_EMERG "Kernel panic - not syncing\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
