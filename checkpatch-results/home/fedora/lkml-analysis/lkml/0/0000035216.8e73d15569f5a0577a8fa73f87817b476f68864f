CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#151: FILE: drivers/mtd/maps/cstm_mips_ixx.c:214:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#297: FILE: drivers/mtd/maps/nettel.c:473:

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

distractions when editing files.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'init_redwood_flash', this function's name, in a string
#376: FILE: drivers/mtd/maps/redwood.c:150:
+			printk("init_redwood_flash: add_mtd_partitions failed\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
