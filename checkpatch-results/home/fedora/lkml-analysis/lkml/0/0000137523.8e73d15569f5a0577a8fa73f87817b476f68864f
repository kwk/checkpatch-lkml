WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'submited' may be misspelled - perhaps 'submitted'?
#122: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:3045:
+ * submited by a make_request_fn function.
    ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around current->bio_tail
#133: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:3056:
+		*(current->bio_tail) = bio;

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'explantion' may be misspelled - perhaps 'explanation'?
#139: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:3062:
+	 * explantion.
 	   ^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#156: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:3079:
+	BUG_ON(bio->bi_next);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!bio->bi_next"
#159: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:3082:
+		if (bio->bi_next == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
