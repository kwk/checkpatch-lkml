we don't stomp on uptodate bits for the buffers
                  ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#76: FILE: fs/buffer.c:452:
+^I/* we might be here because some of the buffers on this page are $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#82: FILE: fs/buffer.c:458:
+		printk("__find_get_block_slow() failed. "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using '__find_get_block_slow', this function's name, in a string
#82: FILE: fs/buffer.c:458:
+		printk("__find_get_block_slow() failed. "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#83: FILE: fs/buffer.c:459:
+		printk("__find_get_block_slow() failed. "
+			"block=%llu, b_blocknr=%llu\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
