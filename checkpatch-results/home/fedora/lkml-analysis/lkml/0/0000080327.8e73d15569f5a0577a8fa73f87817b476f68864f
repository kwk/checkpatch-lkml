#23: 
Nick Piggin rightly pointed out that the introduction of AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE to

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#61: FILE: mm/readahead.c:185:
+			mapping->a_ops->readpage(filp, page);
 			                         ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#64: FILE: mm/readahead.c:188:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
