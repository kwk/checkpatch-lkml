ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#66: 
--- a/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c	2003-06-13 16:51:39 +0200

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!skb"
#75: FILE: net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:1143:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
