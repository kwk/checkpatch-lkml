CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#103: FILE: lib/string.c:119:
+	if (ret >= size)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#105: FILE: lib/string.c:121:
+	else {

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#142: FILE: lib/string.c:204:
 	if (len >= count)
+		{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
