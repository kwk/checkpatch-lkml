CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!inode"

+	if (inode == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

+	    || (generation && inode->i_generation != generation)

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#68: FILE: fs/ext2/super.c:279:

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.
