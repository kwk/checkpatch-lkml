Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#80: FILE: fs/open.c:739:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#107: FILE: fs/open.c:766:
+int do_copyfile(const char *from, const char *to, int mode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#108: FILE: fs/open.c:767:
+int do_rename(const char * oldname, const char * newname);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
