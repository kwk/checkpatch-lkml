ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#66: FILE: scripts/cramfs/mkcramfs.c:75:
+static time_t newest_time = 0; /* Newest file in the filesystem */

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#76: FILE: scripts/cramfs/mkcramfs.c:583:
+		if (st.st_mtime > newest_time) {
+			newest_time = st.st_mtime;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#90: FILE: scripts/cramfs/mkcramfs.c:721:
+	fprintf(stderr, "Newest time: %lu = %s \n", (unsigned long)newest_time, ctime(&newest_time));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
