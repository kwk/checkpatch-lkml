#63: 
Here is a patch against 2.6.12-rc2-mm3. Should apply against rc3-mm3 as well

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#84: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:18:
+#define lock_cpuset_sem()	down(&cpuset_sem);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
