CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'time_phase >= FINENSEC'
#110: FILE: kernel/timer.c:786:
+	if ((time_phase >= FINENSEC) || (time_phase <= -FINENSEC)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#157: FILE: kernel/timer.c:840:
+		long delta_nsec = tick_nsec + adjtime_adjustment() * 1000;
+		delta_nsec += phase_advance();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
