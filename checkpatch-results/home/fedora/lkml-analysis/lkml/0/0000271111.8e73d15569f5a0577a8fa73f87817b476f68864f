Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements

+       asm ( "larl %0,per_cpu__"#var"@GOTENT" : "=a" (__ptr) : "a" (&per_cpu__##var) ); \

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");
