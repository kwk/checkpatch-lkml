#28: 
x86_64 genapic mechanism should be aware of machines that use physical APIC mode regardless of how many clusters/processors are detected. ACPI 3.0 FADT makes this determination very simple by providing a feature flag "force_apic_physical_destination_mode" to state whether the machine unconditionally uses physical APIC mode. Unisys' next generation x86_64 ES7000 will need to utilize this FADT feature flag in order to boot the x86_64 kernel in the correct APIC mode. This patch has been tested on both x86_64 commodity and ES7000 boxes.
