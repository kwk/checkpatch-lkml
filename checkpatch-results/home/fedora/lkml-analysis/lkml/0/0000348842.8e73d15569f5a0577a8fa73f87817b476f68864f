ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#50: FILE: drivers/char/Kconfig:1007:
+^Ibool "Allow userspace access to memory" $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#87: FILE: drivers/char/mem.c:660:
+#if defined(CONFIG_MEMORY_ACCESS)
 	{1, "mem",     S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP, &mem_fops},

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
