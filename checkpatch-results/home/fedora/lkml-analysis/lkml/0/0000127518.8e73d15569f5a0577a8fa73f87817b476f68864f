Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 123 exceeds 100 columns
#216: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:2594:
+MODULE_PARM_DESC(nr_uarts, "Maximum number of UARTs supported. (1-" __MODULE_STRING(CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS) ")");

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
