#29: 
[PATCH] USB: move usb core to use class_simple instead of it's own class functions.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'temp[1] != 0x00'
#113: FILE: drivers/usb/core/file.c:168:
+	if (temp && (temp[1] != 0x00))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#117: FILE: drivers/usb/core/file.c:172:
+	intf->class_dev = class_simple_device_add(usb_class, MKDEV(USB_MAJOR, minor), &intf->dev, "%s", temp);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
