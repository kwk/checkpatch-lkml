Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

 struct rcu_ctrlblk rcu_ctrlblk =

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
