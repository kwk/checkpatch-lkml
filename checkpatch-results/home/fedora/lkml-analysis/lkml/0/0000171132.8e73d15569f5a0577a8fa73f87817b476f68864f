WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#70: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/gx-suspmod.c:193:
+		if ((pci_match_id(gx_chipset_tbl, gx_pci)) != NULL) {
 			return gx_pci;
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#437: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:484:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(pci_match_id);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
