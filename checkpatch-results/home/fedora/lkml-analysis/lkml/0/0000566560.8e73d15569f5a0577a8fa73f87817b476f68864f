WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#30: 
Hm, must admit that I wasn't 100% sure if that's in the kernel lib or an evil

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#36: 
#include <linux/ctype.h>

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#57: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:172:
+	const char * p;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#63: FILE: kernel/kmod.c:178:
+	for (p = module_name; *p; p++)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
