Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#95: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.h:43:
+	u8 (*status) (struct tpm_chip *);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct tpm_chip *' should also have an identifier name
#95: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.h:43:
+	u8 (*status) (struct tpm_chip *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#106: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_nsc.c:222:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
