WARNING:CVS_KEYWORD: CVS style keyword markers, these will _not_ be updated
#46: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/blacklist.c:4:
+ *   $Revision: 1.35 $

Since linux moved to git, the CVS markers are no longer used.
So, CVS style keywords ($Id$, $Revision$, $Log$) should not be
added.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
