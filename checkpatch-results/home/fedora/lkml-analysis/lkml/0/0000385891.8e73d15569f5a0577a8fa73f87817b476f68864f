CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#164: FILE: ibmphp_ebda.new.c:598:
+	char *str = (char *) kmalloc (3, GFP_KERNEL);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#164: FILE: ibmphp_ebda.new.c:598:
+	char *str = (char *) kmalloc (3, GFP_KERNEL);

WARNING:UNNECESSARY_CASTS: unnecessary cast may hide bugs, see http://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html
#164: FILE: ibmphp_ebda.new.c:598:
+	char *str = (char *) kmalloc (3, GFP_KERNEL);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#165: FILE: ibmphp_ebda.new.c:599:
+	char *str = (char *) kmalloc (3, GFP_KERNEL);
+	if (!str)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#166: FILE: ibmphp_ebda.new.c:600:
+^I^Ireturn NULL;^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
