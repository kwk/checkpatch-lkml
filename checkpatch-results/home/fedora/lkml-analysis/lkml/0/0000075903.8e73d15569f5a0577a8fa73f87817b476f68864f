The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

not empty like the former::

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#130: FILE: drivers/mtd/nand/ams-delta.c:76:
+	switch (cmd) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

constructs like::

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
