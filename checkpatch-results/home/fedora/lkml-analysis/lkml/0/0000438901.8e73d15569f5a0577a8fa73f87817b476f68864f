#23: 
  recently I found that my (2.5.31) system sometime oopses when I hit a key 

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'hda' may be misspelled - perhaps 'had'?
#63: 
something (dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null works for me), switch to VT 2, and
                      ^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#80: FILE: drivers/char/console.c:2399:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#85: FILE: drivers/char/console.c:2404:
+	vt = (struct vt_struct*)tty->driver_data;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#86: FILE: drivers/char/console.c:2405:
+	if (vt) {
+		vc_cons[vt->vc_num].d->vc_tty = NULL;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
