   - no changes required for drivers or architectures with HAVE_ARCH_PCI_MWI;

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#144: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:933:
+	/* Validate current setting: the PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE must be
+	   equal to or multiple of the right value. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
