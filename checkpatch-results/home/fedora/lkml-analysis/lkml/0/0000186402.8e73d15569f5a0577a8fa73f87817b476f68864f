#24: 
This patch allows xAPIC systems that don't have serial bus for interrupts delivery to by-pass the check on uniquness of IO-APIC IDs. Some of ES7000's panic failing this unnecessary check. The genapic mechanism has NO_IOAPIC_CHECK flag, which is defined in each subarch. The MP boot utilizes it, but the ACPI boot is missing it.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'uniquness' may be misspelled - perhaps 'uniqueness'?
