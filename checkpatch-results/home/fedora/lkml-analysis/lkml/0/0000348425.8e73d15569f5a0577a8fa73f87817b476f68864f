ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/arch/alpha/kernel/osf_sys.c	Tue Aug  5 14:43:21 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

+extern int do_setitimer(int which, struct itimerval *value, struct itimerval *ovalue);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
