#31: 
Kernel 2.6.0-test11 suffers from the same IDE modularisation issues as the ones that got fixed in 2.4.23.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#47: FILE: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:148:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(blk_queue_activity_fn);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#90: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-detect.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#91: FILE: drivers/ide/ide-detect.c:2:
+ *  linux/drivers/ide/ide-detect.c	Version 1

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
