Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#163: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_poweroff.c:616:
+		rc = min(count, (size_t) sizeof(buf));

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:MINMAX: min() should probably be min_t(size_t, count, sizeof(buf))

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#213: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_poweroff.c:666:

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
