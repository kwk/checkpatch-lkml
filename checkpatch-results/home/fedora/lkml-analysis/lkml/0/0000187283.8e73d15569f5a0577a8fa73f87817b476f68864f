ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I^Itpm_write_index(TPM_BASE_ADDR_HI, (base & 0xFF00) >> 8); $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#341: FILE: drivers/chat/tpm/tpm.c:569:
+	dev_mask[chip->dev_num / TPM_NUM_MASK_ENTRIES ] &= !(1 << (chip->dev_num % TPM_NUM_MASK_ENTRIES));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
