CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#88: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:758:
+extern void reparent_to_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#98: FILE: kernel/sched.c:112:
+extern struct task_struct *child_reaper;

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#134: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1254:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "task `%s' exit_signal %d in "

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#135: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1255:
+				__FUNCTION__ "\n",

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#141: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1261:
+	 * which affect scheduling decisions */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around this_task->rlim
#154: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1274:
+	memcpy(this_task->rlim, init_task.rlim, sizeof(*(this_task->rlim)));

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
