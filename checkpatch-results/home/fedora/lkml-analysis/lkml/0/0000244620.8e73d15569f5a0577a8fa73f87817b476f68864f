ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#57: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:1296:
+unsigned long process_ticks(task_t *c) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#117: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:1355:
+		if (!c) return -EINVAL;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#118: FILE: kernel/posix-timers.c:1356:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
