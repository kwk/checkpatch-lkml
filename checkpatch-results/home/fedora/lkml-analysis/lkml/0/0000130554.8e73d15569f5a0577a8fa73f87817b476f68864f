Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
