ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#86: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c:19:
+int mce_disabled = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#175: FILE: include/asm-i386/processor.h:706:
+extern void mcheck_init(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#177: FILE: include/asm-i386/processor.h:708:
+#define mcheck_init(c) do {} while(0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
