WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rp_do_receive', this function's name, in a string
#56: FILE: drivers/char/rocket.c:332:
+	printk(KERN_INFO "rp_do_receive(%d)...", ToRecv);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <CharNStat>

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#117: FILE: drivers/char/rocket.c:409:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "rp_do_receive:insufficient space ToRecv=%d space=%d\n", ToRecv, space);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
