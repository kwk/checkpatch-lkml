WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#47: FILE: drivers/firmware/edd.c:758:
+		edev = kzalloc(sizeof (*edev), GFP_KERNEL);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*new_efivar)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct efivar_entry)...)
#61: FILE: drivers/firmware/efivars.c:618:
+	new_efivar = kzalloc(sizeof(struct efivar_entry), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
