+struct dvb_frontend* vp310_mt312_attach(const struct mt312_config* config,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*state)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct mt312_state)...)
#156: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/frontends/mt312.c:659:
+	state = kmalloc(sizeof(struct mt312_state), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!state"
#157: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/frontends/mt312.c:660:
+	if (state == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dvb_frontend_ops should normally be const
#163: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/frontends/mt312.c:666:
+	memcpy(&state->ops, &vp310_mt312_ops, sizeof(struct dvb_frontend_ops));

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open brace '{'
#169: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/frontends/mt312.c:672:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
