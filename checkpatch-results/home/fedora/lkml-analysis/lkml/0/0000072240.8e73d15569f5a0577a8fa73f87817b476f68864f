WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments

#!/bin/bash                                                                                                                                                          

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'uptodate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'up-to-date'?
#54: 
cramfs_read() clears parts of the src buffer because the page is not uptodate.
                                                                     ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#105: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:170:
+	unsigned i, blocknr, buffer;

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#158: FILE: fs/cramfs/inode.c:205:
+			if (page) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
