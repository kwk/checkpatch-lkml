+	Network packet tracering is achived using kernel probes allowing you
+	to see the network packets while moving up and down the stack. This
+	module uses kprobes mechanism which is highly efficient for dynamic
+	tracing.
+
+	See driver/net/netpktlog.c for details.
+	To compile this driver as a module, choose M.If unsure, say N.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
