ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#39: 
--- a/scripts/Makefile.build

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

# Read .config if it exist, otherwise ignore

Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#48: FILE: scripts/Makefile.build:14:
+include $(if $(wildcard $(kbuild-dir)/Kbuild), $(kbuild-dir)/Kbuild,  $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
