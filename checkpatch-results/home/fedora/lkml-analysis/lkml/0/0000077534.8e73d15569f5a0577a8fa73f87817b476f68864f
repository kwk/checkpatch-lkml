WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 118 exceeds 100 columns
#51: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:272:
+		static const char s[] __initdata = "Not an IBM x440/NUMAQ. Don't use i386 CONFIG_NUMA anywhere else.";

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of const init definition must use __initconst
#51: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:272:
+		static const char s[] __initdata = "Not an IBM x440/NUMAQ. Don't use i386 CONFIG_NUMA anywhere else.";

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.
