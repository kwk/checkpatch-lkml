#31: 
 Subject: [Lhms-devel] Making hotremovable attribute with memory section[4/4]

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#72: FILE: mm/nonlinear.c:73:
+		printk("set mem_section[%d].phys_section: %d :flags=%02x\n", index, mem_section[index].phys_section);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
