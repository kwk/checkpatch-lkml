CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*user_dev)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct uinput_user_dev)...)
#140: FILE: drivers/input/misc/uinput.c:255:
+	user_dev = kmalloc(sizeof(struct uinput_user_dev), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#158: FILE: drivers/input/misc/uinput.c:308:
+	if (test_bit(UIST_CREATED, &udev->state)) {
[...]
-	}
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#166: FILE: drivers/input/misc/uinput.c:314:
+	} else

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#198: FILE: drivers/input/misc/uinput.c:341:
+		if (copy_to_user(buffer + retval, &udev->buff[udev->tail], sizeof(struct input_event)))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
