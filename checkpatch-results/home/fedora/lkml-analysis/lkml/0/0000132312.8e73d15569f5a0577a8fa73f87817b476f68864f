Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/delay.h> instead of <asm/delay.h>
#418: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/tsc.c:11:
+#include <asm/delay.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
