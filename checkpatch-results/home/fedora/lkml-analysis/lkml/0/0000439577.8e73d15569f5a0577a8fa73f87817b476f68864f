CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#159: FILE: fs/nfs/write.c:1140:
+	data->u.v3.res.count   = data->u.v3.args.count = (u32)len;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
