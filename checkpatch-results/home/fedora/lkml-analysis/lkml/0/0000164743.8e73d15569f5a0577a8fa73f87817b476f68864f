Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#412: FILE: include/asm-sparc/fcntl.h:32:
+#define __ARCH_FLOCK64_PAD	short __unused;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
