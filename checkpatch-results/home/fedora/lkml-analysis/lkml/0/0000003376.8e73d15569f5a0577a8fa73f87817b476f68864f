WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#148: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:429:
+	int (*launder_page) (struct page *);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#148: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:429:
+	int (*launder_page) (struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mapping->a_ops->launder_page"
#165: FILE: mm/truncate.c:349:
+	if (page->mapping != mapping || mapping->a_ops->launder_page == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
