WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#190: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:55:
+void set_queue_congested(request_queue_t *q, int rw);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#192: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:57:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#200: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:988:
+	if (pd->bio_queue_size < 3*1024)
 	                          ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#214: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:2173:
+		printk("pkt_make_request: Process %s didn't honor congestion\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'pkt_make_request', this function's name, in a string
#214: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:2173:
+		printk("pkt_make_request: Process %s didn't honor congestion\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
