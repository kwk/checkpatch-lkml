ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#47: FILE: kernel/power/extent.c:27:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#48: FILE: kernel/power/extent.c:28:
+	if (!(result = kmalloc(sizeof(struct extent), GFP_ATOMIC)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*result)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct extent)...)
#48: FILE: kernel/power/extent.c:28:
+	if (!(result = kmalloc(sizeof(struct extent), GFP_ATOMIC)))

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#52: FILE: kernel/power/extent.c:32:
+	result->minimum = result->maximum = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#64: FILE: kernel/power/extent.c:44:
+	BUG_ON(!extent);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
