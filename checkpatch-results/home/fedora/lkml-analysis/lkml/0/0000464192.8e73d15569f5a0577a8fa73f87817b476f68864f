CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#31: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:165:
+extern void __out_of_line_bug(int line) ATTRIB_NORET;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#45: FILE: kernel/panic.c:139:
+	printk("kernel BUG in header file at line %d\n", line);
