Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#81: FILE: drivers/net/3c515.c:477:
+					(char *) corkscrew_isapnp_adapters[i].driver_data, ioaddr, irq);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
