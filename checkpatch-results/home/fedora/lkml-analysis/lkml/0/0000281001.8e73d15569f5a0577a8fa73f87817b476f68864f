CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mm"
#137: FILE: arch/ppc/mm/fault.c:133:
+	if (in_atomic() || mm == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#137: FILE: arch/ppc/mm/fault.c:133:
+	if (in_atomic() || mm == NULL)

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#211: FILE: include/asm-ppc/system.h:85:
+extern int do_page_fault(struct pt_regs *, unsigned long, unsigned long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pt_regs *' should also have an identifier name
#211: FILE: include/asm-ppc/system.h:85:
+extern int do_page_fault(struct pt_regs *, unsigned long, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#211: FILE: include/asm-ppc/system.h:85:
+extern int do_page_fault(struct pt_regs *, unsigned long, unsigned long);
