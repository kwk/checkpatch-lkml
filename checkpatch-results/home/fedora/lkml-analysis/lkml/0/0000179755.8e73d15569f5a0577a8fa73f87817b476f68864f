Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

+		unsigned int val = (u8)buf[off - init_off];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
