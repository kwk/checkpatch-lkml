sys_splice() moves data to/from pipes with a file input/output. sys_vmsplice()

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pipe_buf_operations should normally be const
#124: FILE: fs/splice.c:50:
+	struct pipe_buf_operations *ops;/* ops associated with output pipe */

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pipe_buf_operations should normally be const

+static struct pipe_buf_operations user_page_pipe_buf_ops = {

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#262: FILE: fs/splice.c:301:
+	loff = spd.offset = *ppos & ~PAGE_CACHE_MASK;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#346: FILE: fs/splice.c:1078:
+	unsigned long uaddr = (unsigned long) buffer;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
