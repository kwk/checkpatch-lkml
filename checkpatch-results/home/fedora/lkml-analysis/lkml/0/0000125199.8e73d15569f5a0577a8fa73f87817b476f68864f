WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#58: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/bt8xx/dst_ca.c:591:
+static ssize_t dst_ca_write(struct file *file, const char __user *buffer, size_t length, loff_t *offset)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
