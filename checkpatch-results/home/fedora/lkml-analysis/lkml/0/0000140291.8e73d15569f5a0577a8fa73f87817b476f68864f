WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#55: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:27:
+extern int swsusp_shrink_memory(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#97: FILE: kernel/power/disk.c:106:
+	if (!(error = swsusp_shrink_memory()))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
