WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#41: 
#define GFP_ZONETYPES	((GFP_ZONEMASK + 1) / 2 + 1)		/* Loner */

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'initialialize' may be misspelled - perhaps 'initialize'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#155: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1914:
+				zone_t * lower_zone = pgdat->node_zones + idx;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#174: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1916:
+				lower_zone->lowmem_reserve[j] = presetpages / lower_zone_reserve_ratio[idx];

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
