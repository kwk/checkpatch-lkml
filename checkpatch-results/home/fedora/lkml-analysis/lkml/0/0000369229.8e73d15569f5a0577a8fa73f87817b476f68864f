ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#42: 
--- a/fs/namespace.c	Sun May 18 00:44:23 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!d"
#54: FILE: fs/namespace.c:427:
+		if (d == NULL || d == d->d_parent)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#69: FILE: fs/namespace.c:439:
+	res = q = clone_mnt(mnt, dentry);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#92: FILE: fs/namespace.c:456:
+			nd.mnt = q;
 			^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?
#93: FILE: fs/namespace.c:457:
+			nd.dentry = p->mnt_mountpoint;
 			^^

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Enomem>
#96: FILE: fs/namespace.c:460:
+				goto Enomem;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
