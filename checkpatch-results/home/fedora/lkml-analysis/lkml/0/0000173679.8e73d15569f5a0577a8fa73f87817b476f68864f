ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#45: FILE: kernel/ckrm/rbce/rbce_core.c:32:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#87: FILE: kernel/ckrm/rbce/rbce_internal.h:250:
+extern struct rbce_class *get_class(char *classname, int *classtype);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
