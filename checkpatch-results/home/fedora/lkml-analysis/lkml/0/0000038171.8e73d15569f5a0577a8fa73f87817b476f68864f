ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#69: FILE: drivers/md/dm-exception-store.c:209:
+        ^Ips->snap->chunk_size = max(DM_CHUNK_SIZE_DEFAULT_SECTORS,$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#69: FILE: drivers/md/dm-exception-store.c:209:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#69: FILE: drivers/md/dm-exception-store.c:209:
+        ^Ips->snap->chunk_size = max(DM_CHUNK_SIZE_DEFAULT_SECTORS,$

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#139: FILE: drivers/md/dm-exception-store.c:250:
+	DMWARN("chunk size %llu in device metadata overrides "
+	       "table chunk size of %llu.",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#254: FILE: drivers/md/dm-snap.c:407:
+	chunk_size = simple_strtoul(chunk_size_arg, &value, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#simple-strtol-simple-strtoll-simple-strtoul-simple-strtoull

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#261: FILE: drivers/md/dm-snap.c:414:
+		s->chunk_size = s->chunk_mask = s->chunk_shift = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
