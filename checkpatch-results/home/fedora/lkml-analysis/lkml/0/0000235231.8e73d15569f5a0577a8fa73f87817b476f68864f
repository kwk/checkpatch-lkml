Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#81: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:48:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

#100: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:69:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
