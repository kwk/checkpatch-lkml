CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#143: FILE: drivers/isdn/isdn_audio.c:522:
+		grp[LOGRP] = grp[HIGRP] = -1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#153: FILE: drivers/isdn/isdn_audio.c:526:
+			if (result[i] > DTMF_TRESH) {

+			else if (result[i] < SILENCE_TRESH)

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#157: FILE: drivers/isdn/isdn_audio.c:530:
+			}
+			else if (result[i] < SILENCE_TRESH)

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#174: FILE: drivers/isdn/isdn_audio.c:541:
+					/* good level found. This is allowed only one time per group */

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#177: FILE: drivers/isdn/isdn_audio.c:544:
+						if (grp[LOGRP] >= 0) {

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#178: FILE: drivers/isdn/isdn_audio.c:545:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
