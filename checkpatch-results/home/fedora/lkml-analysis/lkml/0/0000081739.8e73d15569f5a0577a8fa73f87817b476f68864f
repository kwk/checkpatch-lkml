Adds cpu hotplug notifier for the Resouce Groups CPU controller.
                                  ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#42: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:234:
+static void clear_stat_and_propagate(struct cpu_res * res, int cpu)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#67: FILE: kernel/res_group/cpu.c:259:
+	switch (action)	{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
