#28: 
Give pci_find_bus a domain argument and move its declaration to <linux/pci.h>

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/drivers/pci/hotplug/acpiphp_glue.c	Thu Jul  3 18:17:01 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#125: FILE: drivers/pci/search.c:42:
+struct pci_bus * pci_find_bus(int domain, int busnr)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#148: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:546:
+extern struct pci_bus *pci_find_bus(int domain, int busnr);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
