CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#143: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:269:
+^I^I    ^Iif (code != 0xab && code != 0xac)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#143: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:269:

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#182: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:417:
+	while (test_bit(ATKBD_FLAG_ACK, &atkbd->flags) && timeout--) udelay(1);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#230: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:465:
+^I^I    $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
