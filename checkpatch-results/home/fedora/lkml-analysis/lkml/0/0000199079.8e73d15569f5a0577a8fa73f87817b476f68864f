+			"invalid count value %x %Zx\n", count, bufsiz);

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'tpm_transmit', this function's name, in a string
#82: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:154:
+			"tpm_transmit: tpm_send: error %Zd\n", len);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:PRINTF_Z: %Zd is non-standard C, use %zd
#82: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c:154:
+			"tpm_transmit: tpm_send: error %Zd\n", len);

WARNING:PRINTF_Z: %Zd is non-standard C, use %zd
