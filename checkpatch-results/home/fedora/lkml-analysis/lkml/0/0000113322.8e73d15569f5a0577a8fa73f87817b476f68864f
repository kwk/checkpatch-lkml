ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#51: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:69:
+static struct svc_version *	nfsd_acl_version[] = {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:ARRAY_SIZE: Prefer ARRAY_SIZE(nfsd_acl_version)
#57: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:75:
+#define NFSD_ACL_NRVERS		(sizeof(nfsd_acl_version)/sizeof(nfsd_acl_version[0]))

The ARRAY_SIZE(foo) macro should be preferred over
sizeof(foo)/sizeof(foo[0]) for finding number of elements in an
array.

The macro is defined in include/linux/kernel.h::

  #define ARRAY_SIZE(x) (sizeof(x) / sizeof((x)[0]))

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#57: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:75:

                        		                         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#92: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:179:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#97: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:184:
+			if (NFSCTL_VERISSET(nfsd_versbits, i)) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
