ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#89: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/smp.c:229:
+		while(atomic_read(&smp_fn_call.finished) != num_cpus) {}

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#89: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/smp.c:229:
+		while(atomic_read(&smp_fn_call.finished) != num_cpus) {}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
