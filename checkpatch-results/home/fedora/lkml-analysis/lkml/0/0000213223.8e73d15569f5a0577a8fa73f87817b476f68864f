ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#45: 
--- a/drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c	2005-01-21 23:41:42 +01:00

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#123: FILE: drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c:775:
+	if (!(scsi = ide_scsi_get(disk)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#154: FILE: drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c:803:
+	struct ide_scsi_obj *scsi = ide_scsi_g(bdev->bd_disk);
+	return generic_ide_ioctl(scsi->drive, file, bdev, cmd, arg);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
