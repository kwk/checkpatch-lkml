Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#70: FILE: include/linux/mempool.h:33:
+extern void * mempool_alloc_from_pool(mempool_t *pool,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#70: FILE: include/linux/mempool.h:33:
+extern void * mempool_alloc_from_pool(mempool_t *pool,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#71: FILE: include/linux/mempool.h:34:
+extern void * mempool_alloc_from_pool(mempool_t *pool,
+			unsigned int __nocast gfp_mask);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#89: FILE: mm/mempool.c:256:
+		void *element = remove_element(pool);
+		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&pool->lock, flags);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
