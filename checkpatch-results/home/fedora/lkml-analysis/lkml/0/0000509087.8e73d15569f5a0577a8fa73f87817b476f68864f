opened, so if you do a cat /proc/dri/0/vm just after you load any DRM module

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#86: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drm_proc.h:189:
+	if (dev->maplist != NULL) list_for_each(list, &dev->maplist->head) {

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dev->maplist"
#86: FILE: drivers/char/drm/drm_proc.h:189:
+	if (dev->maplist != NULL) list_for_each(list, &dev->maplist->head) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
