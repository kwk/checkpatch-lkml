WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 112 exceeds 100 columns
#61: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:63:
+#define freeze_processes()		do { panic("You need CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND to do sleeps."); } while(0)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#61: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:63:
+#define freeze_processes()		do { panic("You need CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND to do sleeps."); } while(0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
