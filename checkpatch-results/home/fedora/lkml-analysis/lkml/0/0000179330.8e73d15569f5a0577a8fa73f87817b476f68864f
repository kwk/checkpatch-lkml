ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#48: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:210:
+        if (user_address == 0 || in_atomic() || !mm)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#48: FILE: arch/s390/mm/fault.c:210:
+        if (user_address == 0 || in_atomic() || !mm)

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.
