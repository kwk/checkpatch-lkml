ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#54: FILE: drivers/net/atp.c:225:
+   $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#71: FILE: drivers/net/atp.c:412:
+		char outval = (cmd & (1<<num_bits)) ? EE_DATA_WRITE : 0;
 		                       ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#104: FILE: drivers/net/atp.c:895:
 		for (i = 0, mclist = dev->mc_list; mclist && i < dev->mc_count;
 			 i++, mclist = mclist->next)
+		{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#110: FILE: drivers/net/atp.c:899:
+			int filterbit = ether_crc_le(ETH_ALEN, mclist->dmi_addr) & 0x3f;
+			mc_filter[filterbit >> 5] |= cpu_to_le32(1 << (filterbit & 31));

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
