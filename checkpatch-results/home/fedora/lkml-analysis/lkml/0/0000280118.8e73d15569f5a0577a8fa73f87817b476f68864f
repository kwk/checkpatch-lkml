CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#51: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:85:
+extern void smp_freeze(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#72: FILE: kernel/power/smp.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>

+#include <asm/atomic.h>

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#91: FILE: kernel/power/smp.c:20:
+static void smp_pause(void * data)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#99: FILE: kernel/power/smp.c:28:
+			int i;
+			for (i=0; i<10000; i++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxV)
#99: FILE: kernel/power/smp.c:28:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#109: FILE: kernel/power/smp.c:38:
+	 * "idle" thread (or we deadlock). Is that guaranteed? */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

distractions when editing files.
