ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#72: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:899:
+static inline void cond_resched_lock(spinlock_t * lock)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#94: FILE: mm/memory.c:393:
+	BUG_ON(address >= end);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
