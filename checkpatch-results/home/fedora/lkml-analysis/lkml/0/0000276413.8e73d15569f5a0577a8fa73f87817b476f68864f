Patch rediffed agains 2.6.7-rc2-mm2 attached.
               ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#159: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:1073:
+ ^Idmi_check_system(dmi_blacklist);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#159: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:1073:

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#201: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:1174:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(dmi_check_system);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#210: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:1183:
+char * dmi_get_system_info(int field)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#220: FILE: include/linux/dmi.h:1:
+#ifndef __DMI_H__

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dmi_system_id *' should also have an identifier name
#246: FILE: include/linux/dmi.h:27:
+	int (*callback)(struct dmi_system_id *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#256: FILE: include/linux/dmi.h:37:
+extern int dmi_check_system(struct dmi_system_id *list);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
