#63: FILE: fs/sysfs/dir.c:165:
+int sysfs_rename_dir(struct kobject * kobj, const char *new_name)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct kobject *' should also have an identifier name
#105: FILE: include/linux/sysfs.h:47:
+extern int

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#141: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:51:
+extern int kobject_rename(struct kobject *, char *new_name);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
