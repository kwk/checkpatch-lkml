WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#17: 
Subject: [PATCH 2/10] Re: [2.6-BK-URL] NTFS: 2.1.19 sparse annotation, cleanups

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#136: FILE: fs/ntfs/dir.c:1227:
+		fpos = (u8*)ie - (u8*)ir;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
