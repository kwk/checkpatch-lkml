WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#51: FILE: include/linux/page-flags.h:80:
+					 * while testing refcount */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#96: FILE: include/linux/pagemap.h:67:
+	VM_BUG_ON(!in_atomic());

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.
