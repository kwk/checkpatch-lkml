> >> Recent 2.6.5-pre* and -rc1 and -BK don't boot on my Motorola Powerstack

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#70: FILE: arch/ppc/boot/simple/misc-prep.c:38:
+extern void disable_6xx_l1cache(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#79: FILE: arch/ppc/boot/simple/misc-prep.c:156:
+	 * correct.  Also disable the L1s finally. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
