ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#86: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:577:
+				struct page * page;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#87: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:578:
+				struct page * page;
+				page = pfn_to_page(zone_pfn + zone->zone_start_pfn);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#146: FILE: kernel/power/swsusp.c:691:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
