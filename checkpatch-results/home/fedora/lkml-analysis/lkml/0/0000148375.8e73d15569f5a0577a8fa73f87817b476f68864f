CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#120: FILE: mm/memory.c:423:
+	int rss[NO_RSS+1], anon;
 	              ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#123: FILE: mm/memory.c:426:
+	rss[1] = rss[0] = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#133: FILE: mm/memory.c:450:
+		anon = copy_one_pte(dst_mm, src_mm, dst_pte, src_pte,
+							vm_flags, addr);
