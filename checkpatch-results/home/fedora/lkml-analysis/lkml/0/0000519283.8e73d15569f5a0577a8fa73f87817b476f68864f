CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!p"
#97: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:176:
+	if (p == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#103: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:182:
+		if(q->mm == p->mm) oom_kill_task(q);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#103: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:182:
+		if(q->mm == p->mm) oom_kill_task(q);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
