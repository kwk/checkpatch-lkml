CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#52: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:29:
+extern void __delayacct_swapin(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#60: FILE: include/linux/delayacct.h:58:
 }
+static inline void delayacct_swapin(void)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#138: FILE: mm/memory.c:2229:

 					pte, pmd, write_access, entry);
