[PATCH] PCI Hotplug: cpqphp: add release() callback and other minor cleanups.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

--- a/drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_core.c	Thu Jun 26 17:39:08 2003

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
