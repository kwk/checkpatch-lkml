WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 144 exceeds 100 columns
#41: FILE: fs/reiserfs/file.c:319:
+			char *zeros = kzalloc(to_paste * UNFM_P_SIZE, GFP_ATOMIC);	// We cannot insert more than MAX_ITEM_LEN bytes anyway.

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 143 exceeds 100 columns
#58: FILE: fs/reiserfs/inode.c:931:
+				un = kzalloc(min(blocks_needed, max_to_insert) * UNFM_P_SIZE, GFP_ATOMIC);	// We need to avoid scheduling.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*sbi)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct reiserfs_sb_info)...)
#79: FILE: fs/reiserfs/super.c:1552:
+	sbi = kzalloc(sizeof(struct reiserfs_sb_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
