CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#96: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:769:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#117: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:790:
+			if (!(bus = get_bus(bus)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#120: FILE: drivers/base/bus.c:793:
+			/* Okay, we have the next bus, move it ahead
+			   of the marker and perform rescan. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#169: FILE: include/linux/device.h:421:
+extern int dev_autoattach_handler(ctl_table *table, int write,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
