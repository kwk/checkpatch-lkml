CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:45:
+extern int current_in_cpu_hotplug(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#84: FILE: include/linux/cpu.h:58:
 }
+static inline int current_in_cpu_hotplug(void)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
