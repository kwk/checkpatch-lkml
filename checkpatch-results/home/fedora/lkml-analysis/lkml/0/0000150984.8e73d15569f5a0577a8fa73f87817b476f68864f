Subject: [patch 19/28] Input: convert sonypi to dynamic input_dev allocation

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#81: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:1202:
+static int __devinit sonypi_create_input_devices(void)

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#87: FILE: drivers/char/sonypi.c:1208:
+	sonypi_device.input_jog_dev = jog_dev = input_allocate_device();

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
