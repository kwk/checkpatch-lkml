    2: Whenever a switch from X to a framebuffer console occures,
                                                         ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "old_info"
#74: FILE: drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:2106:
+	if (old_info != NULL && old_info != info)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
