WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#63: FILE: include/bc/task.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#64: FILE: include/bc/task.h:2:
+ *  include/bc/task.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'expected' may be better as '(expected)' to avoid precedence issues
#93: FILE: include/bc/task.h:31:
+#define reset_exec_bc(old, expected) do {		\
+		struct task_beancounter *tbc;		\
+		tbc = &current->task_bc;		\
+		BUG_ON(tbc->exec_bc != expected);	\
+		tbc->exec_bc = old;			\
+	} while (0)

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#96: FILE: include/bc/task.h:34:
+		BUG_ON(tbc->exec_bc != expected);	\

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
