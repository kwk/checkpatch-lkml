WARNING:CONSTANT_CONVERSION: __constant_cpu_to_le16 should be cpu_to_le16
#63: FILE: include/linux/ntfs_fs.h:13:
+	ATTR_IS_COMPRESSED      = __constant_cpu_to_le16(0x0001),

Use of __constant_<foo> form is discouraged for the following functions::

  __constant_cpu_to_be[x]
  __constant_cpu_to_le[x]
  __constant_be[x]_to_cpu
  __constant_le[x]_to_cpu
  __constant_htons
  __constant_ntohs

Using any of these outside of include/uapi/ is not preferred as using the
function without __constant_ is identical when the argument is a
constant.

In big endian systems, the macros like __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) and
cpu_to_be32(x) expand to the same expression::

  #define __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) ((__force __be32)(__u32)(x))
  #define __cpu_to_be32(x)          ((__force __be32)(__u32)(x))

In little endian systems, the macros __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) and
cpu_to_be32(x) expand to __constant_swab32 and __swab32.  __swab32
has a __builtin_constant_p check::

  #define __swab32(x)				\
    (__builtin_constant_p((__u32)(x)) ?	\
    ___constant_swab32(x) :			\
    __fswab32(x))

So ultimately they have a special case for constants.
Similar is the case with all of the macros in the list.  Thus
using the __constant_... forms are unnecessarily verbose and
not preferred outside of include/uapi.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
