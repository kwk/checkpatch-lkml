ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#61: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/hermes.c:56:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:MULTISTATEMENT_MACRO_USE_DO_WHILE: Macros starting with if should be enclosed by a do - while loop to avoid possible if/else logic defects
#64: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/hermes.c:58:
+#define DEBUG(lvl, stuff...) if ( (lvl) <= HERMES_DEBUG) DMSG(##stuff)

Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a
do - while block.  Same should also be the case for macros
starting with `if` to avoid logic defects::

  #define macrofun(a, b, c)                 \
    do {                                    \
            if (a == 5)                     \
                    do_this(b, c);          \
    } while (0)
