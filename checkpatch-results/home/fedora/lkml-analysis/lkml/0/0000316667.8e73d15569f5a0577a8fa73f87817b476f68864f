WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#144: FILE: fs/buffer.c:861:
+					printk("%s(%d): dirtied buffer\n", current->comm, current->pid);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:DUPLICATED_SYSCTL_CONST: duplicated sysctl range checking value 'zero', consider using the shared one in include/linux/sysctl.h
#198: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:711:
+		.extra1		= &zero,

Commit d91bff3011cf ("proc/sysctl: add shared variables for range
check") added some shared const variables to be used instead of a local
copy in each source file.

Consider replacing the sysctl range checking value with the shared
one in include/linux/sysctl.h.  The following conversion scheme may
be used::

  &zero     ->  SYSCTL_ZERO
  &one      ->  SYSCTL_ONE
  &int_max  ->  SYSCTL_INT_MAX
