Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#64: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c:2:
+ * arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <remcomInBuffer>
#241: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c:166:
+		     char *remcomInBuffer,

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <remcomOutBuffer>
#242: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c:167:
+		     char *remcomOutBuffer, struct pt_regs *linux_regs)

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <kgdb_hexToLong>
#284: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c:188:
+		if (kgdb_hexToLong(&ptr, &addr))

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct kgdb_arch should normally be const
#362: FILE: arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c:250:
+struct kgdb_arch arch_kgdb_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
