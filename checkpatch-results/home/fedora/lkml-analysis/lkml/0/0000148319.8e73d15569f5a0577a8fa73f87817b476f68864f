Name: Ignore trailing whitespace on kernel parameters correctly: Fixed version

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#78: FILE: kernel/params.c:124:
+	while (*next == ' ') next++;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
