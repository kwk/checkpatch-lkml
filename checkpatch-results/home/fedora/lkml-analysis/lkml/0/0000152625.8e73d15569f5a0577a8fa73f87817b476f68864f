Subject: [PATCH] Input: clean up whitespace and formatting in drivers/char/keyboard.c

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#97: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:167:
+		struct input_handle *handle = to_handle_h(node);
+		if (handle->dev->keycodesize) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#324: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:1191:
+	if (!(handle = kmalloc(sizeof(struct input_handle), GFP_KERNEL)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*handle)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct input_handle)...)
#324: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:1191:
+	if (!(handle = kmalloc(sizeof(struct input_handle), GFP_KERNEL)))

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#345: FILE: drivers/char/keyboard.c:1220:
+        },$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
