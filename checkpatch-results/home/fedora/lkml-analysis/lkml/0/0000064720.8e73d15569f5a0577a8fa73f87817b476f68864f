Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
