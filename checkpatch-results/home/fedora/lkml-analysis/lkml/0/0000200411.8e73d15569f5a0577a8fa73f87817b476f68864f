#26: 
This patch adds per disk queue functionality. It seems that the 2.6 kernel expects a queue per disk. If you have multiple logical drives on a controller all of the queues actually point back to the same queue. If a drive is deleted it blows us out of the water.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
