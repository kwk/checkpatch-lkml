This patch is a forward port of the fairsched-2.4.19 patch by Rik van Riel, which

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#61: FILE: include/linux/sysctl.h:132:
+  ^IKERN_FAIRSCHED=57,^I/* int: turn per-user fair cpu scheduler on/off */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#100: FILE: kernel/sysctl.c:60:
+extern int fairsched;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
