#26: 
Currently we have various vm counters that are split per cpu. This arrangement

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#62: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:565:
+void refresh_vm_stats(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#72: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:575:
+			int * p = vm_stat_diff[cpu][node]+i;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#73: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:576:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
