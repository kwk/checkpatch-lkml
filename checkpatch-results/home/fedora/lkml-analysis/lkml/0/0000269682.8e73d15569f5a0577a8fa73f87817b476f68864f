CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:593:
+extern void truncate_complete_page(struct address_space *mapping,struct page *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
