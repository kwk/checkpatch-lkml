ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#51: 
--- a/drivers/usb/rio500.c	Mon Jun 25 10:31:03 2001

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#73: FILE: drivers/usb/rio500.c:64:
+        devfs_handle_t devfs;           /* devfs device */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0640'.
#109: FILE: drivers/usb/rio500.c:458:
+				    S_IFCHR | S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP |

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rio->devfs"
#111: FILE: drivers/usb/rio500.c:460:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
