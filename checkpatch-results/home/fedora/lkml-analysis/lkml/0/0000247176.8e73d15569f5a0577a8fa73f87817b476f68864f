CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#75: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/io_apic.c:1970:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#77: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/io_apic.c:1972:
+ * This function currently is only a helper for the i386 smp boot process where $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#97: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/io_apic.c:1992:

+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#119: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/hw_irq.h:104:
+extern void setup_ioapic_dest(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
