ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#58: FILE: drivers/acpi/ibm_acpi.c:566:
	return 0;

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#87: FILE: drivers/acpi/ibm_acpi.c:594:
+	if (!wan_supported)
[...]
+	else if (!(status & 1))
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
