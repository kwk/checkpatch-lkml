WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'corectly' may be misspelled - perhaps 'correctly'?
#41: 
Whose fault? Kernels; it fails to corectly report not enough address
                                  ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#65: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:89:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '!=' (ctx:VxV)
#67: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:91:

 	         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#67: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:91:
+	if (error!=start) {
+		return error;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
