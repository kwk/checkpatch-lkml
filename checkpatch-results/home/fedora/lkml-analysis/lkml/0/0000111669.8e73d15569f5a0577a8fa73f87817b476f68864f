#58: 
Ok, I all (cpu_max/min/cur_freq) assigned it after setting, this should be OK?

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#85: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_userspace.c:34:
*/

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'cpufreq_set', this function's name, in a string
#101: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_userspace.c:70:
+	dprintk("cpufreq_set for cpu %u, freq %u kHz\n", policy->cpu, freq);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#162: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_userspace.c:158:
+		dprintk("limit event for cpu %u: %u - %u kHz,"
+			"currently %u kHz, last set to %u kHz\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#181: FILE: drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_userspace.c:169:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
