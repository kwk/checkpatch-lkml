CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#47: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_driver.c:427:
+		if (ret) {
[...]
+		else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#49: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_driver.c:429:
+			dev_info(&pdev->dev, "pci_set_dma_mask unit %u "
+				 "fails: %d\n", dd->ipath_unit, ret);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#52: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_driver.c:432:
+		}
+		else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
