ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#54: FILE: drivers/video/radeonfb.c:682:
+static char noaccel = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#72: FILE: drivers/video/radeonfb.c:1782:
+        int accel = (mode->accel_flags & FB_ACCELF_TEXT) != 0;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#72: FILE: drivers/video/radeonfb.c:1782:
+        int accel = (mode->accel_flags & FB_ACCELF_TEXT) != 0;$

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#81: FILE: drivers/video/radeonfb.c:1879:
+	if (accel) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
