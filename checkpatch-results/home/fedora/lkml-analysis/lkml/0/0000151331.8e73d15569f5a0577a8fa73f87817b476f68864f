Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#171: FILE: drivers/hwmon/hdaps.c:114:
+	udelay(200);

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/timers/timers-howto.html#delays-information-on-the-various-kernel-delay-sleep-mechanisms

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#245: FILE: drivers/hwmon/hdaps.c:175:
+^I*y = inw(port2);^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'axises' may be misspelled - perhaps 'axes'?

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#428: FILE: drivers/hwmon/hdaps.c:323:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
