ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#49: 
--- a/drivers/pci/hotplug/acpiphp.h	Fri Mar 19 15:21:31 2004

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#56: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/acpiphp.h:238:
+extern void acpiphp_unconfigure_function (struct acpiphp_func *func);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#76: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/acpiphp_glue.c:703:
+			} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
