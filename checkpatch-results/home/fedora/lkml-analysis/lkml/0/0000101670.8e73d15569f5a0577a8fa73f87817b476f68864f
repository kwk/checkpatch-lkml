CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Xgt_desc_struct>
#65: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:22:
+DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct Xgt_desc_struct, cpu_gdt_descr);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#89: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:588:
+	 * CPUs, when bootmem will have gone away */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_crit([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_crit(dev, ... then pr_crit(...  to printk(KERN_CRIT ...

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#98: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:597:
+			for (;;) local_irq_enable();

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#112: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:614:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation
