CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <numBoards>
#44: FILE: drivers/char/moxa.c:296:
+	int i, numBoards;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:ARRAY_SIZE: Prefer ARRAY_SIZE(moxa_pcibrds)
#53: FILE: drivers/char/moxa.c:414:
+		int n = (sizeof(moxa_pcibrds) / sizeof(moxa_pcibrds[0])) - 1;

The ARRAY_SIZE(foo) macro should be preferred over
sizeof(foo)/sizeof(foo[0]) for finding number of elements in an
array.

The macro is defined in include/linux/kernel.h::

  #define ARRAY_SIZE(x) (sizeof(x) / sizeof((x)[0]))

WARNING:ARRAY_SIZE: Prefer ARRAY_SIZE(mxser_pcibrds)
#82: FILE: drivers/char/mxser.c:603:
+		int n = (sizeof(mxser_pcibrds) / sizeof(mxser_pcibrds[0])) - 1;
