ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#56: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2010:
+	if (blocksize != inode->i_sb->s_blocksize)

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'inode->i_sb->s_blocksize < blocksize'
#58: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2012:
+		if ((inode->i_sb->s_blocksize < blocksize) ||
+		    ((inode->i_sb->s_blocksize % blocksize) != 0))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#60: FILE: fs/buffer.c:2014:
+			BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
