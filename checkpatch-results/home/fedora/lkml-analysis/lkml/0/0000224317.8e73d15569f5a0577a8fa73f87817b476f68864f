Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#88: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/vm86.c:723:
+ /* Next line would be required to handle correctly level activated 
+ disable_irq(intno);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
