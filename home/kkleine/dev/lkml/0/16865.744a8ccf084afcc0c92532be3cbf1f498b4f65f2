ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'synchronize_sched', prefer 'synchronize_rcu' instead

+	synchronize_sched();

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.
