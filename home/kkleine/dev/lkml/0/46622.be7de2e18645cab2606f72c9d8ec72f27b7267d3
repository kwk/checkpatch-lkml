WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#36: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#41: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/hcp_phyp.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#98: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/hcp_phyp.c:58:
+	iounmap((volatile void __iomem*)mapaddr);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

+	EDEB(7, "paddr_kernel=%lx paddr_user=%lx galpas->kernel=%lx"

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#129: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/hcp_phyp.c:89:
+	galpas->user.fw_handle = galpas->kernel.fw_handle = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
