CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#239: FILE: include/linux/timex.h:309:
+extern u64 current_tick_length(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#380: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1071:
+	if (error > interval) {
[...]
+	} else if (error < -interval) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
