Many struct inode_operations in the kernel can be "const". Marking them const

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

#912: FILE: include/linux/proc_fs.h:58:
+	const struct inode_operations * proc_iops;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
