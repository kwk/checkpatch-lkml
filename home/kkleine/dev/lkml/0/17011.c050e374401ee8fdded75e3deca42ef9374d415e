WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#36: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .3
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#401: FILE: drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c:4716:
+	if (netif_running(netdev) && (ret_val = e1000_request_irq(adapter)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#443: FILE: drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c:1737:
+	{ USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, 0x0215, HID_QUIRK_POWERBOOK_HAS_FN | HID_QUIRK_POWERBOOK_ISO_KEYBOARD},

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.

distractions when editing files.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#697: FILE: fs/cifs/inode.c:889:
+			/* else rc is still EEXIST so will fall through to

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#698: FILE: fs/cifs/inode.c:890:
+			/* else rc is still EEXIST so will fall through to
+			   unlink the target and retry rename */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __packed over __attribute__((packed))
#783: FILE: include/linux/ufs_fs.h:903:
+		} __attribute__ ((packed)) fs_u2;

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#796: FILE: mm/migrate.c:953:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
