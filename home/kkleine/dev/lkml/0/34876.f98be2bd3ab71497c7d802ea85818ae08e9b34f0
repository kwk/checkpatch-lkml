ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#63: FILE: drivers/base/class.c:889:
+		static struct kobject *virtual_dir = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dev->class'
#85: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:382:
+	if ((dev->class) && (dev->parent == NULL)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dev->parent == NULL'
#85: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:382:
+	if ((dev->class) && (dev->parent == NULL)) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev->parent"
#85: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:382:
+	if ((dev->class) && (dev->parent == NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Error>
#88: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:385:
+			goto Error;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#119: FILE: include/linux/device.h:404:
+extern int virtual_device_parent(struct device *dev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
