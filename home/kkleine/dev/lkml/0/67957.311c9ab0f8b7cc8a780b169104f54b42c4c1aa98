ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#64: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:202:
+	unsigned long (*nopfn)(struct vm_area_struct * area, unsigned long address);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
