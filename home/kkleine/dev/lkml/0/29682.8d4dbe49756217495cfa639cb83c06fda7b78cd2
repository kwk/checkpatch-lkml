#27:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'introdusing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'introducing'?
#29: 
problem by introdusing a pointer to associated address space to buffer_head.
           ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#92: FILE: include/linux/buffer_head.h:71:
+	struct address_space *b_assoc_map;	/* mapping this buffer is

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
