CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dev->class'
#68: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:422:
+	if ((dev->class) && (parent == NULL)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'parent == NULL'

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#68: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:422:
+	if ((dev->class) && (parent == NULL)) {
[...]
+	} else if (parent)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!parent"
#68: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:422:
+	if ((dev->class) && (parent == NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Error>

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#119: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:512:
+		 * symlink from the class to the device. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
