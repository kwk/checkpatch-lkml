The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#208: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:870:
+			int cleaned = page_mkclean(page);
+			if (!must_clean_ptes && cleaned)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
