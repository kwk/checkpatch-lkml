WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#72: FILE: kernel/sched.c:470:
 				seq_printf(seq, " %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu"
+				    " %lu %lu",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#115: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2304:
+			if (local_group) {
[...]
-			else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#175: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2605:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
