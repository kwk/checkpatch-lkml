CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/topology.h> instead of <asm/topology.h>
#95: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/smpboot.c:62:
+#include <asm/topology.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.
