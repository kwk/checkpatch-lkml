WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#28: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#217: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/ds2490.c:126:
+struct ds_device
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#301: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/ds2490.c:195:
 }
+#if 0

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:IF_0: Consider removing the code enclosed by this #if 0 and its #endif

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#410: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/ds2490.c:645:
+static int ds_search(struct ds_device *dev, u64 init, u64 *buf, u8 id_number, int conditional_search)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*dev)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct ds_device)...)
#554: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/ds2490.c:836:
+	dev = kmalloc(sizeof(struct ds_device), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bInterfaceNumber>
#571: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/ds2490.c:850:
+	err = usb_set_interface(dev->udev, intf->altsetting[0].desc.bInterfaceNumber, 3);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#607: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/ds2490.c:877:
+		dev->ep[i+1] = endpoint->bEndpointAddress;
 		         ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <bEndpointAddress>
#607: FILE: drivers/w1/masters/ds2490.c:877:
+		dev->ep[i+1] = endpoint->bEndpointAddress;

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
