CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*rq)...) over kzalloc(sizeof (struct request)...)

+	rq = kzalloc (sizeof (struct request), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
