WARNING:INLINE: plain inline is preferred over __inline__
#65: FILE: net/netlink/af_netlink.c:202:
+__inline__ struct sock *netlink_lookup(int protocol, u32 pid)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#84: FILE: net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1182:

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#92: FILE: net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1792:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(netlink_lookup);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#135: FILE: include/linux/netlink.h:153:
+extern struct sock *netlink_lookup(int protocol, __u32 pid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#148: FILE: net/compat.c:173:
+		kcmsg_base = kcmsg = sock_kmalloc(sk, kcmlen, sk->sk_allocation);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
