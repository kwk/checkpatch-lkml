CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#89: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:61:
+extern int disable_nonboot_cpus(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#138: FILE: kernel/power/smp.c:47:
+		BUG_ON(num_online_cpus() > 1);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
