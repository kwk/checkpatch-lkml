ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#45: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_sis.c:860:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#45: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_sis.c:860:
 	static struct sis_chipset sis_chipsets[] = {
+	

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
