WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#76: FILE: arch/arm/mm/fault.c:233:
+	if (in_atomic() || !mm || current->pagefault_disabled)

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#184: FILE: include/linux/uaccess.h:11:
+extern void pagefault_disable(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
