CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#186: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/proto.h:95:
+extern void early_quirks(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#195: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/early-quirks.c:1:
+/* Various workarounds for chipset bugs.

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

#196: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/early-quirks.c:2:
+/* Various workarounds for chipset bugs.
+   This code runs very early and can't use the regular PCI subsystem

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#254: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/early-quirks.c:60:

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
