ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#58: FILE: arch/powerpc/lib/rheap.c:426:
+void *rh_alloc_align(rh_info_t * info, int size, int alignment, const char *owner)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
