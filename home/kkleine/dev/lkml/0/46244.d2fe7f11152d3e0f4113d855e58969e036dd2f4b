CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#34: FILE: drivers/block/aoe/aoe.h:87:
+	DEVFL_KICKME = (1<<8),
 	                 ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#68: FILE: drivers/block/aoe/aoecmd.c:172:
+^Iif (skb == NULL)^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!skb"
#68: FILE: drivers/block/aoe/aoecmd.c:172:
+	if (skb == NULL)	

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
