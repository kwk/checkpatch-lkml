#81: FILE: drivers/ata/Kconfig:485:
+config PATA_PLATFORM
+	tristate "Generic platform device PATA support"
+	depends on EMBEDDED

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#106: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#111: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_platform.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#151: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_platform.c:41:
+			dev->pio_mode = dev->xfer_mode = XFER_PIO_0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
