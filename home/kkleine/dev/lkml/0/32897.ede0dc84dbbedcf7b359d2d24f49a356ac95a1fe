Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#128: FILE: scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/checklist.c:175:
+^I         dlg.menubox_border.atr, dlg.menubox.atr);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#133: 
deleted file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dlg.backtitle"
#470: FILE: scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/lxdialog.c:81:
+			if (dlg.backtitle != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'dialog' - possible side-effects?

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#782: FILE: scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/util.c:101:
+	static int pair = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#865: FILE: scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/util.c:149:
+	if (has_colors()) {	/* Terminal supports color? */
[...]
+	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#870: FILE: scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/util.c:154:
+	else
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#870: FILE: scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/util.c:154:
+	}
+	else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
