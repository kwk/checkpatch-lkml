WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#63: 
We currently insert sockets/pipes dentries into the global dentry hashtable.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#115: FILE: fs/dcache.c:80:
+	struct dentry * dentry = container_of(head, struct dentry, d_u.d_rcu);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#116: FILE: fs/dcache.c:81:
+	struct dentry * dentry = container_of(head, struct dentry, d_u.d_rcu);
+	__d_free(dentry);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dentry->d_hash.pprev"
#128: FILE: fs/dcache.c:93:
+	if (dentry->d_hash.pprev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:NETWORKING_BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: networking block comments don't use an empty /* line, use /* Comment...

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
