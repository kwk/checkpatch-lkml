#29: 
Description: Check the return value of kmalloc() in function setup_cpu_cache(), in file mm/slab.c.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#41: FILE: mm/slab.c:2024:
+		BUG_ON(!cachep->array[smp_processor_id()]);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
