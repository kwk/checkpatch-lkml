WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#35: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#40: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#41: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:2:
+ * kernel/power/suspend_file.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#46: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:7:
+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#100: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:61:
+static int used_devt = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#101: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:62:
+static int setting_filewriter_target = 0;

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#102: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:63:

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#104: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:65:

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: static char array declaration should probably be static const char
#106: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:67:

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <HaveImage>
#106: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:67:
+static char HaveImage[] = "HaveImage\n";

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:STATIC_CONST_CHAR_ARRAY: static char array declaration should probably be static const char
#107: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:68:
+static char NoImage[] =   "Suspend2\n";

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <NoImage>
#107: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:68:

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#116: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:77:
+extern dev_t ROOT_DEV;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#117: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:78:
+extern char *__initdata root_device_name;
