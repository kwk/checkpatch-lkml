WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#96: FILE: drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:27:
+__module_param_call("", pci_multithread_probe, param_set_bool, param_get_bool, &pci_multithread_probe, 0644);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
