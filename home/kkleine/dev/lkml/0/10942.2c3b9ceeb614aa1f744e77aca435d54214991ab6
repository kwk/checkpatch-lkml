ERROR:IN_ATOMIC: do not use in_atomic in drivers
#63: FILE: drivers/char/isicom.c:234:
+	unsigned int a = in_atomic(); /* do we run under spinlock? */

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.
