WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'set_standard', this function's name, in a string

+		   "i2c v4l2 set_standard(0x%llx)",(long long unsigned)vs);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
