CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'pdev->device == 0x6145'

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#80: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_marvell.c:190:
+		if (mmio_base == NULL) {
+			return -ENOMEM;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mmio_base"
#80: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_marvell.c:190:
+		if (mmio_base == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#85: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_marvell.c:195:
+		(void) readl(mmio_base + 0x04);	/* flush */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
