Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct nlm_host *' should also have an identifier name
#267: FILE: include/linux/lockd/lockd.h:167:
+void		  nlmclnt_recovery(struct nlm_host *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#276: FILE: include/linux/lockd/lockd.h:182:
+extern void	  nlm_host_rebooted(const struct sockaddr_in *, const char *, int, u32);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
