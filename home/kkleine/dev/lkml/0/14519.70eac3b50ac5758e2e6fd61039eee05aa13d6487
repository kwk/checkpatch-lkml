#33: 
Fix issues in the ib_cm regarding support for path migration over infiniband.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#202: FILE: drivers/infiniband/core/cm.c:3109:
+	if (cm_id->state == IB_CM_ESTABLISHED &&
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#207: FILE: drivers/infiniband/core/cm.c:3114:
+	} else

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#314: FILE: drivers/infiniband/core/ucm.c:703:
+	result = ib_cm_notify(ctx->cm_id, (enum ib_event_type) cmd.event);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
