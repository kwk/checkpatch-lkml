Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
