ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#83: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1933:
+static inline void take_selinux_option(char **to, char *from, int *first, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#84: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1934:
+^I^I                       int len)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#84: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1934:

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#88: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1938:
+	if (!*first) {
[...]
+	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#92: FILE: security/selinux/hooks.c:1942:
+	}
+	else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
