#26: 
Add a bugcheck for Andrea's pagefault vs invalidate race. This is triggerable

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#41: FILE: mm/filemap.c:124:
+	BUG_ON(page_mapped(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
