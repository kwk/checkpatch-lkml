#35: 
nfsd read requests can be out of order, concurrent and with no ra-state info.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#76: FILE: fs/nfsd/vfs.c:856:
+	if (prefer_adaptive_readahead()) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

+	} else

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#90: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:745:
+#define RA_FLAG_NFSD	(1UL<<27) /* nfsd read */
                     	    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#90: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:745:
+#define RA_FLAG_NFSD	(1UL<<27) /* nfsd read */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

+		unsigned long hit_rate = max(readahead_hit_rate, 1);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
