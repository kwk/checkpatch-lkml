CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#167: FILE: fs/bio.c:1212:

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 116 exceeds 100 columns
#177: FILE: fs/bio.c:1221:
+	bio_slab = kmem_cache_create("bio", sizeof(struct bio) + sizeof(struct bio_vec), 0, SLAB_PANIC, NULL, NULL);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
