WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#200: FILE: drivers/char/watchdog/rm9k_wdt.c:98:
+static struct file_operations fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#218: FILE: drivers/char/watchdog/rm9k_wdt.c:116:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
