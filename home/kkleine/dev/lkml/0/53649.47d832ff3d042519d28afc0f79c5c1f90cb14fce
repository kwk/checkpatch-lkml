WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 112 exceeds 100 columns
#43: FILE: scripts/hdrcheck.sh:3:
+for FILE in `grep '^[ 	]*#[ 	]*include[ 	]*<' $2 | cut -f2 -d\< | cut -f1 -d\> | egrep ^linux\|^asm` ; do

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
