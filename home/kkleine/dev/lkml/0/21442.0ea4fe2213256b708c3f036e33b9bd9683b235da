CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'brdp->iobase == 0'
#81: FILE: drivers/char/istallion.c:3278:
+	if ((brdp->iobase == 0) || (brdp->memaddr == 0)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!brdp->membase"
#113: FILE: drivers/char/istallion.c:3362:
+	if (brdp->membase == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
