CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#232: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd_int.h:516:
+extern void dasd_blkq_profiling(struct dasd_ccw_req *cqr, int complete);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
