WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'

 		}
+		else {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#46: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_driver.c:433:
+		else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#51: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_driver.c:438:
+				dev_info(&pdev->dev,
+					"Unable to set DMA consistent mask "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#52: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_driver.c:439:
+					"Unable to set DMA consistent mask "
+					"for unit %u: %d\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
