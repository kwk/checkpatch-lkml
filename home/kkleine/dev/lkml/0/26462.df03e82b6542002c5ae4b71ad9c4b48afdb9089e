ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#880: FILE: arch/arm/mach-realview/core.c:478:
+unsigned long realview_gettimeoffset(void)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#914: FILE: arch/arm/mach-realview/localtimer.c:30:
+extern unsigned long realview_gettimeoffset(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
