WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring
#163: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1525:

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#163: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1525:
+							else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#164: FILE: drivers/md/raid1.c:1526:
+								atomic_add(s, &rdev->corrected_errors);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
