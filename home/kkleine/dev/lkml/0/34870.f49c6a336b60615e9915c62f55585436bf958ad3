WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#66: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:222:
+	int i;
+	if (dev->groups) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#67: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:223:
+		for (i = 0; dev->groups[i]; i++) {
+			sysfs_remove_group(&dev->kobj, dev->groups[i]);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#80: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:382:
+	if ((error = device_add_groups(dev)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <GroupError>
#81: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:383:
+		goto GroupError;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
