#39: 
The approach seems sane to me.  Sort-of direct, specific and transactional..

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#44: 
--- a/kernel/cpu.c~define-and-use-new-eventscpu_lock_acquire-and-cpu_lock_release-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
