Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#740: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.c:3680:
+static int has_panicked = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#1161: FILE: drivers/scsi/NCR5380.c:503:
+ * Purpose : decide whether a command would normally disconnect or $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'AscInitFromEEP', this function's name, in a string
#1174: FILE: drivers/scsi/advansys.c:12377:
+                ASC_PRINT("AscInitFromEEP: Successfully re-wrote EEPROM.\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

#1341: FILE: drivers/usb/storage/usb.h:163:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
