CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#47: FILE: include/asm-m68k/sun3mmu.h:164:
+extern void __iomem *sun3_ioremap(unsigned long phys, unsigned long size,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#48: FILE: include/asm-m68k/sun3mmu.h:165:
+extern void __iomem *sun3_ioremap(unsigned long phys, unsigned long size,
 			  unsigned long type);
