required. To proceed, lets look into ->proc_fops values during and after PDE

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#210: FILE: include/linux/proc_fs.h:70:
+				 * ->read_proc, ->write_proc, ->get_info */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
