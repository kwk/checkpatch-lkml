CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cmd->data != NULL'
#53: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:479:
+	if ((cmd->data != NULL) || (cmd->flags & MMC_RSP_BUSY))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "cmd->data"
#53: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:479:
+	if ((cmd->data != NULL) || (cmd->flags & MMC_RSP_BUSY))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#57: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:483:
+	/* We shouldn't wait for data inihibit for stop commands, even
+	   though they might use busy signaling */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cmd == host->mrq->data->stop'
#58: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:484:
+	if (host->mrq->data && (cmd == host->mrq->data->stop))

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#65: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:490:
 			printk(KERN_ERR "%s: Controller never released "
+				"inhibit bit(s). Please report this to "

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
