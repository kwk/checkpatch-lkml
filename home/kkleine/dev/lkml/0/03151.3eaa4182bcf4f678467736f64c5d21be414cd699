The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#75: FILE: arch/um/kernel/time.c:62:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'

 	}
+	else prev_nsecs[c] = os_nsecs();

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
