WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#46: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_block_io.c:928:
+	BUG_ON(!suspend_writer_posn.current_extent);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#50: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_block_io.c:932:
+	readahead_index = readahead_submit_index = -1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
