WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#62: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/irq.c:138:
+    (void (*)(irqreturn_t (*)(int, void *))) irq_panic;$

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#398: FILE: drivers/parport/parport_sunbpp.c:51:
+	parport_generic_irq(irq, (struct parport *) dev_id);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#426: FILE: include/asm-sparc/irq.h:80:
+extern void claim_ticker14(irqreturn_t (*irq_handler)(int, void *),

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 129 exceeds 100 columns
#435: FILE: include/asm-sparc/irq.h:94:
+extern int request_fast_irq(unsigned int irq, irqreturn_t (*handler)(int, void *), unsigned long flags, __const__ char *devname);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#440: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#445: FILE: include/asm-sparc/irq_regs.h:1:
+#include <asm-generic/irq_regs.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
