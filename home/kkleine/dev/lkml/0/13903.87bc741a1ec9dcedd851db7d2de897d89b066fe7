+/* The dlm_ls_start() that created the rv we take here may already have been
+   stopped via dlm_ls_stop(); in that case we need to leave the RECOVERY_STOP

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
