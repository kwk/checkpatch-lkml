CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#71: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:319:
+extern const char *handle_irq_name(irq_flow_handler_t handle);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
