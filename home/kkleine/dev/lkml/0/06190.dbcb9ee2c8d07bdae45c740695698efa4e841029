WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#58: FILE: fs/aio.c:722:
+	BUG_ON(!is_sync_wait(current->io_wait));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#84: FILE: fs/aio.c:1523:
+	struct wait_bit_queue *wait_bit
+		= container_of(wait, struct wait_bit_queue, wait);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#101: FILE: fs/aio.c:1585:
+ ^Ireq->ki_run_list.next = req->ki_run_list.prev = NULL;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#101: FILE: fs/aio.c:1585:
+ ^Ireq->ki_run_list.next = req->ki_run_list.prev = NULL;$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#101: FILE: fs/aio.c:1585:
+ ^Ireq->ki_run_list.next = req->ki_run_list.prev = NULL;$

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#101: FILE: fs/aio.c:1585:
+ 	req->ki_run_list.next = req->ki_run_list.prev = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
