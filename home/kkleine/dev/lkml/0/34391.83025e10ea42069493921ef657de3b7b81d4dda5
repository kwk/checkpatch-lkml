CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#43: FILE: include/linux/genalloc.h:33:
+extern void gen_pool_destroy(struct gen_pool *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct gen_pool *' should also have an identifier name
#43: FILE: include/linux/genalloc.h:33:
+extern void gen_pool_destroy(struct gen_pool *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#56: FILE: lib/genalloc.c:40:
+ * actual memory managed by the pool.  $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:RETURN_VOID: void function return statements are not generally useful
#72: FILE: lib/genalloc.c:56:
+	return;
+}

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#75: FILE: lib/genalloc.c:59:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
