ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#112: FILE: fs/libfs.c:364:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+	 * well above the highest value that iunique_register will assign to an inode */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#160: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1893:
+extern int simple_fill_super(struct super_block *, int, struct tree_descr *, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct super_block *' should also have an identifier name
#160: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1893:
+extern int simple_fill_super(struct super_block *, int, struct tree_descr *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
