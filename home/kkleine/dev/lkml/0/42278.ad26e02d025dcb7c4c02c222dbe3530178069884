WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#46: FILE: fs/gfs2/locking/nolock/main.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#82: FILE: fs/gfs2/locking/nolock/main.c:37:
+	if (!c)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*nl)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct nolock_lockspace)...)
#89: FILE: fs/gfs2/locking/nolock/main.c:44:
+	nl = kzalloc(sizeof(struct nolock_lockspace), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#112: FILE: fs/gfs2/locking/nolock/main.c:67:
+	struct nolock_lockspace *nl = (struct nolock_lockspace *)lockspace;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

It is generally desirable that building the same source code with
the same set of tools is reproducible, i.e. the output is always
exactly the same.

The kernel does *not* use the ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros,
and enables warnings if they are used as they can lead to
non-deterministic builds.
