ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#61: FILE: net/sched/act_police.c:51:
+struct tc_police_compat
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
