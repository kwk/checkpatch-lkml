#33: 
Added config-struct-parameter to take board-specific AGC command 1 and 2 into account.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 123 exceeds 100 columns
#92: FILE: drivers/media/dvb/frontends/dib3000mc.c:348:
+	dib3000mc_write_word(state, 37, (state->cfg->agc_command1 << 13) | (state->cfg->agc_command2 << 12) | (0x1d << 0));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
