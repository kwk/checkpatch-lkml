WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#17: 
Subject: Sparse minor space in ub

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

a thought occured to me. If floppy ever returns NULL from its match
          ^^^^^^^

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'accomodate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'accommodate'?
#77: 
done to accomodate md. The md_probe() always returns NULL, and
        ^^^^^^^^^^

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#433: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:980:
+	unsigned (*partmap)(struct gendisk *, int partno);

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct gendisk *' should also have an identifier name
#433: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:980:
+	unsigned (*partmap)(struct gendisk *, int partno);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
