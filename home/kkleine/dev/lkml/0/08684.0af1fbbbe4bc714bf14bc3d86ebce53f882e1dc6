CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#60: FILE: include/linux/memory_hotplug.h:136:
+extern int under_memory_hotadd(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - int under_memory_hotadd() should probably be int under_memory_hotadd(void)
#71: FILE: include/linux/memory_hotplug.h:166:
+static inline int under_memory_hotadd()

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)
