ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:USE_DEVICE_INITCALL: please use device_initcall() or more appropriate function instead of __initcall() (see include/linux/init.h)

+__initcall(flush_files_init);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:184:
+extern int schedule_on_each_cpu_wq(struct workqueue_struct *wq, work_func_t func);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#145: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:740:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
