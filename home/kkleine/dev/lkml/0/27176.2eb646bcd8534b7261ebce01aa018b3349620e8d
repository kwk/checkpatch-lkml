WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#101: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_diag.c:74:
+static struct file_operations diagpkt_file_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
