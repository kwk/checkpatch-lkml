#40: 
instruction slot where icache content is inconsistent with dcache.This patch

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#100: FILE: include/asm-ia64/kprobes.h:127:
+extern void flush_insn_slot(struct kprobe *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
