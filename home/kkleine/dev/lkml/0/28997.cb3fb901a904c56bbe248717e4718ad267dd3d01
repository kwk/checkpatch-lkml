WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#72: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/numa.c:35:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#78: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/numa.c:41:
+	if (cpu_isset(cpu, node_to_cpu_mask[oldnid])) {
+		return; /* nothing to do */
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#82: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/numa.c:45:
+	/* we don't have cpu-driven node hot add yet...
+	   In usual case, node is created from SRAT at boot time. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
