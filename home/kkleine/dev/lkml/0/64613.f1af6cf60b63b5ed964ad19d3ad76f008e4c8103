WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#33: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#38: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#44: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:7:
+ * $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#78: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:41:
+        unsigned long address;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#94: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:57:
+extern asmlinkage long sys_swapon(const char *specialfile, int swap_flags);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#95: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:58:
+extern asmlinkage long sys_swapoff(const char *specialfile);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#113: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:76:
+struct bdev_opened
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
