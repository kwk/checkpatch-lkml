+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#174: FILE: include/linux/serial_pnx8xxx.h:46:
+#define PNX8XXX_UART_LCR_TXBREAK	(1<<30)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
