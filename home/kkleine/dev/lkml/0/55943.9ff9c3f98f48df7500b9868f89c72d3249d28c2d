WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#113: FILE: fs/revoke.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#114: FILE: fs/revoke.c:2:
+ * fs/revoke.c - Invalidate all current open file descriptors of an inode.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#136: FILE: fs/revoke.c:24:

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#200: FILE: fs/revoke.c:88:
+static struct vm_operations_struct revoked_vm_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#201: FILE: fs/revoke.c:89:
+        .nopage         = revoked_nopage,$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#201: FILE: fs/revoke.c:89:
+        .nopage         = revoked_nopage,$

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#218: FILE: fs/revoke.c:106:
+	/* FIXME: If we fail to invalidate some pages, no one will take them
+	   down but subsequent revoke operations succeed... */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting
