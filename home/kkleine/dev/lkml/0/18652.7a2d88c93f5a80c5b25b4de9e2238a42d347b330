ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#322: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/cio.h:140:
+extern spinlock_t * cio_get_console_lock(void);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#322: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/cio.h:140:
+extern spinlock_t * cio_get_console_lock(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#326: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/cio.h:144:
+#define cio_get_console_lock() NULL;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
