+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#185: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2979:

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...

#185: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:2979:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
