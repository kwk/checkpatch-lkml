#36: 
Since I have no s390 machine, I didn't compile it but I examined it carefully.

+	ch = kzalloc(sizeof (struct channel), GFP_KERNEL);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*ch)...) over kzalloc(sizeof (struct channel)...)
#51: FILE: drivers/s390/net/ctcmain.c:1642:
+	ch = kzalloc(sizeof (struct channel), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
