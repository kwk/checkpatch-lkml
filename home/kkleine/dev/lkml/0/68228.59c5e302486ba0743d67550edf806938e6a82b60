#102: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1022:
+int set_cpu_rate_cap(struct task_struct *, unsigned int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

#139: FILE: kernel/Kconfig.caps:5:
+config CPU_RATE_CAPS
+	bool "Support (soft) CPU rate caps"
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  Say y here if you wish to be able to put a (soft) upper limit on
+	  the rate of CPU usage by individual tasks.  A task which has been
+	  allocated a soft CPU rate cap will be limited to that rate of CPU
+	  usage unless there is spare CPU resources available after the needs
+	  of uncapped tasks are met.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#643: FILE: kernel/sched.c:4106:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
