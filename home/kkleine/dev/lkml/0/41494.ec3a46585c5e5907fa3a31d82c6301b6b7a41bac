Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#63: FILE: arch/parisc/kernel/setup.c:48:
__read_mostly;

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#102: FILE: arch/parisc/mm/init.c:80:
+	extern char __initdata boot_command_line[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
