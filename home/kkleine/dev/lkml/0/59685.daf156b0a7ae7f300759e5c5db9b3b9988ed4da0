#39: 
3. Replace the use of ZONE_HIGHMEM with MAX_NR_ZONES in build_zonelists_node

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#85: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1445:
+	BUG_ON(zone_type >= MAX_NR_ZONES);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
