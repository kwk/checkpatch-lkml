  update struct pid, because of the strange locking used in the SAK processing.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#211: FILE: include/linux/console_struct.h:115:
+extern void vc_SAK(struct work_struct *work);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
