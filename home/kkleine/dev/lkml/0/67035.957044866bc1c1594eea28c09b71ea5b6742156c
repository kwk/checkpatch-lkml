> I agree in theory.  In practice however msi interrupts look like io_apics.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#112: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/intrvec.c:33:
+int offset = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'vector >= FIRST_DEVICE_VECTOR'
#116: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/intrvec.c:37:
+	if ((vector >= FIRST_DEVICE_VECTOR) && (vector < FIRST_SYSTEM_VECTOR))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

#130: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/intrvec.c:51:

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#195: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:98:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
