CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/linux/spinlock.h:269:
+extern int _atomic_dec_and_lock_irqsave(atomic_t *atomic, spinlock_t *lock,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
