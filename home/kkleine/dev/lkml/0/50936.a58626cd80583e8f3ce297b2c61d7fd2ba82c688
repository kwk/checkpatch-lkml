ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#46: FILE: drivers/hwmon/hdaps.c:354:
+static void hdaps_device_shutdown(void) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
