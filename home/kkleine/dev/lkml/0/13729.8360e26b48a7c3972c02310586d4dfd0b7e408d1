Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#188: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/sgi_hotplug.c:417:
+	 * Add the slot's devices to the ACPI infrastructure */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rethandle"
#217: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/sgi_hotplug.c:446:
+			if (ret == AE_NOT_FOUND || rethandle == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '>>' (ctx:VxV)
#226: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/sgi_hotplug.c:455:
+			    (adr>>16) == (slot->device_num + 1)) {
 			        ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#227: FILE: drivers/pci/hotplug/sgi_hotplug.c:456:
+			    (adr>>16) == (slot->device_num + 1)) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
