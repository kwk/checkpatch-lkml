CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#46: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/e820.h:49:
+extern unsigned long e820_hole_size(unsigned long start, unsigned long end);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#68: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/e820.c:199:
+		    ei->addr+ei->size <= start ||
 		            ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#86: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/e820.c:217:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
