WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#58: FILE: fs/proc/root.c:125:
+	struct adaptive_pointer *ap;
+	ap = kzalloc(sizeof(*ap), GFP_KERNEL);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:ENOTSUPP: ENOTSUPP is not a SUSV4 error code, prefer EOPNOTSUPP
#82: FILE: fs/proc/root.c:149:
+	return -ENOTSUPP;

ENOTSUPP is not a standard error code and should be avoided in new patches.
EOPNOTSUPP should be used instead.
