CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#59: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:188:
+extern void update_vsyscall(struct timespec *ts, struct clocksource *c);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#61: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:190:
+#define update_vsyscall(now, c) do { } while(0)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
