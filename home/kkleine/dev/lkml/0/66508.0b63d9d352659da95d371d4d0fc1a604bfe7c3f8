WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#108: FILE: kernel/Kconfig.caps:15:
+config CPU_RATE_HARD_CAPS
+	bool "Support CPU rate hard caps"
+	depends on CPU_RATE_CAPS
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  Say y here if you wish to be able to put a hard upper limit on
+	  the rate of CPU usage by individual tasks.  A task which has been
+	  allocated a hard CPU rate cap will be limited to that rate of CPU
+	  usage regardless of whether there is spare CPU resources available.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#223: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1223:
+	struct task_struct *p = (struct task_struct*)arg;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
