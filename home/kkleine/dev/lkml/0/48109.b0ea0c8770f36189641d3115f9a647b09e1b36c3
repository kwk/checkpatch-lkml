#29: 
The resulting code is more generic and easier to read and has cleaner error 

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#42: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1566:
+extern struct file *create_read_pipe(struct file *f);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#44: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1568:
+extern void free_write_pipe(struct file *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'iput' may be misspelled - perhaps 'input'?
#142: FILE: fs/pipe.c:934:
+	iput(inode);
 	^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#158: FILE: fs/pipe.c:950:
+	struct file *f = get_empty_filp();
+	if (!f)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
