CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#44: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:101:
+		devinfo.bmap_shift = devinfo.blocks_per_page = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
