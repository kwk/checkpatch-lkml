CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#236: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs2xdr.c:435:
+	kaddr = p = kmap_atomic(*page, KM_USER0);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
