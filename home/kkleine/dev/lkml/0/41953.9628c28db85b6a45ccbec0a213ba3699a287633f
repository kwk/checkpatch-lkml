WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#78: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/svc.h:308:
+						 * Only used for nfsacl so far. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!progp->pg_vers[i]"
#110: FILE: net/sunrpc/svc.c:652:
+			if (progp->pg_vers[i] == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'svc_register', this function's name, in a string
#113: FILE: net/sunrpc/svc.c:655:
+			dprintk("RPC: svc_register(%s, %s, %d, %d)%s\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
