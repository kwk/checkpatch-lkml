Subject: sound/pci/hda/intel_hda: small cleanups
                   ^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#128: FILE: sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c:1326:
+		/* FIXME: this should probably use readl or something.
+		   hand-doing volatiles is wrong. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
