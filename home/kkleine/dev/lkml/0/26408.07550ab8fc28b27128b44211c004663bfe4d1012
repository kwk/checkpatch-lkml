WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#60: FILE: fs/nfs/dir.c:206:
+	if (page->index == 0 && invalidate_inode_pages2_range(inode->i_mapping, PAGE_CACHE_SIZE, -1) < 0) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#172: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs.h:293:
+extern void nfs_zap_mapping(struct inode *inode, struct address_space *mapping);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
