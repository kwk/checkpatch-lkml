WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: Do not use whitespace before Signed-off-by:
#125: 
    Signed-off-by: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#205: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:429:
+	int (*flushpage) (struct page *);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#205: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:429:
+	int (*flushpage) (struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:WxV)
#218: FILE: mm/truncate.c:325:
+flush_page(struct struct address_space *mapping, struct page *page)
                                        ^

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!mapping->a_ops->flushpage"
#222: FILE: mm/truncate.c:329:
+	if (page->mapping != mapping || mapping->a_ops->flushpage == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
