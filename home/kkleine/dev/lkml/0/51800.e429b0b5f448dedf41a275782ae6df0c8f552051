WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#131: FILE: drivers/net/tg3.c:362:
+extern void (*tg3_hack_hook)(void); /* defined in kernel/clockevents.c */

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
