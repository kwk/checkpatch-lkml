#24: 
set_interval returns an error instead of panicing if setitimer fails.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#98: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:279:
+extern int set_interval(int is_virtual);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
