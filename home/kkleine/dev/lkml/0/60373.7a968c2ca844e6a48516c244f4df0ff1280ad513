#29: 
This patch changes as much as possible all unsigned ints to size_t in the code 

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#117: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/ecryptfs_kernel.h:127:
+extern void ecryptfs_to_hex(char *dst, char *src, size_t src_size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
