The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#137: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/common.c:199:

#140: FILE: arch/arm/plat-omap/common.c:202:

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#401: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap1/time.c:185:
+	clocksource_mpu.mult
+		= clocksource_khz2mult(rate/1000, clocksource_mpu.shift);

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '/' (ctx:VxV)
#401: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap1/time.c:185:
+		= clocksource_khz2mult(rate/1000, clocksource_mpu.shift);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#433: FILE: arch/arm/mach-omap1/time.c:220:
+	BUG_ON(IS_ERR(ck_ref));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
