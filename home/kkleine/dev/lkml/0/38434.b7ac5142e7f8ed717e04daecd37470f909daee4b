ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* const bar" should be "foo * const bar"
#100: FILE: drivers/hwmon/pc87360.c:815:
+	struct superio* const gate = superio_find(cmd_addrs, DEVID, devid_vals);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
