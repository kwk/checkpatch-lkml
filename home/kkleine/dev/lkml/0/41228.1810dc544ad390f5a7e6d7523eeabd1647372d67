Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
