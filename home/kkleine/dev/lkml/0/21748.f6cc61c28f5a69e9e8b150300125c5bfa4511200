WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#33: 
The MEM_SWAPOUT crashpoint in LKDTM could be broken as some compilers inline the call to shrink_page_list() and symbol lookup for this function name fails.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 136 exceeds 100 columns
#66: FILE: drivers/misc/lkdtm.c:160:
+unsigned long jp_shrink_inactive_list(unsigned long max_scan, struct zone *zone,				struct scan_control *sc)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#77: FILE: drivers/misc/lkdtm.c:300:
+		lkdtm.entry = (kprobe_opcode_t*) jp_shrink_inactive_list;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
