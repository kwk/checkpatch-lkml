WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#61: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'libaries' may be misspelled - perhaps 'libraries'?
#361: FILE: scripts/Kbuild.klibc:296:
+# Do not try to build KLIBC libaries if we are building klibc
                             ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'prequisites' may be misspelled - perhaps 'prerequisites'?
#383: FILE: scripts/Kbuild.klibc:318:
+# Add FORCE to the prequisites of a target to force it to be always rebuilt.
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#420: FILE: scripts/Kbuild.klibc:355:
+# Shorthand for $(Q)$(MAKE) -f scripts/Kbuild.klibc obj

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#423: FILE: scripts/Kbuild.klibc:358:
+klibc := -rR -f $(if $(KBUILD_SRC),$(srctree)/)scripts/Kbuild.klibc obj
