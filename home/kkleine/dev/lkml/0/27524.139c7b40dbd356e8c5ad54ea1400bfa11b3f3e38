However, we should still allow the owner to override permissions in the case

#65: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4proc.c:71:
+do_open_permission(struct svc_rqst *rqstp, struct svc_fh *current_fh, struct nfsd4_open *open, int accmode)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
