+/* _EMIT_BUG_ENTRY expects args %0,%1,%2,%3 to be FILE, LINE, flags and

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#425: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/bug.h:42:
+#define BUG() do {							\

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#430: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/bug.h:47:
+		for(;;) ;						\

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#430: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/bug.h:47:
+		for(;;) ;						\

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#445: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/bug.h:56:
+		"1:	"PPC_TLNEI"	%4,0\n"			\

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");
