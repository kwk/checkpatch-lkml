This is also revised. This fixes the wrong expression at the error handlings in 

WARNING:SIZEOF_PARENTHESIS: sizeof *it should be sizeof(*it)

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#118: FILE: kernel/posix-cpu-timers.c:1481:
+	if (error == -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
