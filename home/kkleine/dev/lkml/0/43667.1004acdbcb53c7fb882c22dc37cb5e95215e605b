ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#154: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/entry.S:151:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#394: FILE: include/asm-i386/mmu_context.h:65:
+#define deactivate_mm(tsk, mm)			\
+	asm("movl %0,%%fs": :"r" (0));

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
