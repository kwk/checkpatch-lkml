Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph

FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#502: FILE: drivers/char/eqnx/sst_ioctl.c:437:
+	if (len > 0) {
+		msleep(jiffies_to_msecs(len));
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
