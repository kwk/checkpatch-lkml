WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'flush_to_ldisc', this function's name, in a string
#57: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2784:
+		printk(KERN_ERR"flush_to_ldisc - TTY_DONT_FLIP set\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#57: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2784:
+		printk(KERN_ERR"flush_to_ldisc - TTY_DONT_FLIP set\n");

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#62: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2789:
+		printk(KERN_ERR"flush_to_ldisc - TTY_FLUSHING set, low_latency=%d\n", tty->low_latency);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
