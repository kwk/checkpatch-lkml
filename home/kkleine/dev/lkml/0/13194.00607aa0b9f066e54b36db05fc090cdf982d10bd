CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#41: FILE: fs/affs/bitmap.c:292:
+	bm = sbi->s_bitmap = kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*server)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct afs_server)...)
#58: FILE: fs/afs/server.c:58:
+	server = kzalloc(sizeof(struct afs_server), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*as)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct afs_super_info)...)
#76: FILE: fs/afs/super.c:245:
+	as = kzalloc(sizeof(struct afs_super_info), GFP_KERNEL);
