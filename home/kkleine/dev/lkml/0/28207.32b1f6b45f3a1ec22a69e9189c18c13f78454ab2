WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'stl_argbrds', this function's name, in a string
#137: FILE: drivers/char/stallion.c:770:
+	pr_debug("stl_argbrds()\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#143: FILE: drivers/char/stallion.c:776:
+		if ((brdp = stl_allocbrd()) == NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
