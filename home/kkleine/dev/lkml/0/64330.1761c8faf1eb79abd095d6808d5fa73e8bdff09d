ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#56: FILE: kernel/power/atomic_copy.c:279:
+	BUG_ON(!irqs_disabled());

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#64: FILE: kernel/power/atomic_copy.c:287:

+			" Only %d growth is allowed for!\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
