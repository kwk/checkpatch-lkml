CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#204: FILE: fs/xfs/quota/xfs_qm.h:183:
+extern bool		xfs_qm_dqalloc_incore(xfs_dquot_t **);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'xfs_dquot_t **' should also have an identifier name
#204: FILE: fs/xfs/quota/xfs_qm.h:183:
+extern bool		xfs_qm_dqalloc_incore(xfs_dquot_t **);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#247: FILE: fs/xfs/quota/xfs_qm_syscalls.c:532:
+	tempuqip = tempgqip = false;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
