#27: 
Loopback files normally contain filesystems, in which case there are already

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#54: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:744:
+#define RA_FLAG_LOOP	(1UL<<28) /* loopback file */
                     	    ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#54: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:744:
+#define RA_FLAG_LOOP	(1UL<<28) /* loopback file */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
