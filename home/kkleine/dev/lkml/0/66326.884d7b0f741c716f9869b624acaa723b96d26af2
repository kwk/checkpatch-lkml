#27: 
[PATCH 3/6] Blacklist PCI-E chipsets depending on Hypertransport MSI capabality

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#57: FILE: drivers/pci/quirks.c:1608:
+ * return 1 if a HT MSI capability is found and enabled */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

+DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_FINAL(PCI_VENDOR_ID_SERVERWORKS, PCI_DEVICE_ID_SERVERWORKS_HT2000_PCIE, quirk_msi_ht_cap);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
