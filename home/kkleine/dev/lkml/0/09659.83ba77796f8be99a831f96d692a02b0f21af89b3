WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#124: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:886:
+	struct address_space *mapping = page_mapping(page);
+	return __test_clear_page_dirty(mapping, page);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#163: FILE: mm/truncate.c:388:
+			} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
