CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/skbuff.h:970:
+extern int ___pskb_trim(struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int len);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h

Do not use assignments in if condition.

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
