CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?

 	                    ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#325: FILE: fs/block_dev.c:1072:
+		if (bdev != bdev->bd_contains) {
+			blkdev_put(bdev->bd_contains);
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#336: FILE: fs/block_dev.c:1083:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(blkdev_put);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
