CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Xgt_desc_struct>
#81: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:592:
+	struct Xgt_desc_struct *cpu_gdt_descr = &per_cpu(cpu_gdt_descr, cpu);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#95: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:606:
+		BUG_ON(gdt != NULL || pda != NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "gdt"
#95: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:606:
+		BUG_ON(gdt != NULL || pda != NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pda"
#95: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:606:
+		BUG_ON(gdt != NULL || pda != NULL);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
