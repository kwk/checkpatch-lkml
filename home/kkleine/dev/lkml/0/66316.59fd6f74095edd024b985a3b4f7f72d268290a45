WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Acked-by:' is the preferred signature form
#70: 
Acked-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#113: FILE: fs/dcache.c:414:
+			int skip = count;
+			while (skip && tmp != &dentry_unused &&

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#114: FILE: fs/dcache.c:415:
+			while (skip && tmp != &dentry_unused &&
+			    list_entry(tmp, struct dentry, d_lru)->d_sb != sb) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dentry->d_sb->s_root"
#153: FILE: fs/dcache.c:471:
+			if (dentry->d_sb->s_root != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#230: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:220:
+extern void shrink_dcache_anon(struct super_block *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct super_block *' should also have an identifier name
#230: FILE: include/linux/dcache.h:220:
+extern void shrink_dcache_anon(struct super_block *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
