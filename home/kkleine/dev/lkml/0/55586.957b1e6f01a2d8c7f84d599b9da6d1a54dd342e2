ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#79: 
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c~synchronize_tsc-fixes

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after tsc_values[NR_CPUS]
#86: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:218:
+static unsigned long long __initdata tsc_values[NR_CPUS];

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
