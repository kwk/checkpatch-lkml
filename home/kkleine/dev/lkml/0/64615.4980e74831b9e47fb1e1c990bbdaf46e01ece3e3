CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#49: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:114:
+	resume_block_device = header_block_device = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
