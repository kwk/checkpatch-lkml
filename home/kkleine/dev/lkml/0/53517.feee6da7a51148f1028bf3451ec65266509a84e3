ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#184: FILE: scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/menubox.c:183:
+                const void *selected, int *s_scroll)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#238: FILE: scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/textbox.c:28:
+static void print_position(WINDOW * win);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
