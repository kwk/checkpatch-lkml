#29: 
Description: A mini HOWTO on implementing a new system call. Although, I think that implementing new system calls is discouraged, many people do end up in implementing proprietary system calls. This HOWTO can help those people, and also those who are inquisitive (like me). Would it be a good idea to include this in the kernel tree, in the Documentation directory? If you feel that this document should be improved before it goes in the tree, please offer me your suggestions.
