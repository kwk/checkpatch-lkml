#41: 
So it's not possible to call down to generic_file_aio_read/write with invalid

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#60: FILE: fs/aio.c:1419:
+	if (unlikely((ssize_t) kiocb->ki_nbytes < 0))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#139: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2215:
+	count = ocount = iocb->ki_left;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
