WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#100: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:62:
+extern u8 apicid_2_node[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#117: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:305:
+	for (i = 0; i < MAX_APICID; i++) {
+		apicid_2_node[i] = pxm_to_nid_map[apicid_to_pxm[i]];
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#120: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:308:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
