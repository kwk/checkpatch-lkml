Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

+^I^I ((unsigned long)pci_iomap(pdev, bar, netdev_io_size) & $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#72: FILE: drivers/net/sundance.c:492:
+^I          0xffffff80);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#76: FILE: drivers/net/sundance.c:496:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
