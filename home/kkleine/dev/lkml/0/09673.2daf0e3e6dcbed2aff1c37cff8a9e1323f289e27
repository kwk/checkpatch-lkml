WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#63: FILE: drivers/video/Kconfig:45:
+config FIRMWARE_EDID
+       bool "Enable firmware EDID"
+       depends on FB
+       default n
+       ---help---
+         This enables access to the EDID transferred from the firmware.
+	 On the i386, this is from the Video BIOS. Enable this if DDC/I2C
+	 transfers do not work for your driver and if you are using
+	 nvidiafb, i810fb or savagefb.
+
+	 In general, choosing Y for this option is safe.  If you
+	 experience extremely long delays while booting before you get
+	 something on your display, try setting this to N.  Matrox cards in
+	 combination with certain motherboards and monitors are known to
+	 suffer from this problem.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
