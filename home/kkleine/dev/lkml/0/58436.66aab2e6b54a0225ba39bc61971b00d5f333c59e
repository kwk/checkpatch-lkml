WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#105: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#110: FILE: drivers/video/fb_notify.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#111: FILE: drivers/video/fb_notify.c:2:
+ *  linux/drivers/video/fb_notify.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#307: FILE: include/linux/fb.h:527:
+extern int fb_notifier_call_chain(unsigned long val, void *v);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
