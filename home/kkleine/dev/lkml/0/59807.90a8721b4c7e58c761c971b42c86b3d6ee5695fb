#31: 
Here's another set of typo fixes for RC1.  They should all be unique from previous patches.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#42: 
--- a/arch/arm/mach-s3c2410/Kconfig	2006-07-06 10:48:48.000000000 -0400

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
