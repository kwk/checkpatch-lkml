WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#55: FILE: fs/fuse/inode.c:42:
+	unsigned blksize;

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "sb->s_bdev"
#102: FILE: fs/fuse/inode.c:513:
+	int is_bdev = sb->s_bdev != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#108: FILE: fs/fuse/inode.c:518:
+	if (!parse_fuse_opt((char *) data, &d, is_bdev))
