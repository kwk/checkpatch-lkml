The proper way to reference a commit id is:
commit <12+ chars of sha1> ("<title line>")

An example may be::

  Commit e21d2170f36602ae2708 ("video: remove unnecessary
  platform_set_drvdata()") removed the unnecessary
  platform_set_drvdata(), but left the variable "dev" unused,
  delete it.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
