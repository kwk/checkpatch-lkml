WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'sbp2util_notify_fetch_agent', this function's name, in a string
#89: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c:491:
+		SBP2_ERR("sbp2util_notify_fetch_agent failed.");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
