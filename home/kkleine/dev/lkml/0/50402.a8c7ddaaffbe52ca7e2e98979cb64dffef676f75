Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'include' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#76: FILE: linux/sched.h:1114:
+extern void __put_task_struct_cb(struct rcu_head *rhp);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix 'kernel' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#119: FILE: fork.c:130:
+	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&tsk->usage));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
