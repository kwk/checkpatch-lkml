ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#120: FILE: security/selinux/ss/mls.c:560:
+^I^I^I^I                     &rtr->target_range);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#177: FILE: security/selinux/ss/policydb.c:1858:
+			if (new_rangetr) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
