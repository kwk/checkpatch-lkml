#31: 
In an effort to avoid the typo patch spam, here's a larger patch to cover many Kconfigs in /drivers.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#43: 
--- a/drivers/firmware/Kconfig	2006-07-04 21:38:30.000000000 -0400

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
