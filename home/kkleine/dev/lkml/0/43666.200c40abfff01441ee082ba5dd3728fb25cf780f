WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after boot_pda
#80: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:612:
+	static const __initdata struct i386_pda boot_pda;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1377655732.3619.19.camel@joe-AO722/

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of const init definition must use __initconst
#80: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:612:
+	static const __initdata struct i386_pda boot_pda;

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.
