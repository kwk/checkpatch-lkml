#36: 
processor.  There is no such "global" function for that in the kernel so far.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#86: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/msr.c:114:
+int msr_read(int cpu, u32 reg, u32 * eax, u32 * edx)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
