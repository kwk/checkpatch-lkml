WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#90: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/cmf.c:120:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#90: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/cmf.c:120:
+	void * (*align) (void *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*set_data)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct set_schib_struct)...)
#143: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/cmf.c:263:
+	set_data = kzalloc(sizeof(struct set_schib_struct), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
