WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#61: FILE: Makefile:771:
+# the Makefile, kernel config options, make command line options and/or

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#68: FILE: Makefile:778:
+#	  $(EXTRAVERSION)		eg, -rc6
