ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#91: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:150:
+	u64 size = mask & maxbase;	/* Find the significant bits */
+	if (!size)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

#95: FILE: drivers/pci/probe.c:154:
+	/* Get the lowest of them to find the decode size, and

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
