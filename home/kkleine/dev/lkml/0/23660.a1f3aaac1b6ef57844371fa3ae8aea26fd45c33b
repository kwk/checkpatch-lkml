Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#92: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:478:
+static int intr_count = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#139: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:845:
+	if(ubd_dev->file == NULL)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ubd_dev->file"
#139: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:845:
+	if(ubd_dev->file == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#141: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:847:
+	return(0);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

WARNING:USE_DEVICE_INITCALL: please use device_initcall() or more appropriate function instead of __initcall() (see include/linux/init.h)
#144: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:850:
+__initcall(ubd0_init);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#162: FILE: arch/um/drivers/ubd_kern.c:886:
+static int __init ubd_driver_init(void){

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
