WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#246: FILE: arch/ia64/mm/init.c:600:
+	BUG_ON(nid == NULL);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!nid"
#246: FILE: arch/ia64/mm/init.c:600:
+	BUG_ON(nid == NULL);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#264: FILE: include/asm-ia64/meminit.h:59:
+  extern int register_active_ranges (u64 start, u64 end, void *arg);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
