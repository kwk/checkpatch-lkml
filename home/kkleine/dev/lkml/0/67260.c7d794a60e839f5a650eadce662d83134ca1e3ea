WARNING:LONG_LINE_STRING: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#228: FILE: drivers/char/watchdog/at91_wdt.c:214:

A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

+		pr_info("at91_wdt: wdt_time value must be 1 <= wdt_time <= 256, using %d\n", wdt_time);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
