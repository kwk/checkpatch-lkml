WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#77: FILE: drivers/usb/gadget/at91_udc.c:1662:
+		if (request_irq(udc->board.vbus_pin, at91_vbus_irq, IRQF_DISABLED, driver_name, udc)) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
