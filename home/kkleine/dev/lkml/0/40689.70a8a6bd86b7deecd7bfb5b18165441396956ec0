WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'occurences' may be misspelled - perhaps 'occurrences'?
#27: 
Replace all occurences of page->index and page->mapping in the NFS client
            ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#79: FILE: fs/nfs/pagelist.c:89:
+	BUG_ON(page_file_mapping(page)->host != inode);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
