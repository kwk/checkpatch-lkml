CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#86: FILE: fs/block_dev.c:137:
+	if (bio_data_dir(bio) == READ)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'addr' - possible side-effects?
#119: FILE: fs/block_dev.c:165:
+#define PAGES_SPANNED(addr, len)	\
+	(DIV_ROUND_UP((addr) + (len), PAGE_SIZE) - (addr) / PAGE_SIZE);

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#119: FILE: fs/block_dev.c:165:
+#define PAGES_SPANNED(addr, len)	\
+	(DIV_ROUND_UP((addr) + (len), PAGE_SIZE) - (addr) / PAGE_SIZE);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#132: FILE: fs/block_dev.c:178:
+	int ret, nr_pages;
+	if (pvec->idx == pvec->nr) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#166: FILE: fs/block_dev.c:209:
+	struct bio * bio;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
