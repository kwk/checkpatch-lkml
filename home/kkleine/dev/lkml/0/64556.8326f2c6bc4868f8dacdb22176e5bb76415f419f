WARNING:MULTILINE_DEREFERENCE: Avoid multiple line dereference - prefer 'suspend_devinfo[suspend_writer_posn.current_chain].blocks_per_page'
#46: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_block_io.c:788:
+	for (i = 1; i < suspend_devinfo[suspend_writer_posn.current_chain].
+							blocks_per_page; i++)

A single dereferencing identifier spanned on multiple lines like::

  struct_identifier->member[index].
  member = <foo>;

is generally hard to follow. It can easily lead to typos and so makes
the code vulnerable to bugs.

If fixing the multiple line dereferencing leads to an 80 column
violation, then either rewrite the code in a more simple way or if the
starting part of the dereferencing identifier is the same and used at
multiple places then store it in a temporary variable, and use that
temporary variable only at all the places. For example, if there are
two dereferencing identifiers::

  member1->member2->member3.foo1;
  member1->member2->member3.foo2;

then store the member1->member2->member3 part in a temporary variable.
It not only helps to avoid the 80 column violation but also reduces
the program size by removing the unnecessary dereferences.

But if none of the above methods work then ignore the 80 column
violation because it is much easier to read a dereferencing identifier
on a single line.
