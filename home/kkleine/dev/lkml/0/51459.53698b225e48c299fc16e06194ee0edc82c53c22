#33: 
This patch splits the single main runqueue into several runqueues on each CPU.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
