WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#42: FILE: fs/splice.c:127:
+void generic_sock_buf_release(struct pipe_inode_info *pipe,
+					struct pipe_buffer *buf)

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pipe_buf_operations should normally be const
#54: FILE: fs/splice.c:142:
+static struct pipe_buf_operations sock_buf_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#75: FILE: include/linux/net.h:167:
+^Issize_t ^I(*splice_read)(struct socket *sock,  loff_t *ppos,$

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#76: FILE: include/linux/net.h:168:
+				       struct pipe_inode_info *pipe, size_t len, unsigned int flags);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pipe_inode_info *' should also have an identifier name
#88: FILE: include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h:75:
+void generic_sock_buf_release(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct pipe_buffer *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pipe_buffer *' should also have an identifier name
#88: FILE: include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h:75:
+void generic_sock_buf_release(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct pipe_buffer *);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#100: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:303:
+extern ssize_t			tcp_splice_read(struct socket *sk, loff_t *ppos,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns
#101: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:304:
+					        struct pipe_inode_info *pipe, size_t len, unsigned int flags);

#101: FILE: include/net/tcp.h:304:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
