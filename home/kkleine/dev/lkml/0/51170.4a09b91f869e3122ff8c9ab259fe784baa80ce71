ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#91: FILE: fs/ocfs2/namei.c:750:
+^I       ^Iif (inode->i_nlink == 2)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'inode->i_nlink == 2'
#128: FILE: fs/ocfs2/namei.c:839:
+	if (S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode) && (inode->i_nlink == 2))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
