CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#70: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/head64.c:44:
+	new_data = *(u32 *) (x86_boot_params + NEW_CL_POINTER);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#73: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/head64.c:46:
+		if (OLD_CL_MAGIC != *(u16 *)(real_mode_data + OLD_CL_MAGIC_ADDR)) {
 			return;
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
