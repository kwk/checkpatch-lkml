WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#98: FILE: include/linux/elfnote.h:41:
+#define ELFNOTE(name, type, desctype, descdata)	\
+.pushsection .note.name			;	\
+  .align 4				;	\
+  .long 2f - 1f		/* namesz */	;	\
+  .long 4f - 3f		/* descsz */	;	\

+4:.align 4				;	\
+.popsection				;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
