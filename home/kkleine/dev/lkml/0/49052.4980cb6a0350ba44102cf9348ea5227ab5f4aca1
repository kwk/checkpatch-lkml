ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#50: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-calgary.c:137:
+int debugging __read_mostly = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
