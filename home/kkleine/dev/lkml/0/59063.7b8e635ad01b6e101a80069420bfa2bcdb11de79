WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#138: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/setup.c:74:
+extern int ia64_acpi_madt_early_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
