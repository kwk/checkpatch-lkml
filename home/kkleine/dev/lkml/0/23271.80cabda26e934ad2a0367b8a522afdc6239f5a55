CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!par"
#144: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:786:
+	if (par == NULL || cpus_empty(cur->cpus_allowed))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#270: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1869:
+	if ((err = cpuset_add_file(cs_dentry, &cft_sched_domain)) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#299: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1991:
+		int retval = update_flag(CS_SCHED_DOMAIN, cs, "0");
+		if (retval < 0) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
