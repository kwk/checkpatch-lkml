WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'nsm_unmonitor', this function's name, in a string
#90: FILE: fs/lockd/mon.c:108:
+		dprintk("lockd: nsm_unmonitor(%s)\n", host->h_name);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_notice([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_notice(dev, ... then pr_notice(...  to printk(KERN_NOTICE ...
#96: FILE: fs/lockd/mon.c:112:
+			printk(KERN_NOTICE "lockd: cannot unmonitor %s\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#97: FILE: fs/lockd/mon.c:113:
