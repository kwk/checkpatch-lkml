WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#40: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#45: FILE: kernel/power/pagedir.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#46: FILE: kernel/power/pagedir.h:2:
+ * kernel/power/pagedir.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: kernel/power/pagedir.h:23:
+extern void suspend_copy_pageset1(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#69: FILE: kernel/power/pagedir.h:25:
+extern void suspend_free_extra_pagedir_memory(void);

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#71: FILE: kernel/power/pagedir.h:27:
+extern int suspend_allocate_extra_pagedir_memory(struct pagedir *p, int pageset_size, int alloc_from);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
