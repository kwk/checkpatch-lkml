ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#164: FILE: kernel/cpu_acct.c:145:
+	if (cpuacct_subsys.subsys_id < 0 || !root) return;

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#197: FILE: kernel/cpu_acct.c:178:
+	unsigned long long timestamp_now = get_jiffies_64();

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#263: FILE: include/linux/cpu_acct.h:10:
+extern void cpuacct_uncharge(struct task_struct *, cputime_t cputime);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct task_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#263: FILE: include/linux/cpu_acct.h:10:
+extern void cpuacct_uncharge(struct task_struct *, cputime_t cputime);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#267: FILE: include/linux/cpu_acct.h:14:
+static void inline cpuacct_uncharge(struct task_struct *p, cputime_t $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#267: FILE: include/linux/cpu_acct.h:14:
+static void inline cpuacct_uncharge(struct task_struct *p, cputime_t 

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#267: FILE: include/linux/cpu_acct.h:14:
+static void inline cpuacct_uncharge(struct task_struct *p, cputime_t 
cputime) {}

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
