WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#58: FILE: init/main.c:78:
+extern void bugcheck(char *, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'char *' should also have an identifier name
#58: FILE: init/main.c:78:
+extern void bugcheck(char *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

#58: FILE: init/main.c:78:
+extern void bugcheck(char *, int);

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after initcall_debug
#156: FILE: init/main.c:629:
+static int __initdata initcall_debug = 1;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#167: FILE: init/main.c:662:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#216: FILE: net/xfrm/xfrm_policy.c:45:
+	int i;
+	for (i = 0; i < NPROTO; i++)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
