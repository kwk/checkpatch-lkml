WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#48: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:1:
+/* Freezer declarations */

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:19:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#230: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:18:
+unsigned long freezer_state = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#233: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:21:
+#define freezer_message(msg, a...) do { printk(msg, ##a); } while(0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following struct go on the same line
#244: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:32:
+struct frozen_fs

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#263: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:51:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'sb->s_frozen == SB_FREEZE_TRANS'
#274: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:62:
+		if (!sb->s_root || !sb->s_bdev ||
+		    (sb->s_frozen == SB_FREEZE_TRANS) ||
+		    (sb->s_flags & MS_RDONLY))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*fs)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct frozen_fs)...)
#279: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:67:
+		fs = kmalloc(sizeof(struct frozen_fs), GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
