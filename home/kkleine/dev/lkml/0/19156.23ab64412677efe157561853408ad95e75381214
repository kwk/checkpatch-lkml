Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#157: FILE: drivers/video/cfbimgblt.c:86:
+		shift = val = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#165: FILE: drivers/video/cfbimgblt.c:92:
+			u32 start_mask = (~(u32)0 << start_index);
+			val = FB_READL(dst1);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#203: FILE: drivers/video/cfbimgblt.c:98:
+			if (!s) { src++; s = 32; }

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#324: FILE: drivers/video/cfbimgblt.c:166:
+		fgx = fgcolor = ((u32*)(p->pseudo_palette))[image->fg_color];

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns

+	if (bits % bpp == 0 && image->depth == 1 && !start_index && !pitch_index && bpp >= 8 && bpp <= 32

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
