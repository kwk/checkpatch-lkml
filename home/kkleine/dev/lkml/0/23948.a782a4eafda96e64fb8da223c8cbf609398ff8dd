Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#87: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2893:
+		next_balance = min(next_balance,
+				sd->last_balance + sd->balance_interval);

WARNING:JIFFIES_COMPARISON: Comparing jiffies is almost always wrong; prefer time_after, time_before and friends
#101: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3150:
+	if (jiffies >= rq->next_balance)
