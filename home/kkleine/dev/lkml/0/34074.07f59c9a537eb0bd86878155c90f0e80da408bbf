CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "jh->b_transaction"
#132: FILE: fs/jbd/transaction.c:1037:
+			if (jh->b_transaction != NULL &&

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#133: FILE: fs/jbd/transaction.c:1038:

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#136: FILE: fs/jbd/transaction.c:1041:
+				jh->b_jlist == BJ_SyncData) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#138: FILE: fs/jbd/transaction.c:1043:
+				wait_queue_head_t *queue_head;
+				spin_unlock(&journal->j_list_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#152: FILE: fs/jbd/transaction.c:1057:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
