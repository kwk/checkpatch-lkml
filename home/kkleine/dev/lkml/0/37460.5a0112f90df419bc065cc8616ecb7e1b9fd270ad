CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*_urb)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct _urb)...)
#59: FILE: drivers/bluetooth/hci_usb.c:150:
+	struct _urb *_urb = kzalloc(sizeof(struct _urb) +

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
