The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#65: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:356:
+extern void _tasklet_init(struct tasklet_struct *t,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#66: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:357:
+              void (*func)(unsigned long), unsigned long data);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+ * compiler can discard the string... */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
