Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#66: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:98:
+	if(n == 0)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'run_helper', this function's name, in a string
#70: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:102:
+			printk("run_helper : read on pipe failed, ret = %d\n", 

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
