CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#90: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:271:
+extern void tstats_update_stats(void *timer, pid_t pid, void *startf,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#91: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:272:
+				void *timerf, char * comm);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#292: FILE: kernel/time/timer_stats.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#293: FILE: kernel/time/timer_stats.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#368: FILE: kernel/time/timer_stats.c:77:
+		    entry->pid == pid) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#499: FILE: kernel/time/timer_stats.c:208:
+static struct file_operations tstats_fops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
