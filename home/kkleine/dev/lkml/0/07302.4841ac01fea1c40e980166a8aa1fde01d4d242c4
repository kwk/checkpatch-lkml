Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

+static int platform_pm_has_noirq_stage(struct device * dev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
