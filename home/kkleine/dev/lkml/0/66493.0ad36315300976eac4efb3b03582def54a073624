CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#79: FILE: include/linux/acct.h:127:
+extern void acct_collect(long exitcode, int group_dead);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
