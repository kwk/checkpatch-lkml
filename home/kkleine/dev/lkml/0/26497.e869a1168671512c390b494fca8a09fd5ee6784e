+    ---help---
+      Support hosting fully virtualized guest machines using hardware
+      virtualization extensions.  You will need a fairly recent Intel

+      a character device node named /dev/kvm.
+
+      To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module
+      will be called kvm.
+
+      If unsure, say N.
