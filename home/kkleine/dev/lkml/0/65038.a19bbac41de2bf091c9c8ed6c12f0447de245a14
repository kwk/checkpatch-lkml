WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct net_device *' should also have an identifier name
#423: FILE: net/core/dev.c:220:
+extern int netdev_rename_sysfs(struct net_device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#461: FILE: net/core/dev.c:1547:
+				struct net_namespace *orig_net_ns;
+				push_net_ns(dev->net_ns, orig_net_ns);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
