WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 138 exceeds 100 columns
#90: FILE: drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c:971:
+	{ USB_VENDOR_ID_PANTHERLORD, USB_DEVICE_ID_PANTHERLORD_TWIN_USB_JOYSTICK, HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT | HID_QUIRK_SKIP_OUTPUT_REPORTS },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
