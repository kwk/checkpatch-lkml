ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#223: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/keystore.c:299:
+^I^I/* encrypted session key - $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#224: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/keystore.c:300:
+		 *   (body_size-5-ECRYPTFS_SALT_SIZE) bytes */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
