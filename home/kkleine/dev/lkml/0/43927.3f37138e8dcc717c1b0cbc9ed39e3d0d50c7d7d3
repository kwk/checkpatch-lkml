WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form

Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#924: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#929: FILE: fs/no-block.c:1:
+/* no-block.c: implementation of routines required for non-BLOCK configuration

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#943: FILE: fs/no-block.c:15:
+static int no_blkdev_open(struct inode * inode, struct file * filp)
                                                               ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#943: FILE: fs/no-block.c:15:
+static int no_blkdev_open(struct inode * inode, struct file * filp)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#975: FILE: fs/proc/proc_misc.c:273:
+	else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'n' - possible side-effects?

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#1232: FILE: include/linux/buffer_head.h:318:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#1348: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1568:
+extern int invalidate_inodes(struct super_block *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
