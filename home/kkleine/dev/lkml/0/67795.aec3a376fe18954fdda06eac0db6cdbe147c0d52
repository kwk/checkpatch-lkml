Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#420: FILE: mm/rmap.c:478:
+	BUG_ON(PageAnon(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#440: FILE: mm/rmap.c:498:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#464: FILE: include/linux/rmap.h:112:
+int page_mkclean(struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
