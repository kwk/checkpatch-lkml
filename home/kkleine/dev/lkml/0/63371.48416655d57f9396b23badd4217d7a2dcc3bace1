WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 128 exceeds 100 columns

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#52: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:66:
+extern int FASTCALL(queue_delayed_work_on(int cpu, struct workqueue_struct *wq, struct work_struct *work, unsigned long delay));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
