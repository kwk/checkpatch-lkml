ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#100: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2353:
+	struct address_space * mapping = file->f_mapping;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#116: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2389:
+	written = written_direct = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:SPACING: space preferred before that '|' (ctx:VxE)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
