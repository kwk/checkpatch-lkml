CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vfc_dev_lst[instance]"
#45: FILE: drivers/sbus/char/vfc_dev.c:681:
+			if (vfc_dev_lst[instance] == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#47: FILE: drivers/sbus/char/vfc_dev.c:683:
+				int i;
+				for (i = 0; i < instance; i++) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#49: FILE: drivers/sbus/char/vfc_dev.c:685:
+						sbus_iounmap(vfc_dev_lst[i]->regs, sizeof(struct vfc_regs));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
