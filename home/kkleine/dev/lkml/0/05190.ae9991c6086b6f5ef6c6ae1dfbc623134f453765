Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#54: FILE: arch/ia64/mm/init.c:142:
+	end = (unsigned long) addr + size;

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#57: FILE: arch/ia64/mm/init.c:145:
+		struct page *page = virt_to_page(pg_addr);
+		set_bit(PG_arch_1, &page->flags);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
