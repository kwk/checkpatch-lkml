WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#186: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1072:
+		printk("adj: %d,%d,%d\n", zero_cnt, one_cnt, big_cnt);

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#187: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1073:
+		zero_cnt = one_cnt = big_cnt = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
