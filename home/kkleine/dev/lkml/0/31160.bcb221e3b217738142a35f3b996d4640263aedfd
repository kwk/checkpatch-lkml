ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#71: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:2440:
+static int pkt_setup_dev(dev_t dev, dev_t* pkt_dev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

#146: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:2515:
+	printk(DRIVER_NAME": setup of pktcdvd device failed\n");

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#146: FILE: drivers/block/pktcdvd.c:2515:
+	printk(DRIVER_NAME": setup of pktcdvd device failed\n");

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");
