CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#99: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:146:
+	available_memory = total_pages = total_pageable_pages();

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SUSPECT_CODE_INDENT: suspect code indent for conditional statements (16, 16)
#108: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:154:
+		if (available_memory > totalhigh_pages)
 		available_memory -= totalhigh_pages;
