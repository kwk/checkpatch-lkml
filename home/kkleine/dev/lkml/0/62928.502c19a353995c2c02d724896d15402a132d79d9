[PATCH] raid5: Configuration options to allow raid ops to run in raid5d context

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#68: FILE: drivers/md/Kconfig:165:
+config MD_RAID456_WORKQUEUE
+	depends on MD_RAID456
+	bool "Offload raid work to a workqueue from raid5d"
+	---help---
+	  This option enables raid work (block copy and xor operations)
+	  to run in a workqueue.  However this may come at the expense of
+	  extra context switching.  Single processor systems may benefit
+	  from keeping the work within the raid5d context.
+
+	  If unsure say, Y.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

+config MD_RAID456_WORKQUEUE_MULTITHREAD

+	bool "Enable multi-threaded raid processing"
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  This option controls whether the raid workqueue will be multi-
+	  threaded or single threaded.
+
+	  If unsure say, Y.
