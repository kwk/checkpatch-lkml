ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#42: FILE: drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_x25iface.c:211:
+	struct sk_buff * skb;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
