WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#105: FILE: fs/binfmt_elf.c:1193:
+	 * not masked.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#190: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:976:
+	coremask = (unsigned int)simple_strtoul(buffer, &end, 0);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#213: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:999:
+static struct file_operations proc_coremask_operations = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '|' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0644'.
#227: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1973:
+	REG("coremask",   S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR, coremask),

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.
