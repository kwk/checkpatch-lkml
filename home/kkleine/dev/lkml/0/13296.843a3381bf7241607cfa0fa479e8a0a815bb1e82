CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#52: FILE: include/linux/pid.h:67:
+extern void put_pid_rcu(struct pid *pid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#66: FILE: kernel/pid.c:202:
+	struct pid *pid = container_of(rhp, struct pid, rcu);
+	kmem_cache_free(pid_cachep, pid);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
