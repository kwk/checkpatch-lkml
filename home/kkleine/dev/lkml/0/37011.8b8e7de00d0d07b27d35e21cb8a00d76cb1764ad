Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#125: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1649:
+		BUG_ON(cpu_online(source_cpu));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#194: FILE: drivers/base/cpu.c:64:
+	dest_cpu = simple_strtoul(buf, NULL, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#206: FILE: drivers/base/cpu.c:76:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#252: FILE: include/linux/timer.h:101:
+extern int migrate_timers(int dest_cpu, int source_cpu, int cpu_down);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
