The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
