WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#62: FILE: arch/arm/mm/consistent.c:160:
+	 * platform--see CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
