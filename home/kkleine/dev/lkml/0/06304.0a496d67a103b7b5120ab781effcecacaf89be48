WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#63: FILE: drivers/media/video/cx2341x.c:923:
+	if (p->width != 720 || p->height != (p->is_50hz ? 576 : 480)) {
+		temporal = 0;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
