ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#133: FILE: kernel/module.c:2234:
+		buf [bx++] = 'P';

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#138: FILE: kernel/module.c:2239:
+	 * don't apply to modules */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
