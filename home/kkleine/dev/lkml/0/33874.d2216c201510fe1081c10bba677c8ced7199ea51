CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "mem"
#94: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/apic.c:666:
+	if (mem != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#117: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/apic.c:689:
+		printk("IO APIC resources could be not be allocated.\n");

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'occured' may be misspelled - perhaps 'occurred'?
#129: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/apic.c:701:
+/* Insert the IO APIC resources after PCI initialization has occured to handle
                                                              ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#130: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/apic.c:702:
+ * IO APICS that are mapped in on a BAR in PCI space. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
