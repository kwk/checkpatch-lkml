+struct svc_pool *  svc_pool_for_cpu(struct svc_serv *serv, int cpu);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::
