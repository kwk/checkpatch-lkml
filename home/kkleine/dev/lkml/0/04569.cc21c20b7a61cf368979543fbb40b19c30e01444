Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#212: FILE: drivers/mmc/mmc.c:892:
+	/*
+	* To support SD 2.0 cards, we must always invoke SD_SEND_IF_COND

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#248: FILE: drivers/mmc/mmc.c:1407:
+		if (err != MMC_ERR_NONE) {
+			return;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#263: FILE: drivers/mmc/mmc.c:1464:
+		int err, sd2;
+		err = mmc_send_if_cond(host, host->ocr, &sd2);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
