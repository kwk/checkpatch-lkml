ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#53: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_uverbs.c:324:
+	*mapped = (void*)do_mmap(NULL, 0, length, PROT_WRITE,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
