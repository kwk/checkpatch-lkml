Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#47: FILE: kernel/kthread.c:152:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "kthread_create: command name of "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'kthread_create', this function's name, in a string
#47: FILE: kernel/kthread.c:152:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "kthread_create: command name of "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#48: FILE: kernel/kthread.c:153:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "kthread_create: command name of "
+			  "pid %d truncated to \"%s\"\n", create.result->pid,

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
