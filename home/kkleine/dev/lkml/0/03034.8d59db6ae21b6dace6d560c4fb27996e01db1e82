ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#52: FILE: arch/arm/mach-imx/time.c:29:
+enum clock_event_mode clockevent_mode = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#89: FILE: arch/arm/mach-imx/time.c:66:
+	clockevent_imx.mult = div_sc(imx_get_perclk1(), NSEC_PER_SEC,
+					clockevent_imx.shift);
