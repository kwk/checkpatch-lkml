WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'distingush' may be misspelled - perhaps 'distinguish'?
#24: 
Use knowledge about EFLAGS layout (bits 22:63 are always 0) to distingush
                                                               ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#49: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c:193:
+	/* Assume the lock function has either no stack frame or a copy
+	   of eflags from PUSHF

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#50: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c:194:
+	   Eflags always has bits 22 and up cleared unlike kernel addresses. */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#59: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c:197:
+		unsigned long *sp = (unsigned long *)regs->rsp;
+		if (sp[0] >> 22)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
