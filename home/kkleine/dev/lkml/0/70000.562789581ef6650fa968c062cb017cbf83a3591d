#28: 
o Makefile.headerinst now fits within my 80 coloumn window
                                            ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#180: FILE: scripts/Makefile.headersinst:136:
+hdrinst := -rR -f $(srctree)/scripts/Makefile.headersinst obj

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
