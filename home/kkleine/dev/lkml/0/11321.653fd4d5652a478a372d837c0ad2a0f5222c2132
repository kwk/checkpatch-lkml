WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#65: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4proc.c:796:
+			BUG_ON(slack_bytes < COMPOUND_ERR_SLACK_SPACE);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
