CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#478: FILE: include/linux/pm.h:241:
+extern int dpm_runtime_suspend(struct dev_pm_info *, pm_message_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct dev_pm_info *' should also have an identifier name
#478: FILE: include/linux/pm.h:241:
+extern int dpm_runtime_suspend(struct dev_pm_info *, pm_message_t);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'pm_message_t' should also have an identifier name
#478: FILE: include/linux/pm.h:241:
+extern int dpm_runtime_suspend(struct dev_pm_info *, pm_message_t);

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'dpm' may be better as '(dpm)' to avoid precedence issues

#508: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:12:

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#511: FILE: drivers/base/power/power.h:15:
+#define pm_dbg(dpm, format, arg...) do { (void)(dpm); } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
