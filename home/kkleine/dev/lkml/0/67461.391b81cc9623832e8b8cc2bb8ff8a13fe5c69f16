Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "tsk->signal"
#156: FILE: kernel/posix-cpu-timers.c:1295:
+	if (likely(tsk->signal != NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sch"
#203: FILE: net/netfilter/xt_sctp.c:65:
