Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#75: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:2308:
+	uaddr = (unsigned long) ubuf;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#81: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:2314:
+	if (IS_ERR(bio)) {
+		return PTR_ERR(bio);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#100: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:2333:
+	if (!rq->bio)
[...]
+	else if (!q->back_merge_fn(q, rq, bio)) {
[...]
+	} else {
[...]

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#190: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:2413:
+	rq->buffer = rq->data = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#336: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:641:
+extern int blk_rq_map_user(request_queue_t *, struct request *, void __user *, unsigned long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'request_queue_t *' should also have an identifier name
#336: FILE: include/linux/blkdev.h:641:
+extern int blk_rq_map_user(request_queue_t *, struct request *, void __user *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
