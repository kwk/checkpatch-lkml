#35: 
Or, rather, this.  Have to remember to discard the old dentry if we don't need

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#97: 
Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dentry"
#118: FILE: fs/nfs/dir.c:1108:
+	if (dentry != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#123: FILE: fs/nfs/dir.c:1113:
+		 * and so needs reconsideration */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
