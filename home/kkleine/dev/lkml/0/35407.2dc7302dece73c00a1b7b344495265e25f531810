Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_PRECEDENCE: Macro argument 'var' may be better as '(var)' to avoid precedence issues

WARNING:SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO: Single statement macros should not use a do {} while (0) loop
#40: FILE: include/asm-m32r/system.h:331:
+#define set_mb(var, value) do { (void) xchg(&var, value); } while (0)

For the multi-statement macros, it is necessary to use the do-while
loop to avoid unpredictable code paths. The do-while loop helps to
group the multiple statements into a single one so that a
function-like macro can be used as a function only.

But for the single statement macros, it is unnecessary to use the
do-while loop. Although the code is syntactically correct but using
the do-while loop is redundant. So remove the do-while loop for single
statement macros.
