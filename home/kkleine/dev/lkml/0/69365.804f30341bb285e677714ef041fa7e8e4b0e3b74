#43: 
Makes sense. The patch on top of the latest -mm is below if you want to push

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#59: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/pci_32.c:1124:
+	BUG_ON(((mask+1) & mask) != 0);				\

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#59: FILE: arch/powerpc/kernel/pci_32.c:1124:
+	BUG_ON(((mask+1) & mask) != 0);				\

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
