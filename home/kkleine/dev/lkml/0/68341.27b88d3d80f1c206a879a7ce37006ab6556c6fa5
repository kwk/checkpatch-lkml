WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#62: FILE: drivers/char/scx200_gpio.c:32:
+extern void scx200_gpio_dump(unsigned index);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#96: FILE: drivers/char/scx200_gpio.c:130:
+	if (major)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
