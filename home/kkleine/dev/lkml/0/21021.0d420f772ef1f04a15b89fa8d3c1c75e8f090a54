WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinitdata is unnecessary
#41: FILE: drivers/clocksource/acpi_pm.c:80:
+static int __devinitdata acpi_pm_good;

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __devinitdata should be placed after acpi_pm_good
#41: FILE: drivers/clocksource/acpi_pm.c:80:
+static int __devinitdata acpi_pm_good;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.
