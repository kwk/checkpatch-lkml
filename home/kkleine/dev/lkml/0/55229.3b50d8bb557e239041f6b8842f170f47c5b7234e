ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0

+static int killsig = 0; /* signal that was used to kill last nfsd */

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *  bar" should be "foo *bar"
#157: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/svc.h:319:
+struct svc_serv *  svc_create(struct svc_program *, unsigned int,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct svc_program *' should also have an identifier name
#157: FILE: include/linux/sunrpc/svc.h:319:
+struct svc_serv *  svc_create(struct svc_program *, unsigned int,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
