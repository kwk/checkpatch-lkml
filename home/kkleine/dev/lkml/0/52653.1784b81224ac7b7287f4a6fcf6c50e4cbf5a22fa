ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#102: 
--- a/Documentation/arm/Samsung-S3C24XX/EB2410ITX.txt	2006-06-17 21:49:35.000000000 -0400

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
