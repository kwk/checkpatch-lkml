WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRWXUGO' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0777'.
#65: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1684:
+	NOD(PROC_TGID_INO, 	"self", S_IFLNK|S_IRWXUGO,

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct dentry_operations should normally be const
#87: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1706:
+static struct dentry_operations proc_base_dentry_operations =

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#88: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1707:
+static struct dentry_operations proc_base_dentry_operations =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#125: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:1744:
+	inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
