#41: 
This is a patch of ehca that assures 4k alignment for firmware control block

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#194: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_irq.c:166:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#215: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_iverbs.h:186:
+#define ehca_alloc_fw_ctrlblock() ((void*)get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL))

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.
