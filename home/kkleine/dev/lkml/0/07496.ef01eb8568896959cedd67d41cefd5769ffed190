CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#160: FILE: include/linux/page-flags.h:256:
+extern void cancel_dirty_page(struct page *page, unsigned int account_size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#197: FILE: mm/memory.c:1861:
+		unsigned char *kaddr = kmap_atomic(page, KM_USER0);
+		do {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
