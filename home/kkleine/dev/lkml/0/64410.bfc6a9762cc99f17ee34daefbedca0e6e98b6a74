CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#54: FILE: kernel/power/atomic_copy.c:151:
+	orig_pfn = copy_pfn = -1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#59: FILE: kernel/power/atomic_copy.c:156:
+		if (!this_pbe ||
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#60: FILE: kernel/power/atomic_copy.c:157:
+^I^I    ((((unsigned long) this_pbe) & (PAGE_SIZE - 1)) $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#64: FILE: kernel/power/atomic_copy.c:161:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
