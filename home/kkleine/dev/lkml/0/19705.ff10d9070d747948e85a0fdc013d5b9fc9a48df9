ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#75: 
--- a/drivers/video/cfbimgblt.c~revert-fbcon-rere-fix-little-endian-bogosity-in-slow_imageblit

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
