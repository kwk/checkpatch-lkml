ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#72: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_hpt3x3.c:181:
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
