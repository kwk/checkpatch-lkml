Move some functions out of the buffering code that aren't strictly buffering

Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#455: FILE: include/linux/buffer_head.h:303:

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#512: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2497:
+	BUG_ON(!PageLocked(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#515: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2500:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#521: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2506:

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#558: FILE: mm/truncate.c:35:
+	void (*invalidatepage)(struct page *, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#558: FILE: mm/truncate.c:35:
+	void (*invalidatepage)(struct page *, unsigned long);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#559: FILE: mm/truncate.c:36:
+	void (*invalidatepage)(struct page *, unsigned long);
+	invalidatepage = page->mapping->a_ops->invalidatepage;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
