WARNING:ALLOC_WITH_MULTIPLY: Prefer kmalloc_array over kmalloc with multiply
#209: FILE: fs/gfs2/dir.c:979:

Prefer kmalloc_array/kcalloc over kmalloc/kzalloc with a
sizeof multiply.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#377: FILE: fs/gfs2/eattr.h:22:

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#414: FILE: fs/gfs2/inode.c:510:
+		x = y = be64_to_cpu(z);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
