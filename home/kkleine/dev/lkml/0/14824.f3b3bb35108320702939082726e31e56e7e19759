I have built the kernel with the new patches and tried things out on x86_64 an 

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#109: FILE: pfmon/pfmon_task.c:1815:
+					dummy = write(workers[mycpu].from_worker[1], &msg, sizeof(msg));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
