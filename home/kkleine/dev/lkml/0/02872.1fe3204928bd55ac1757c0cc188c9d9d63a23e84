CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pci_dev_base"
#90: FILE: arch/x86_64/pci/mmconfig.c:118:
+	return pci_dev_base(seg, bus, devfn) != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#103: FILE: arch/i386/pci/pci.h:104:
+extern int __init pci_mmcfg_arch_reachable(unsigned int seg, unsigned int bus,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
