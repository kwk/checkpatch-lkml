BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#732: FILE: block/ll_rw_blk.c:2738:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#1136: FILE: include/linux/elevator.h:91:
+extern void elv_add_request(request_queue_t *, struct request *, int);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'request_queue_t *' should also have an identifier name
#1136: FILE: include/linux/elevator.h:91:
+extern void elv_add_request(request_queue_t *, struct request *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
