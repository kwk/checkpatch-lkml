One part of the system can attempt to use a mapped device before another has

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#105: FILE: drivers/md/dm.c:899:
+	BUG_ON(old_md != MINOR_ALLOCED);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
