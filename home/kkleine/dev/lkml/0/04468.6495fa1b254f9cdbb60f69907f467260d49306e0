CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#68: FILE: include/linux/nsproxy.h:47:
+extern void exit_task_namespaces(struct task_struct *p);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#82: FILE: kernel/nsproxy.c:42:
+	struct nsproxy *ns = p->nsproxy;
+	if (ns) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
