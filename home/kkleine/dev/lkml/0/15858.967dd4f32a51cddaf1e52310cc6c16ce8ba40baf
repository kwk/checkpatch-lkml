CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#58: FILE: drivers/md/dm-log.c:487:
+	struct log_c *lc = (struct log_c *) log->context;
+	lc->sync_search = 0;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
