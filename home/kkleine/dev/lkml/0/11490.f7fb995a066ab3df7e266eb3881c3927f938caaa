ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *			bar" should be "foo *bar"
#84: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape.h:188:
+	void *			requeue_task_data;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#137: FILE: drivers/s390/char/tape_34xx.c:134:
+	if ((p = kzalloc(sizeof(*p), GFP_ATOMIC)) == NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct work_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#394: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device.h:81:
+void ccw_device_do_unreg_rereg(struct work_struct *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct work_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#395: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device.h:82:
+void ccw_device_call_sch_unregister(struct work_struct *);
