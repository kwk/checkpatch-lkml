WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#77: FILE: security/selinux/ss/services.c:63:
+extern const struct selinux_class_perm selinux_class_perm;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
