#30: 
 handle-cpu_lock_acquire-and-cpu_lock_release-in-workqueue_cpu_callback.patch

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#183: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:475:
+	if (is_single_threaded(wq))
[...]
-	} else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
