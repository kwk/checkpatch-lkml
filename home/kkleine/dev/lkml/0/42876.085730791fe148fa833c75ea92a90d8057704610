CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#105: FILE: fs/ext2/ext2.h:140:
+extern long ext2_compat_ioctl(struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#105: FILE: fs/ext2/ext2.h:140:
+extern long ext2_compat_ioctl(struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned int' should also have an identifier name
#105: FILE: fs/ext2/ext2.h:140:
+extern long ext2_compat_ioctl(struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);

#105: FILE: fs/ext2/ext2.h:140:

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#175: FILE: fs/ext2/ioctl.c:110:
