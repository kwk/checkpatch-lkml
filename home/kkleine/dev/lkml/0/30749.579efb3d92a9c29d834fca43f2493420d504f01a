Having a defintition of __pa_symbol that works on both x86_64 and
         ^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
