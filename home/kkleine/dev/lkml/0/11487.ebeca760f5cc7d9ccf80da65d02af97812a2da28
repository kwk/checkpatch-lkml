#27: 
Should be applied together with the PNX UART header fixup patch last sent yesterday (http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/7/147). This stuff has been basically approved by rmk before he quitted maintaining serial core but hasn't been accepted yet due to merge window miss at that moment.

a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.
