ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#61: FILE: fs/nfs/idmap.c:121:

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct nfs_client *' should also have an identifier name
#107: FILE: include/linux/nfs_idmap.h:67:
+int nfs_idmap_new(struct nfs_client *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
