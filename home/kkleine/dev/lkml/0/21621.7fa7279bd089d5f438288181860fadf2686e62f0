#24: 
ATI SB600 SATA controller supports 4 modes: Legacy IDE, Native IDE, AHCI and RAID.IDE modes are used for compatibility with some old OS without AHCI driver,but now they are not necessary for Linux since the kernel has supported AHCI.Some BIOS set Legacy IDE as SB600 SATA's default mode, but the AHCI driver cannot run in Legacy IDE.So, we should set the controller back to AHCI mode if it has been set as IDE by BIOS.
