This patch makes changes required to fix compile errors in the sbc8560 target.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#63: FILE: arch/ppc/platforms/85xx/sbc85xx.h:54:
+ *    Can only choose from CLK9-12 */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
