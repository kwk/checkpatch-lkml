ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#84: FILE: drivers/ata/libata-core.c:6258:
+	if ((err = ata_pci_device_do_resume(pdev)))

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#133: FILE: include/linux/libata.h:722:
+extern int ata_pci_device_do_resume(struct pci_dev *pdev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
