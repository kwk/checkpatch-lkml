+^I ^I/* BOOL: in a polling reset situation. Must not trigger another reset yet */$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#61: FILE: drivers/ide/ide.c:1373:
+^I^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
