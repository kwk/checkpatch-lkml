#31: 
Export this sort of soft timer over workqueues and use it in ondemand governor.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#78: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:68:
+extern int queue_soft_delayed_work_on(int cpu, struct workqueue_struct *wq,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#79: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:69:
+extern int queue_soft_delayed_work_on(int cpu, struct workqueue_struct *wq,
+	struct work_struct *work, unsigned long delay);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#109: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:204:
+	struct timer_list *timer = &work->timer;
+	ret = queue_delayed_work_on(cpu, wq, work, delay);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#110: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:205:
+	if (ret) {
+		timer->flags |= TIMER_FLAG_NOT_IN_IDLE;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
