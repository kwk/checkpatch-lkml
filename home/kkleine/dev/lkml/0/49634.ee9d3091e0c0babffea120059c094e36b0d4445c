CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*nreg)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct region)...)
#82: FILE: drivers/md/dm-raid1.c:260:
+		nreg = kmalloc(sizeof(struct region), GFP_NOIO);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
