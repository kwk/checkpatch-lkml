ERROR:DATE_TIME: Use of the '__DATE__' macro makes the build non-deterministic
#65: FILE: drivers/edac/amd76x_edac.c:23:
+#define AMD76X_REVISION	" Ver: 2.0.1 "  __DATE__

It is generally desirable that building the same source code with
the same set of tools is reproducible, i.e. the output is always
exactly the same.

The kernel does *not* use the ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros,
and enables warnings if they are used as they can lead to
non-deterministic builds.
