+config DEFXX_MMIO
+	bool
+	prompt "Use MMIO instead of PIO" if PCI || EISA
+	depends on DEFXX
+	default n if PCI || EISA
+	default y
+	---help---
+	  This instructs the driver to use EISA or PCI memory-mapped I/O
+	  (MMIO) as appropriate instead of programmed I/O ports (PIO).
+	  Enabling this gives an improvement in processing time in parts
+	  of the driver, but it may cause problems with EISA (DEFEA)
+	  adapters.  TURBOchannel does not have the concept of I/O ports,
+	  so MMIO is always used for these (DEFTA) adapters.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
