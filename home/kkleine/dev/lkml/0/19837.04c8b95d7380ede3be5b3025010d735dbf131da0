The code tracks all resident pages (including shared pages) as RSS. This patch

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*mm->counter)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct mem_counter)...)
#117: FILE: kernel/res_group/memctlr.c:79:
+	mm->counter = kmalloc(sizeof(struct mem_counter), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#155: FILE: kernel/res_group/memctlr.c:117:
+	BUG_ON(res->magic != MEMCTLR_MAGIC);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files

+extern int mm_init_mem_counter(struct mm_struct *mm);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
