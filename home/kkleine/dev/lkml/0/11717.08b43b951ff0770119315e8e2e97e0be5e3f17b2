CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:163:
+extern int FASTCALL(run_scheduled_work(struct work_struct *work));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#108: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:128:
+	if (get_wq_data(work) == cwq
+	    && work_pending(work)

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#109: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:129:
+	    && work_pending(work)
+	    && !list_empty(&work->entry)) {

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#111: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:131:
+		work_func_t f = work->func;
+		list_del_init(&work->entry);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
