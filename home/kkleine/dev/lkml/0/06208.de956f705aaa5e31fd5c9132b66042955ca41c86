WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#53: 
#define TARGETSIZE (100 << 12)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#104: FILE: linus-test.c:64:
+                posix_fadvise(fd, 0, SIZE, 4);$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
