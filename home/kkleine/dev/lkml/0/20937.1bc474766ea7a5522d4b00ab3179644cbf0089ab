#36: 
This is a patch of ehca that assures 4k alignment for firmware control block

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#75: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_hca.c:53:
+	rblock = (struct hipz_query_hca*)ehca_alloc_fw_ctrlblock();

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#190: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_irq.c:166:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
