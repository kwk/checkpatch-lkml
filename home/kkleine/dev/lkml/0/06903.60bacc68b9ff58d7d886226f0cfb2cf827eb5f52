WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#170: FILE: include/asm-i386/pgtable.h:313:
+#define ptep_exchange(vma, address, ptep, old, new) \
+	(old).pte_low = xchg(&(ptep)->pte_low, (new).pte_low);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#186: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/pgtable.h:285:
unsigned long addr, pte_t *ptep)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#202: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/pgtable.h:296:
+#define ptep_exchange(vma, address, ptep, old, new) \
+	(old).pte = xchg(&(ptep)->pte, (new).pte);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#219: FILE: include/linux/page-flags.h:256:
+extern void cancel_dirty_page(struct page *page, unsigned int

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#257: FILE: mm/memory.c:1861:
+		unsigned char *kaddr = kmap_atomic(page, KM_USER0);
+		do {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:SPACING: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
#260: FILE: mm/memory.c:1864:
+		kunmap_atomic(kaddr,KM_USER0);
 		                   ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#264: FILE: mm/memory.c:1868:
+			printk("%s: BADNESS: truncate check %u\n", current->comm, check);

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#389: FILE: mm/truncate.c:57:
+	/* If we're cancelling the page, it had better not be mapped any more
+	if (page_mapped(page)) {

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#394: FILE: mm/truncate.c:62:
+^I^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
