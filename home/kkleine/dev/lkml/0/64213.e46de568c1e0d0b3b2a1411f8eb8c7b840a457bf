WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'ext3_put_super', this function's name, in a string
#58: FILE: ext3/super.c:425:
+       printk("!!! ext3_put_super !!!   has_fcache=%d\n", has_fcache);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
