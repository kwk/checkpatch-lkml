CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: include/net/sock.h:748:
+extern void FASTCALL(_lock_sock(struct sock *sk, int subclass));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#126: FILE: net/core/sock.c:1545:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(_lock_sock);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
