WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'segment_save', this function's name, in a string
#48: FILE: arch/s390/mm/extmem.c:566:
+		PRINT_ERR("could not find segment %s in segment_save, please "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#49: FILE: arch/s390/mm/extmem.c:567:
+		PRINT_ERR("could not find segment %s in segment_save, please "
+			  "report to linux390@de.ibm.com\n", name);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
