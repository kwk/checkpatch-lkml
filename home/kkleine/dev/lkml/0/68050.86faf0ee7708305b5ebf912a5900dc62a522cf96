WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#102: 
### Diffstat output

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix '.' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!list"
#114: FILE: fs/dcache.c:407:
+	if (list == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
