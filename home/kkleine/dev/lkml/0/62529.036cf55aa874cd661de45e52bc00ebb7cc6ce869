Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

  } while(something);
