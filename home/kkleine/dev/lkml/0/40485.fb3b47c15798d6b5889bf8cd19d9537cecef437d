ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

fm,

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

+int ecryptfs_inode_test(struct inode *inode, void *candidate_lower_inode)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#105: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/inode.c:1028:
+	BUG_ON(!ecryptfs_inode_to_private(inode));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#106: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/inode.c:1029:
+	if ((ecryptfs_inode_to_lower(inode)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:ASSIGNMENT_CONTINUATIONS: Assignment operator '=' should be on the previous line
#107: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/inode.c:1030:
+	if ((ecryptfs_inode_to_lower(inode)
+	     =3D=3D (struct inode *)candidate_lower_inode))

Assignment operators should not be written at the start of a
line but should follow the operand at the previous line.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#107: FILE: fs/ecryptfs/inode.c:1030:
+	     =3D=3D (struct inode *)candidate_lower_inode))

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
