WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#88: FILE: tree.h:4146:
+/* Non-zero if we are folding constants inside an initializer; zero
+   otherwise.  */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#114: FILE: fold-const.c:64:
+int folding_initializer = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
