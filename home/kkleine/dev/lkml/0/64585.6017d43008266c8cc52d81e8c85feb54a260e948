Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL: switch and case should be at the same indent

switch should be at the same indent as case.
Example::

  switch (suffix) {
  case 'G':
  case 'g':
          mem <<= 30;
          break;
  case 'M':
  case 'm':
          mem <<= 20;
          break;
  case 'K':
  case 'k':
          mem <<= 10;
          fallthrough;
  default:
          break;
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#54: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:122:
+		case S_IFREG: /* Regular file: current size - holes + free
+				 space on part */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
