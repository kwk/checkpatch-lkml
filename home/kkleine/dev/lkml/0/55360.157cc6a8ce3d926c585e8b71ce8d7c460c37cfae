ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#100: FILE: drivers/video/geode/video_gx.c:178:
+static void
+gx_configure_tft(struct fb_info *info) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#102: FILE: drivers/video/geode/video_gx.c:180:
+gx_configure_tft(struct fb_info *info) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#223: FILE: drivers/video/geode/video_gx.h:50:
+#define GX_FP_PT2_VSP (1 << 23)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))
