#26: 
This patch cleans up the slab allocation path by making the UMA case look like

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#115: FILE: mm/slab.c:3183:
+	if (nodeid == SLAB_CURRENT_NODE || nodeid == numa_node_id() ||
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#116: FILE: mm/slab.c:3184:

+			!cachep->nodelists[nodeid]) {

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#126: FILE: mm/slab.c:3194:
+^I ^Iif (!objp)$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#128: FILE: mm/slab.c:3196:
+	} else

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#164: FILE: mm/slab.c:3232:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
