description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinit is unnecessary
#48: FILE: drivers/char/agp/efficeon-agp.c:340:
 static int __devinit agp_efficeon_probe(struct pci_dev *pdev,

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...

+	printk(KERN_DEBUG PFX "agp_efficeon_resume()\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'agp_efficeon_resume', this function's name, in a string
#63: FILE: drivers/char/agp/efficeon-agp.c:418:
+	printk(KERN_DEBUG PFX "agp_efficeon_resume()\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
