CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#55: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/transmeta.c:20:
+	cpu_rev = cpu_freq = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
