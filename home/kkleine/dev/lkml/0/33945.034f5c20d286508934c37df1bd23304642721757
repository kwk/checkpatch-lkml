CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#48: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_qp.c:520:
+		qp->s_psn = qp->s_next_psn = attr->sq_psn;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
