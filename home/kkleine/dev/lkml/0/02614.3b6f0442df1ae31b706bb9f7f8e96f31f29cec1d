CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#52: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:246:
+extern void swap_free(swp_entry_t, struct page *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'swp_entry_t' should also have an identifier name
#52: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:246:
+extern void swap_free(swp_entry_t, struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#52: FILE: include/linux/swap.h:246:
+extern void swap_free(swp_entry_t, struct page *);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#157: FILE: mm/swapfile.c:303:
+		unsigned long offset = swp_offset(entry);
+		if (swap_entry_free(p, offset) == 0

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
