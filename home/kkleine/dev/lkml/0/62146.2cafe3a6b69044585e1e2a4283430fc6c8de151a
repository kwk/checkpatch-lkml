Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#41: FILE: drivers/net/wireless/Kconfig:506:
+config USB_ZD1201
+	tristate "USB ZD1201 based Wireless device support"
+	depends on NET_RADIO
+	select FW_LOADER
+	---help---
+	  Say Y if you want to use wireless LAN adapters based on the ZyDAS
+	  ZD1201 chip.
+
+	  This driver makes the adapter appear as a normal Ethernet interface,
+	  typically on wlan0.
+	  
+	  The zd1201 device requires external firmware to be loaded.
+	  This can be found at http://linux-lc100020.sourceforge.net/
+	  
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
+	  module will be called zd1201.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
