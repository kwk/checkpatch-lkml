WARNING:IN_ATOMIC: use of in_atomic() is incorrect outside core kernel code
#86: FILE: arch/m68k/atari/time.c:217:
+	if (in_atomic() || irqs_disabled())

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#100: FILE: arch/m68k/kernel/ints.c:135:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
