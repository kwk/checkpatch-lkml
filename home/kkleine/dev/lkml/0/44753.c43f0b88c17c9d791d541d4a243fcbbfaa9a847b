ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#56: FILE: mm/mprotect.c:206:
+/* $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#56: FILE: mm/mprotect.c:206:
 }
+/* 

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#96: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:140:
+extern int do_mprotect(unsigned long start, size_t len, unsigned long prot);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
