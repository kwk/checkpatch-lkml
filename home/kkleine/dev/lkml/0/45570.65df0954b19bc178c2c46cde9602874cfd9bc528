CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*save_state)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct pci_cap_saved_state)...)
#88: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:456:
+	save_state = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pci_cap_saved_state) + sizeof(u16) * 4,

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

+	save_state = kzalloc(sizeof(struct pci_cap_saved_state) + sizeof(u16) * 4,
