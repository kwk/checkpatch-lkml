CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#203: FILE: drivers/md/dm-crypt.c:892:
+	io->error = io->post_process = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxW)
#220: FILE: drivers/md/dm-crypt.c:1005:
+	.version= {1, 3, 0},
