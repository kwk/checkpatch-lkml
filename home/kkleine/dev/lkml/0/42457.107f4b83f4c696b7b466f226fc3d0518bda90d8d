ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#51: 
--- a/arch/arm/kernel/entry-common.S

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#102: FILE: arch/arm/kernel/calls.S:2:
+ *	linux/arch/arm/kernel/calls.S

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
