page_file_index - gives the offset of this page in the file in PAGE_CACHE_SIZE

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#67: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:584:
+struct swap_info_struct * page_swap_info(struct page *page)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#70: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:587:
+	BUG_ON(!PageSwapCache(page));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
