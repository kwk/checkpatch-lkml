The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#96: FILE: drivers/leds/Kconfig:95:
+config LEDS_TRIGGER_CPU

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
