CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#62: FILE: fs/open.c:711:
+		if (dentry->d_sb->s_type->fs_flags & FS_RAM_BASED)
[...]
+		else if (!f->f_mapping->a_ops ||
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#86: FILE: fs/ramfs/inode.c:208:
+^I.fs_flags^I= FS_RAM_BASED,^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
