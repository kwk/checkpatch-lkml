WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#170: FILE: fs/fuse/dev.c:135:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#171: FILE: fs/fuse/dev.c:136:
+	void (*end) (struct fuse_conn *, struct fuse_req *) = req->end;
+	req->end = NULL;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#265: FILE: fs/fuse/dev.c:164:
+	if (req->force)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
