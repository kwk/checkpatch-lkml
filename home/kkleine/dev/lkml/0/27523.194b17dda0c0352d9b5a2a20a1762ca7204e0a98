ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#55: FILE: fs/lockd/svcsubs.c:327:
+	if (host->h_server)
+	{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#64: FILE: fs/lockd/svcsubs.c:336:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
