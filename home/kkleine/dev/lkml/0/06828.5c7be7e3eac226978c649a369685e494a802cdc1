Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#224: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/ads7846.c:537:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#234: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/ads7846.c:731:
+	if (pdata->filter != NULL) {
[...]
+	} else if (pdata->debounce_max) {
[...]
+		ts->filter = ads7846_debounce;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pdata->filter"
#234: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/ads7846.c:731:
+	if (pdata->filter != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "pdata->filter_init"
#235: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/ads7846.c:732:
+		if (pdata->filter_init != NULL) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "ts->filter_cleanup"
#317: FILE: drivers/input/touchscreen/ads7846.c:931:
