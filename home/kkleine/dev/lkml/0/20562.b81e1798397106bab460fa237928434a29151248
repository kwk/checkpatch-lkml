ERROR:FSF_MAILING_ADDRESS: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already includes a copy of the GPL.
#82: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/srm_env.c:27:
  * Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place,$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#149: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/srm_env.c:95:
+	if ((ret >> 61) =3D=3D 0) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#149: FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/srm_env.c:95:
+	if ((ret >> 61) =3D=3D 0) {
[...]
+		*eof =3D 1;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
