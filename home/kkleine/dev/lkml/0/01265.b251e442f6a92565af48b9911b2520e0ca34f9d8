CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/linux/sysctl.h:927:
+extern struct ctl_table_header *sysctl_head_next(struct ctl_table_header *prev);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+	spin_lock(&sysctl_lock);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
