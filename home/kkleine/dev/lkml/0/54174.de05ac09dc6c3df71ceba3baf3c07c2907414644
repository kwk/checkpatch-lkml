ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#298: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs4xdr.c:3054:
+	if ((status = decode_attr_owner(xdr, bitmap, server->nfs_client, &fattr->uid)) != 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!server->nfs_client->cl_idmap"
#332: FILE: fs/nfs/super.c:1149:
+	if (server->nfs_client->cl_idmap == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#354: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs_sb.h:46:
+	struct nfs_client *	nfs_client;	/* all NFSv4 state starts here */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
