CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#99: FILE: include/linux/tty.h:300:
+extern void tty_get_termios(struct tty_driver *drv, int idx, struct termios *tio);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
