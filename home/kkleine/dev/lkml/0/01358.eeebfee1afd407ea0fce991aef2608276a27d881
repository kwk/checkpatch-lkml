WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#55: FILE: include/linux/akt.h:208:
+#define DECLARE_TUNABLE(s)	struct auto_tune s;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#277: FILE: kernel/autotune/akt.c:359:

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
