WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#36: FILE: drivers/media/video/zoran_card.c:1281:
+	       (dev = pci_get_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_ZORAN, PCI_DEVICE_ID_ZORAN_36057, dev)) != NULL) {

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

distractions when editing files.
