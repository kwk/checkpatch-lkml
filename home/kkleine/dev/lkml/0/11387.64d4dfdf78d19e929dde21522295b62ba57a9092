WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#61: FILE: arch/x86_64/pci/mmconfig.c:142:
+		u32 size = (pci_mmcfg_config[0].end_bus_number - pci_mmcfg_config[0].start_bus_number + 1) << 20;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
