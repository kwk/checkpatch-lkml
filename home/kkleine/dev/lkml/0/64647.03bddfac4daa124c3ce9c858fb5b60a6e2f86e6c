ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <NoImage>
#69: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:694:
+			strcpy(header->sig, NoImage);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#71: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:696:
+			result = changed = 1;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
