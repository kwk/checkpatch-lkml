WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rexmit', this function's name, in a string
#185: FILE: drivers/block/aoe/aoecmd.c:290:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "aoe: rexmit: too many lost jumbo.  "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#186: FILE: drivers/block/aoe/aoecmd.c:291:
+			printk(KERN_INFO "aoe: rexmit: too many lost jumbo.  "
+				"dropping back to 1KB frames.\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
