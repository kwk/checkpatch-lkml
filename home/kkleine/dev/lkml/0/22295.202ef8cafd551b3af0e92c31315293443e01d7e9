Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#162: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:123:
+#define MS_FROZEN	(1<<21)	/* Frozen by freeze_filesystems() */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'sb->s_frozen == SB_FREEZE_TRANS'
#188: FILE: fs/buffer.c:261:
+		if (!sb->s_root || !sb->s_bdev ||
+		    (sb->s_frozen == SB_FREEZE_TRANS) ||

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#240: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:60:
+extern void thaw_processes(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
