The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'mspec_close', this function's name, in a string
#252: FILE: drivers/char/mspec.c:169:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "mspec_close(): "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#253: FILE: drivers/char/mspec.c:170:

+			       "failed to zero page %i\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
