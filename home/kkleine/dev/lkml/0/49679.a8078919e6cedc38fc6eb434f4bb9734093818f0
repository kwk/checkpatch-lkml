Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#657: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1183:
+extern void do_timer(unsigned long ticks);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
