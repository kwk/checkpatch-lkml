WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#187: FILE: include/linux/module.h:412:
+extern void module_put(struct module *module);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#253: FILE: kernel/module.c:797:
+		unsigned int cpu = get_cpu();
+		local_dec(&module->ref[cpu].count);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
