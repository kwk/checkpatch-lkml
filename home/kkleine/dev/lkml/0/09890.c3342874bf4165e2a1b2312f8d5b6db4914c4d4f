ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#80: FILE: fs/libfs.c:359:
+int __simple_fill_super(struct super_block *s, int magic,
+			struct tree_descr *files, bool registered)
  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#112: FILE: fs/libfs.c:410:
+^I^I^Iinode->i_ino = i;^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#138: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1882:
+extern int __simple_fill_super(struct super_block *s, int magic,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
