Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONSTANT_COMPARISON: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test

Comparisons with a constant or upper case identifier on the left
side of the test should be avoided.

WARNING:JIFFIES_COMPARISON: Comparing jiffies is almost always wrong; prefer time_after, time_before and friends
