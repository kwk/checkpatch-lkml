                       ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_VARIABLE: Use of EXTRA_CFLAGS is deprecated, please use `ccflags-y instead.
#56: FILE: fs/reiserfs/Makefile:33:
+EXTRA_CFLAGS += $(shell set -x ; if [ $(call cc-version) -lt 0500 ] ; then echo -O1 ; fi ;)

EXTRA_{A,C,CPP,LD}FLAGS are deprecated and should be replaced by the new
flags added via commit f77bf01425b1 ("kbuild: introduce ccflags-y,
asflags-y and ldflags-y").

The following conversion scheme maybe used::

  EXTRA_AFLAGS    ->  asflags-y
  EXTRA_CFLAGS    ->  ccflags-y
  EXTRA_CPPFLAGS  ->  cppflags-y
  EXTRA_LDFLAGS   ->  ldflags-y
