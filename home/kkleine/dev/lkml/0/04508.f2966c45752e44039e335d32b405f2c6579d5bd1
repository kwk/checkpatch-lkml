The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#48: FILE: drivers/kvm/mmu.c:41:
+#define pgprintk(x...) do { if (dbg) printk(x); } while (0)

#49: FILE: drivers/kvm/mmu.c:42:
+#define rmap_printk(x...) do { if (dbg) printk(x); } while (0)

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#95: FILE: drivers/kvm/mmu.c:1324:
+		if (level > 1)
[...]
+		else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
