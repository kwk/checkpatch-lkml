WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#64: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_promise.c:435:
+		BUG_ON(qc->dev->cdb_len & ~0x1E);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#97: FILE: drivers/ata/sata_promise.c:804:
+		unsigned int lba;
+		lba = (scsicmd[2] << 24) | (scsicmd[3] << 16) | (scsicmd[4] << 8) | scsicmd[5];

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
