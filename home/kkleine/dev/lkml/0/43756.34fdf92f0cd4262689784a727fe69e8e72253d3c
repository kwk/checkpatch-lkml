WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#117: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:439:
+	 * VM_MANYPROTS; present PTE's are correct for VM_MANYPROTS. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#205: FILE: arch/x86_64/mm/fault.c:503:
+		BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#281: FILE: mm/memory.c:2218:
+static inline int check_perms(struct vm_area_struct * vma, int access_mask) {

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#281: FILE: mm/memory.c:2218:
+static inline int check_perms(struct vm_area_struct * vma, int access_mask) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
