ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#46: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_block_io.c:523:
+	static int running_already = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#53: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_block_io.c:530:
+	while(!list_empty(&ioinfo_submit_batch)) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#55: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_block_io.c:532:
+		first = list_entry(ioinfo_submit_batch.next, struct io_info,
+									list);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#57: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_block_io.c:534:
+		BUG_ON(!test_and_clear_bit(IO_AWAITING_SUBMIT, &first->flags));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
