WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#167: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/ieee1394_transactions.c:125:
+	 * Use the same transaction label for all broadcast transactions. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#179: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/ieee1394_transactions.c:130:
+	BUG_ON(n > ARRAY_SIZE(packet->host->tpool));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:IN_ATOMIC: do not use in_atomic in drivers
#223: FILE: drivers/ieee1394/ieee1394_transactions.c:173:
+	if (irqs_disabled() || in_atomic())

in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,
but it is not reliable in this use model.  Therefore its use is
strongly discouraged.

However, in_atomic() is ok for core kernel use.
