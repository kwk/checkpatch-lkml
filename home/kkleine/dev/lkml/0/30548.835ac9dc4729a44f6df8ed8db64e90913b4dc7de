WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#43: FILE: fs/unionfs/stale_inode.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct address_space_operations should normally be const
#58: FILE: fs/unionfs/stale_inode.c:16:
+static struct address_space_operations unionfs_stale_aops;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#61: FILE: fs/unionfs/stale_inode.c:19:
+extern struct inode_operations stale_inode_ops;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#61: FILE: fs/unionfs/stale_inode.c:19:

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'nd' may be misspelled - perhaps 'and'?

                                                                       ^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#78: FILE: fs/unionfs/stale_inode.c:36:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#133: FILE: fs/unionfs/stale_inode.c:91:
+	inode->i_atime = inode->i_mtime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
