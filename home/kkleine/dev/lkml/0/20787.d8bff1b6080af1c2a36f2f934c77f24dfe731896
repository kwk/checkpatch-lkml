The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#159: FILE: drivers/spi/atmel_spi.c:73:
+{
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#296: FILE: drivers/spi/atmel_spi.c:210:
+	BUG_ON(as->current_transfer);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#312: FILE: drivers/spi/atmel_spi.c:226:
+	xfer->tx_dma = xfer->rx_dma = INVALID_DMA_ADDRESS;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#315: FILE: drivers/spi/atmel_spi.c:229:

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#360: FILE: drivers/spi/atmel_spi.c:274:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
