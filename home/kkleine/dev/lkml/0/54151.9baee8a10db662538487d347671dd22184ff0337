When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#196: FILE: fs/nfs/internal.h:23:
+extern int nfs_create_rpc_client(struct nfs_client *, int, unsigned int,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct nfs_client *' should also have an identifier name
#196: FILE: fs/nfs/internal.h:23:
+extern int nfs_create_rpc_client(struct nfs_client *, int, unsigned int,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
