WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#63: FILE: fs/splice.c:161:
+ssize_t splice_to_pipe(struct pipe_inode_info *pipe,
 			      struct splice_pipe_desc *spd)

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pipe_buf_operations should normally be const
#87: FILE: include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h:116:
+	struct pipe_buf_operations *ops;/* ops associated with output pipe */

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct pipe_inode_info *' should also have an identifier name
#90: FILE: include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h:119:
+ssize_t splice_to_pipe(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct splice_pipe_desc *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct splice_pipe_desc *' should also have an identifier name
#90: FILE: include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h:119:
+ssize_t splice_to_pipe(struct pipe_inode_info *, struct splice_pipe_desc *);

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
