ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#83: FILE: fs/libfs.c:359:

  {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#95: FILE: fs/libfs.c:387:
+         * will assign to an inode$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#125: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1882:
+extern int __simple_fill_super(struct super_block *s, int magic,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
