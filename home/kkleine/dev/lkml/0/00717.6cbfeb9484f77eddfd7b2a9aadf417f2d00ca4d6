Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
