WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#90: FILE: drivers/media/video/cx88/cx88-core.c:661:
+	/* SECAM have also different sub carrier for chroma,
+	   but step_db and step_dr, at cx88_set_tvnorm already handles that.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
