CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#51: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1751:
+extern int generic_file_buffered_write_one_kernel_page(struct address_space *,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct address_space *' should also have an identifier name
#51: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1751:
+extern int generic_file_buffered_write_one_kernel_page(struct address_space *,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'pgoff_t' should also have an identifier name
#51: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1751:
+extern int generic_file_buffered_write_one_kernel_page(struct address_space *,

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#51: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1751:
+extern int generic_file_buffered_write_one_kernel_page(struct address_space *,

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#91: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2266:
+		BUG_ON(cached_page);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#139: FILE: mm/filemap.c:2314:
+	 * MS_SYNCHRONOUS here */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
