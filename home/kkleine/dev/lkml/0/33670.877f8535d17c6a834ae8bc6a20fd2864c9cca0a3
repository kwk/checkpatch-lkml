WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'seperated' may be misspelled - perhaps 'separated'?
#48: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c:1228:
+ * seperated @sep.
    ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:SPACING: spaces required around that '=' (ctx:VxV)
#55: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c:1235:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'nfsd4_encode_components', this function's name, in a string
#58: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c:1238:
+	dprintk("nfsd4_encode_components(%s)\n", components);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#59: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c:1239:
+	if ((*buflen -= 4) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#62: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c:1242:
+	end = str = components;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#67: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c:1247:
+		if (strlen) {
[...]
+		else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#68: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c:1248:

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#74: FILE: fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c:1254:
+		}

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
