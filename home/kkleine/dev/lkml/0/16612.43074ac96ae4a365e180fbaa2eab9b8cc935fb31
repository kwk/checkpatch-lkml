Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph

So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
