CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#285: FILE: include/linux/acct.h:126:
+extern void acct_init_pacct(struct pacct_struct *pacct, struct task_struct *tsk);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#444: FILE: kernel/acct.c:524:
+	pacct->ac_utime = pacct->ac_stime = cputime_zero;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#454: FILE: kernel/acct.c:534:
+		struct vm_area_struct *vma;
+		down_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:FUNCTION_WITHOUT_ARGS: Bad function definition - void acct_process() should probably be void acct_process(void)
#491: FILE: kernel/acct.c:570:
+void acct_process()

Function declarations without arguments like::

  int foo()

should be::

  int foo(void)
