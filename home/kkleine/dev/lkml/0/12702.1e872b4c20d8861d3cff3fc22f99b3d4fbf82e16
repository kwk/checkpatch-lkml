CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#62: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/chsc.c:751:
+		if (check_for_io_on_path(sch, chp))
[...]
+		else if (!sch->lpm) {
[...]
-				sch->driver->verify(&sch->dev);
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
