WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 105 exceeds 100 columns
#83: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S:92:
+#define VSYSCALL_PHYS_ADDR ((LOADADDR(.data.page_aligned) + SIZEOF(.data.page_aligned) + 4095) & ~(4095))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
