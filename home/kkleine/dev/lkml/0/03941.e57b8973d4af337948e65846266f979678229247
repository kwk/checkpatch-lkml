#47: FILE: fs/cifs/misc.c:74:
+	ret_buf = kzalloc(sizeof (struct cifsSesInfo), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
