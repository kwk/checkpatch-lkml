Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct napi_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#346: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:265:
+	int			(*poll)(struct napi_struct *, int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following enum go on the same line
#350: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:269:
+enum

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#372: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:291:
+extern void FASTCALL(__napi_schedule(struct napi_struct *n));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#387: FILE: include/linux/netdevice.h:306:
+	BUG_ON(!test_bit(NAPI_STATE_SCHED, &n->state));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
