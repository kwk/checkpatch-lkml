WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#74: FILE: vioc.c:1:
+/* Copyright 2006 Fabric7 Systems, Inc */

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#85: FILE: vioc.c:12:
+#define VIOC_REGS_LINE_SIZE^Isizeof(struct regs_line)^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#91: FILE: vioc.c:18:
+	struct regs_line *reg_info = (struct regs_line *) regs->data;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#103: FILE: vioc.c:30:

+		printf("%08x = %08x\n", reg_info[i].addr, reg_info[i].data);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
