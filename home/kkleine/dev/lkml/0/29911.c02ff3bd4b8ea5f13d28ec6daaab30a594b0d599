WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 125 exceeds 100 columns
#41: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/mos7840.c:1090:
+	dbg("\n\nusb_serial serial:%p       mos7840_port:%p\n      usb_serial_port port:%p\n\n", serial, mos7840_port, port);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
