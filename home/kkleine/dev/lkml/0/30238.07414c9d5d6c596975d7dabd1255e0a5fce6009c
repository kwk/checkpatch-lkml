ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#75: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1708:
+static const char * const policy_types[] = $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#76: FILE: mm/mempolicy.c:1709:
+static const char * const policy_types[] = 
+	{ "default", "prefer", "bind", "interleave" };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
