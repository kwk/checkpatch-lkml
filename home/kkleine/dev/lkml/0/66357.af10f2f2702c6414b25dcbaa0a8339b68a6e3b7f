WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#132: FILE: fs/dcache.c:414:
+			int skip = count;
+			while (skip && tmp != &dentry_unused &&

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#133: FILE: fs/dcache.c:415:
+			while (skip && tmp != &dentry_unused &&
+			    list_entry(tmp, struct dentry, d_lru)->d_sb != sb) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "dentry->d_sb->s_root"
#172: FILE: fs/dcache.c:471:
+			if (dentry->d_sb->s_root != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
