WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#60: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#1443: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/mpc834x_itx.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#1444: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/mpc834x_itx.c:2:
+ * arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/mpc834x_itx.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#1471: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/mpc834x_itx.c:29:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/io.h> instead of <asm/io.h>
#1473: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/mpc834x_itx.c:31:
+#include <asm/io.h>

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#1487: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/mpc834x_itx.c:45:
+unsigned long isa_io_base = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#1488: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/mpc834x_itx.c:46:
+unsigned long isa_mem_base = 0;

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'mpc834x_itx_setup_arch', this function's name, in a string
#1521: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/mpc834x_itx.c:79:
+		ppc_md.progress("mpc834x_itx_setup_arch()", 0);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

ERROR:SPACING: exactly one space required after that #ifdef
#1542: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/mpc834x_itx.c:100:
+#ifdef  CONFIG_ROOT_NFS

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Root_NFS>
#1543: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/mpc834x_itx.c:101:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Root_HDA1>

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines

+	/* We always match for now, eventually we should look at the flat
+	   dev tree to ensure this is the board we are suppose to run on

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
