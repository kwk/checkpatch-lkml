#26: 
chipset variants. Split the chipset programming and init time method selection into two functions. 

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#63: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_ali.c:509:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#92: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_ali.c:538:
+		/* Configure the ALi bridge logic. For non ALi rely on BIOS.
+		   Set the south bridge enable bit */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

#169: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_ali.c:666:
+^I        ^Iport_info[0] = port_info[1] = &info_20_udma;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#169: FILE: drivers/ata/pata_ali.c:666:
+	        	port_info[0] = port_info[1] = &info_20_udma;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
