CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#352: FILE: net/ipv4/etherip.c:282:
+		p.i_flags = p.o_flags = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#354: FILE: net/ipv4/etherip.c:284:
+		if ((err = etherip_param_check(&p)) < 0)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "t"
#360: FILE: net/ipv4/etherip.c:290:
+		if (t != NULL && t->dev != dev)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#364: FILE: net/ipv4/etherip.c:294:
+		if (cmd == SIOCADDTUNNEL) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

  2. Comparisons in if::
