#28: 
This is an update/cleanup based off a patch submitted by Daniel Ferenci a few years ago.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: include/net/x25.h:210:
+extern void x25_clear_forwards(struct net_device *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct net_device *' should also have an identifier name
#57: FILE: include/net/x25.h:210:
+extern void x25_clear_forwards(struct net_device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
