WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct nfs_server *' should also have an identifier name
#58: FILE: include/linux/nfs_xdr.h:812:
+	int	(*set_capabilities)(struct nfs_server *, struct nfs_fh *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct nfs_fh *' should also have an identifier name
#58: FILE: include/linux/nfs_xdr.h:812:
+	int	(*set_capabilities)(struct nfs_server *, struct nfs_fh *);
