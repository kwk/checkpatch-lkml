CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:117:
+extern char *kasprintf(gfp_t gfp, const char *fmt, ...)

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __printf(2, 3) over __attribute__((format(printf, 2, 3)))
#64: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:118:
+	__attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#76: FILE: lib/vsprintf.c:853:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)
#88: FILE: lib/vsprintf.c:865:
+	p = kmalloc(len+1, gfp);
 	               ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
