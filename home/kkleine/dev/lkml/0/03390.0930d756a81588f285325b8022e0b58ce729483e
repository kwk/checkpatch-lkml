Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#226: FILE: include/linux/stacktrace.h:11:
+extern void save_stack_trace(struct stack_trace *trace);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
