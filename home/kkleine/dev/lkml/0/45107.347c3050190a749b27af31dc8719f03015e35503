WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'EXTRAVERSION' may be misspelled - perhaps 'EXTROVERSION'?
#36: FILE: Makefile:4:
+EXTRAVERSION = .10
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#63: FILE: fs/udf/super.c:1656:
+	sb->s_maxbytes = 1<<30;
 	                  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <allocExtDesc>
#88: FILE: fs/udf/truncate.c:248:
+			    (bh && extoffset == sizeof(struct allocExtDesc))) {

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#97: FILE: fs/udf/truncate.c:254:
 			}
+			else {

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#97: FILE: fs/udf/truncate.c:254:
+			else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#108: FILE: fs/udf/truncate.c:256:
+				etype = udf_next_aext(inode, &bloc, &extoffset, &eloc, &elen, &bh, 1);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#109: FILE: fs/udf/truncate.c:257:
+				if (etype == (EXT_NOT_RECORDED_NOT_ALLOCATED >> 30))
+				{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
