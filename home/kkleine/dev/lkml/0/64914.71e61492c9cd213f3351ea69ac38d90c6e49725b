WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'panicing' may be misspelled - perhaps 'panicking'?
#29: 
We have reports of OOM killer panicing the system even if there are
                              ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
