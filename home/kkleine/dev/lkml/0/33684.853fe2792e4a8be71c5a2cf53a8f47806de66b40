WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:PATCH_PREFIX: patch prefix '.' exists, appears to be a -p0 patch

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'uptodate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'up-to-date'?
#42: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:393:
+		printk("md: super_written gets error=%d, uptodate=%d\n",
 		                                         ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#42: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:393:
+		printk("md: super_written gets error=%d, uptodate=%d\n",

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'super_written', this function's name, in a string
#42: FILE: drivers/md/md.c:393:
+		printk("md: super_written gets error=%d, uptodate=%d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
