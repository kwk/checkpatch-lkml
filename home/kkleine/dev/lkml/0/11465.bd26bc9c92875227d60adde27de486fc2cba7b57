#41: 
Subject: Enable SPU switch notification to detect currently active SPU tasks.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#60: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spufs/sched.c:87:
+static void notify_spus_active(struct notifier_block * n)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

+}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
