CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#63: FILE: include/linux/taskstats_kern.h:51:
+extern void taskstats_exit(struct task_struct *, int group_dead);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#117: FILE: kernel/taskstats.c:128:
+static void send_cpu_listeners(struct sk_buff *skb,
+					struct listener_list *listeners)
