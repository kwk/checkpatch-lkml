+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ipath_set_lid);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct ipath_devdata *' should also have an identifier name
#116: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_layer.h:132:
+int ipath_set_lid(struct ipath_devdata *, u32, u8);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'u32' should also have an identifier name
#116: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_layer.h:132:
+int ipath_set_lid(struct ipath_devdata *, u32, u8);
