#27: 
task_struct->state == EXIT_DEAD is a very special case, to avoid a confusion

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#86: FILE: kernel/sched.c:5119:
+	BUG_ON(p->state == TASK_DEAD);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'p->state != TASK_DEAD'
#97: FILE: mm/oom_kill.c:209:
+		if (releasing && (p->state != TASK_DEAD))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
