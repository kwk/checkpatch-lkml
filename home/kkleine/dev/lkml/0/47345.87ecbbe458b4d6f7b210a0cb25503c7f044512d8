Subject: [RFC][PATCH 2/3] PM: Make console suspending configureable
                                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#67: FILE: kernel/power/Kconfig:39:
+config PM_DISABLE_CONSOLE_SUSPEND
+	bool "Keep console(s) enabled during suspend/resume (DANGEROUS)"
+	depends on PM && PM_DEBUG
+	default n
+	---help---
+	This option turns off the console suspend mechanism that prevents
+	debug messages from reaching the console during the suspend/resume
+	operations.  This may be helpful when debugging device drivers'
+	suspend/resume routines, but may itself lead to problems, for example
+	if netconsole is used.
+
 config PM_TRACE
 	bool "Suspend/resume event tracing"
 	depends on PM && PM_DEBUG && X86_32 && EXPERIMENTAL

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#97: FILE: kernel/printk.c:713:
+	printk("Suspending console(s)\n");
