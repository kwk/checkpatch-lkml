#29: 
Port two patches from i386 to x86_64 delay.c to make sure all rounding is done

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 106 exceeds 100 columns
#66: FILE: arch/x86_64/lib/delay.c:43:
+	__delay((xloops * HZ * cpu_data[raw_smp_processor_id()].loops_per_jiffy + (1UL << 32) - 1) >> 32);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
