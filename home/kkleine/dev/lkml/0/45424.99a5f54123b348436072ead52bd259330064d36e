Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:DEPRECATED_API: Deprecated use of 'call_rcu_bh', prefer 'call_rcu' instead
#151: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:316:
+	call_rcu_bh(&rcu.head, rcu_bh_torture_wakeme_after_cb);

Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.

The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'rcu_torture_fakewriter', this function's name, in a string
#198: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:492:
+	VERBOSE_PRINTK_STRING("rcu_torture_fakewriter task started");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
