CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#104: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:199:
+extern int select_notick_load_balancer(int cpu);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#151: FILE: kernel/sched.c:1044:
 }
+static void resched_cpu(int cpu)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#217: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2964:
+		if (notick.load_balancer == -1) {
[...]
+		} else if (notick.load_balancer == cpu)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#231: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2978:
+				BUG();

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
#276: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3030:
+	next_balance = jiffies + 60*HZ;
 	                           ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#283: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3037:
+		if (idle_cpu(local_cpu) && notick.load_balancer == local_cpu
+		    && need_resched())

WARNING:NR_CPUS: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
#318: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3683:
