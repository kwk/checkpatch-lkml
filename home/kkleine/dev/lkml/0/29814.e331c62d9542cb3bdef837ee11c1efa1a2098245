CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#280: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs3xdr.c:526:
+	kaddr = p = kmap_atomic(*page, KM_USER0);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#309: FILE: fs/nfs/nfs3xdr.c:668:
+nfs3_xdr_setaclargs(struct rpc_rqst *req, __be32 *p,
                    struct nfs3_setaclargs *args)
