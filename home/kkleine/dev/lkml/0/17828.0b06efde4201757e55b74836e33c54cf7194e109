WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

+config USB_TOUCHSCREEN_DMC_TSC10

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'controler' may be misspelled - perhaps 'controller'?

                                     ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#131: FILE: drivers/usb/input/usbtouchscreen.c:330:
+ * slowest rate to fastest rate. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

+                          __u8 requesttype, __u8 request, __u16 value,$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#156: FILE: drivers/usb/input/usbtouchscreen.c:355:
+	buf[0] = buf[1] = 0xFF;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:LONG_LINE_COMMENT: line length of 108 exceeds 100 columns
#157: FILE: drivers/usb/input/usbtouchscreen.c:356:
+	//dbg("bmRequest %02x bRequest %02x wValue %04x wLength %04x", requesttype, request, value, retlen);

A comment starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
