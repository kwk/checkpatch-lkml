The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#204: FILE: init/Kconfig:421:
+config PAGE_SLAB
+	default n
+	depends on MODULAR_SLAB
+	bool "Page slab allocator"
+	help
+	  The page slab allocator is a form of slab allocator but it manges
+	  page in order of pagesize through the page allocator. This allows
+	  for efficient management of slab caches with huge objects.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
