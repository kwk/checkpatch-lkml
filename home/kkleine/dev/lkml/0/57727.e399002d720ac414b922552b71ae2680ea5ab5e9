ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#60: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis.c:445:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#167: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis.c:690:
+	if (force) {
[...]
+	else 
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#171: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis.c:694:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#171: FILE: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis.c:694:

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
