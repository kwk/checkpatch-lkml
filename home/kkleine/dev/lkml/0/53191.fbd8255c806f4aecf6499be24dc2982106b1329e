Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#130: FILE: net/sunrpc/svcsock.c:1240:
+	if ((svsk = svc_sock_dequeue(serv)) != NULL) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'svc_age_temp_sockets', this function's name, in a string
#164: FILE: net/sunrpc/svcsock.c:1356:
+	dprintk("svc_age_temp_sockets\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'svc_age_temp_sockets', this function's name, in a string

+		dprintk("svc_age_temp_sockets: busy\n");

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!serv->sv_temptimer.function"
#212: FILE: net/sunrpc/svcsock.c:1449:
+		if (serv->sv_temptimer.function == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
