CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#78: FILE: drivers/s390/crypto/ap_bus.c:779:
+		if (!rc) {
[...]
+		else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#83: FILE: drivers/s390/crypto/ap_bus.c:784:
+		}
+		else

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
