CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: include/linux/list.h:53:
+extern void __list_add(struct list_head *new,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
