CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#166: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:197:
+	if (is_metered(cs)) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#183: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:214:
+	quota = simple_strtoul(buf, NULL, 10);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

Do not use assignments in if condition.

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#416: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:56:
+extern void *cpu_ctlr_data(struct cpuset *cs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
