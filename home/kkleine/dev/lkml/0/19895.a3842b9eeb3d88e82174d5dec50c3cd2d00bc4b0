The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

#208: FILE: kernel/bc/rsspages.c:52:

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
