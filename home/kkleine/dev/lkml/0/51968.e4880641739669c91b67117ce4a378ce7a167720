WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#59: FILE: kernel/sys.c:519:
+	BUG_ON(init_srcu_struct(&nh->srcu) < 0);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:RETURN_PARENTHESES: return is not a function, parentheses are not required
#78: FILE: kernel/srcu.c:50:
+	return (sp->per_cpu_ref ? 0 : -ENOMEM);

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;
