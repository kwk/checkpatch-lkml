ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#43: 
--- a/fs/debugfs/inode.c

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#59: FILE: fs/debugfs/inode.c:59:
+			 * (for "." entry) */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#115: FILE: fs/debugfs/inode.c:211:
+	error = simple_pin_fs(&debug_fs_type, &debugfs_mount,
+		&debugfs_mount_count);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#142: FILE: fs/debugfs/inode.c:292:
+			if (S_ISDIR(dentry->d_inode->i_mode)) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
