WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#52: FILE: net/sunrpc/auth_gss/svcauth_gss.c:907:
+	 * for use in encryption/checksumming in svcauth_gss_release: */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!gsd->verf_start"
#122: FILE: net/sunrpc/auth_gss/svcauth_gss.c:1292:
+	if (gsd->verf_start == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
