The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!call_firmware"
#260: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/callofw.c:27:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)

#267: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/callofw.c:34:
+	if ((numargs + numres) > MAXARGS) {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of

constructs like::

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
