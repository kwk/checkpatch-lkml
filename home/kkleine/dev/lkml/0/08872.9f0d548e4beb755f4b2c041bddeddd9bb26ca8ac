WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#51: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/ipl.c:998:
+extern __u32 dump_prefix_page;

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#60: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/ipl.c:1010:
+	dump_prefix_page = (unsigned long) lc;

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
