WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'raid5_align_endio', this function's name, in a string
#122: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:2715:
+	PRINTK("raid5_align_endio : io error...handing IO for a retry\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
