CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#67: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:100:
+extern int insert_resource(struct resource *parent, struct resource *new);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
