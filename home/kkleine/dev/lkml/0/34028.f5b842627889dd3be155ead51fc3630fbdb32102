The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#57: FILE: include/linux/cpu_acct.h:8:
+extern void cpuacct_charge(struct task_struct *, cputime_t cputime);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#68: FILE: init/Kconfig:243:

+	depends on CONTAINERS
+	help
+	  Provides a simple Resource Controller for monitoring the

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#85: FILE: kernel/cpu_acct.c:2:

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

#112: FILE: kernel/cpu_acct.c:29:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#112: FILE: kernel/cpu_acct.c:29:

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#156: FILE: kernel/cpu_acct.c:73:
+void cpuacct_charge(struct task_struct *task, cputime_t cputime) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#157: FILE: kernel/cpu_acct.c:74:
+void cpuacct_charge(struct task_struct *task, cputime_t cputime) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
