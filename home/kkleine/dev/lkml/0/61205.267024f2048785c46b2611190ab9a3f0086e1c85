WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#141: FILE: Makefile:865:
+include/linux/version.h: $(srctree)/Makefile FORCE

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#296: FILE: include/linux/vermagic.h:1:
+#include <linux/utsrelease.h>

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.
