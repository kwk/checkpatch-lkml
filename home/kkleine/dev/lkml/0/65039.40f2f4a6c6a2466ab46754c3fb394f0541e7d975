ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#223: FILE: net/8021q/vlanproc.c:261:
+	for (dev = vlan_skip(first_netdev()); dev && i < *pos; 
+	     dev = vlan_skip(next_netdev(dev)), ++i);
 		

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1399671106.2912.21.camel@joe-AO725/

ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#223: FILE: net/8021q/vlanproc.c:261:
+	for (dev = vlan_skip(first_netdev()); dev && i < *pos; 
+	     dev = vlan_skip(next_netdev(dev)), ++i);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;
