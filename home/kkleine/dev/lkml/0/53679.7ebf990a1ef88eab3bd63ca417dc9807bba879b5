CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#118: FILE: include/net/ipv6.h:471:
+extern int			ip6_sk_dst_lookup(struct sock *sk,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
