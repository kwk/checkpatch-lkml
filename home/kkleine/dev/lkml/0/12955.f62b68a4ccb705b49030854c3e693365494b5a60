WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 101 exceeds 100 columns
#49: FILE: ipc/sem.c:1073:
+	new = (struct sem_undo *) kzalloc(sizeof(struct sem_undo) + sizeof(short)*nsems, GFP_KERNEL);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*new)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct sem_undo)...)
#49: FILE: ipc/sem.c:1073:
+	new = (struct sem_undo *) kzalloc(sizeof(struct sem_undo) + sizeof(short)*nsems, GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
