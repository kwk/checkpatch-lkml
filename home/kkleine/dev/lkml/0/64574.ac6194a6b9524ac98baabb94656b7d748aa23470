CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#43: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:421:
+	if ((test_action_state(SUSPEND_KEEP_IMAGE)) &&
+	     test_suspend_state(SUSPEND_NOW_RESUMING))

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#48: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_file.c:426:
+	header_pages = main_pages = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
