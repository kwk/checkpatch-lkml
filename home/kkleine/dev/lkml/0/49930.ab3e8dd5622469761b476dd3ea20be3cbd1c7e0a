WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#62: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c:387:
+		if (!(freq->flags & CPUFREQ_CONST_LOOPS)) {
+			tsc_khz = cpu_khz;
+		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#87: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c:1013:

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#178: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c:1104:
+		(void __iomem*)ioremap_nocache(hpet_address, HPET_MMAP_SIZE);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#213: FILE: include/asm-x86_64/timex.h:45:
+extern void mark_tsc_unstable(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
