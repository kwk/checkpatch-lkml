Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#66: FILE: drivers/net/Kconfig:2088:
+config R8169_SYSERR_DISABLE
+	bool "Disable reporting of the PCI SysErr"
+	depends on R8169 && ARCH_IOP32X
+	---help---
+	  Without this option, the driver reports a lot of PCI SysErr and
+	  is completely unusable with the Thecus N2100. As an alternate
+	  solution, you can use the 'ignore_parity_err' parameter of the
+	  r8169 module to cure the problem at runtime.
+
+	  If in doubt, say N.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
