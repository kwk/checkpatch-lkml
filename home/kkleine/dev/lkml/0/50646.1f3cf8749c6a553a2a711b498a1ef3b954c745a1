#29: 
In addition this patch sets the default size and address of the initrd to 0.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#139: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/setup.c:506:
+	end_pfn = max_pfn = PFN_DOWN(memory_end);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
