 static void __devinit at91_init_port(struct at91_uart_port *at91_port, struct platform_device *pdev)

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 110 exceeds 100 columns

+		at91_init_port(&(at91_ports[atmel_default_console_device->id]), atmel_default_console_device);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around at91_ports[atmel_default_console_device->id]
#172: FILE: drivers/serial/atmel_serial.c:839:
+		at91_init_port(&(at91_ports[atmel_default_console_device->id]), atmel_default_console_device);

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#203: FILE: include/asm-arm/arch-at91rm9200/board.h:100:
 };
+extern struct platform_device *atmel_default_console_device;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
