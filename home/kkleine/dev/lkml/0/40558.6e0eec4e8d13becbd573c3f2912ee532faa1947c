This patch is against a recent git clone of Linus's tree.  This patch adds the

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#49: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:2308:
+^I * if an io address is specified set the port's iobase to the $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#58: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:2317:
+		unsigned long iobase = 0;
+		if ((ioptr = strstr(options, "io=")) != NULL) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#58: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:2317:
+		if ((ioptr = strstr(options, "io=")) != NULL) {

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:CONSIDER_KSTRTO: simple_strtoul is obsolete, use kstrtoul instead
#59: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:2318:
+			iobase = simple_strtoul(ioptr+3, NULL, 16);

The simple_strtol(), simple_strtoll(), simple_strtoul(), and
simple_strtoull() functions explicitly ignore overflows, which
may lead to unexpected results in callers.  The respective kstrtol(),
kstrtoll(), kstrtoul(), and kstrtoull() functions tend to be the
correct replacements.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#60: FILE: drivers/serial/8250.c:2319:
+			if (ioptr == options) {
[...]
+			} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
