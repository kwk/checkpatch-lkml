WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#38: FILE: include/linux/skbuff.h:1341:
+extern int	       skb_splice_bits(const struct sk_buff *skb, int offset,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#39: FILE: include/linux/skbuff.h:1342:
+extern int	       skb_splice_bits(const struct sk_buff *skb, int offset,
+				     struct pipe_inode_info *pipe, int len, unsigned int flags);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct pipe_buf_operations should normally be const
#60: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:75:
+static struct pipe_buf_operations sock_buf_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 117 exceeds 100 columns
#81: FILE: net/core/skbuff.c:1167:
+int skb_splice_bits(const struct sk_buff *skb, int offset, struct pipe_inode_info *pipe, int len, unsigned int flags)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be

Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:DEEP_INDENTATION: Too many leading tabs - consider code refactoring

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
code.

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
