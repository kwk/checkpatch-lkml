WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#69: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c:759:
+		 * specifically set */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#72: FILE: drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c:762:
+		/* fall through */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.
