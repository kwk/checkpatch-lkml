+	/* Reject out-of-range values early.  Large positive sizes are

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented

It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
