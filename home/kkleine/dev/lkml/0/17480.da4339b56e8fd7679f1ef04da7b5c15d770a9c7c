CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#56: FILE: include/linux/platform_device.h:64:
+extern int platform_driver_probe(struct platform_driver *driver,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#57: FILE: include/linux/platform_device.h:65:
+extern int platform_driver_probe(struct platform_driver *driver,
+		int (*probe)(struct platform_device *));

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#100: FILE: drivers/base/platform.c:477:
+int platform_driver_probe(struct platform_driver *drv,
+		int (*probe)(struct platform_device *))

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#106: FILE: drivers/base/platform.c:483:
+	retval = code = platform_driver_register(drv);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
