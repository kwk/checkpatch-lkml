WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#16: 
Subject: Re: [PATCH] sparse fix: add many lock annotations

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#397: FILE: include/asm-i386/smp.h:41:
+extern void lock_ipi_call_lock(void) __acquires(call_lock);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void' should also have an identifier name
#397: FILE: include/asm-i386/smp.h:41:
+extern void lock_ipi_call_lock(void) __acquires(call_lock);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
