WARNING:EMAIL_SUBJECT: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool that found it
#22: 
Subject: [PATCH] Add Sparse annotations to QRCU lock functions and rcutorture

Naming the tool that found the issue is not very useful in the
subject line.  A good subject line summarizes the change that
the patch brings.

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#60: FILE: kernel/rcutorture.c:70:
+++ b/kernel/rcutorture.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
