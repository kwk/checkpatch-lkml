ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#103: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spider-pic.c:370:
 			static long hard_coded_pics[] =
+				{ 0x24000008000ul, 0x34000008000ul};

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
