ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#106: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.c:26:
+static int need_reprobe = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:EXPORT_SYMBOL: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#173: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.c:403:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(css_schedule_reprobe);

EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.

WARNING:INCLUDE_LINUX: Use #include <linux/atomic.h> instead of <asm/atomic.h>
#200: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device.h:5:
+#include <asm/atomic.h>

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#222: FILE: include/asm-s390/cio.h:279:
+extern void css_schedule_reprobe(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
