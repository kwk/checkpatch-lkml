CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'schib.pmcw.dev != sch->schib.pmcw.dev'
#62: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.c:191:
+	if (sch->schib.pmcw.dnv && (schib.pmcw.dev != sch->schib.pmcw.dev))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#142: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.c:232:
+		/* fall through */

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#263: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.c:303:
+	CIO_MSG_EVENT(4, "Evaluating schid 0.%x.%04x, event %d, unknown, "
+			 "slow path.\n", schid.ssid, schid.sch_no, CIO_OPER);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#274: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.c:314:
+	if (sch) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
