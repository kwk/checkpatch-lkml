WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#124: FILE: drivers/net/spider_net.c:711:
+	 * need to be precise -- does not need a lock. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#199: FILE: drivers/net/spider_net.c:812:
+			int len = skb->len < ETH_ZLEN ? ETH_ZLEN : skb->len;
+			pci_unmap_single(card->pdev, buf_addr, len, PCI_DMA_TODEVICE);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
