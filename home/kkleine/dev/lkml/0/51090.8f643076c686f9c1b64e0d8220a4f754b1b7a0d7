Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'lock_cpu_hotplug', this function's name, in a string
#59: FILE: kernel/cpu.c:35:
+		printk ("CPU%d called lock_cpu_hotplug() for app %s. recursive_depth=%d\n",

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
