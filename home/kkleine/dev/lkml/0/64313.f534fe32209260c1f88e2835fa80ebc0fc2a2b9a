ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#52: FILE: kernel/power/atomic_copy.c:62:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#53: FILE: kernel/power/atomic_copy.c:63:
+	zone_nosave = (struct zone_data *) suspend_get_nonconflicting_page();

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#55: FILE: kernel/power/atomic_copy.c:65:
+	BUG_ON(!zone_nosave);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
