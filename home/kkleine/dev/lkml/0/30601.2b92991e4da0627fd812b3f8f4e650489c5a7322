*  The check_partition() stops its probe once it hits an I/O error from the partition checkers. This would prevent the actual partition checker getting a chance to verify the partition. So, this patch lets the check_partition continue probing untill it hits a success while recording the I/O error which might have been reported by the checking routines.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#113: FILE: fs/partitions/check.c:168:
+	i = res = err = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#119: FILE: fs/partitions/check.c:174:
+^I^I ^I* But record it, and let the others do their job.$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#119: FILE: fs/partitions/check.c:174:

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments should align the * on each line
#119: FILE: fs/partitions/check.c:174:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
