WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#78: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:805:
+			printk("Local APIC disabled by BIOS (or by default) -- "

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#87: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:1355:
+	 * out here. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
#89: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:1357:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "Local APIC disabled by default -- "

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#90: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:1358:
+		printk(KERN_INFO "Local APIC disabled by default -- "
+		       "use 'lapic' to enable it.\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations
#121: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:2897:
+}
+early_param("apic", parse_apic);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
