ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#52: 
--- a/include/linux/tty.h	2006-06-09 09:33:16.000000000 -0500

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'flush_to_ldisc', this function's name, in a string
#71: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2789:
+		printk(KERN_ERR"flush_to_ldisc - TTY_DONT_FLIP set\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:CONCATENATED_STRING: Concatenated strings should use spaces between elements
#71: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2789:
+		printk(KERN_ERR"flush_to_ldisc - TTY_DONT_FLIP set\n");

Concatenated elements should have a space in between.
Example::

  printk(KERN_INFO"bar");

should be::

  printk(KERN_INFO "bar");

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 104 exceeds 100 columns
#76: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2794:
+		printk(KERN_ERR"flush_to_ldisc - TTY_FLUSHING set, low_latency=%d\n", tty->low_latency);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
