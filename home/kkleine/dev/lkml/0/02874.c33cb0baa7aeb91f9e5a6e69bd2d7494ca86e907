Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#176: FILE: arch/i386/pci/pci.h:104:
+extern int __init pci_mmcfg_arch_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'cfg->start_bus_number <= bus'

+		if (cfg->pci_segment_group_number == seg &&
+		    (cfg->start_bus_number <= bus) &&
 		    (cfg->end_bus_number >= bus))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
