> >>We add a save link for O_DIRECT writes to protect the i_size against the crashes before we actually finish the I/O. If we hit an -ENOSPC in aops->prepare_write(), we would do a truncate() to release the blocks which might have got initialized. Now the truncate would add another save link for the same inode causing a reiserfs panic for having multiple save links for the same inode.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'bufferred' may be misspelled - perhaps 'buffered'?
#59: 
I am not sure why it was needed. I guess that if long append (direct of bufferred) did not complete - it is ok if file becomes longer than it was before.
