#84: 
Fix sched-domains partitioning by cpusets. Walk the whole cpusets tree after

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#103: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:762:
+		if (is_cpu_exclusive(c)) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#106: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:765:
+				cpus_andnot(*non_partitioned,
+					*non_partitioned, c->cpus_allowed);

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#165: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:790:
+	BUG_ON(!mutex_is_locked(&manage_mutex));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#208: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1073:
+                update_cpu_domains();$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#208: FILE: kernel/cpuset.c:1073:

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#337: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:710:
+extern int partition_sched_domains(cpumask_t *partition);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
