WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'start_kernel', this function's name, in a string
#49: FILE: init/main.c:542:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "start_kernel(): bug: interrupts were enabled *very* early, fixing it\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
