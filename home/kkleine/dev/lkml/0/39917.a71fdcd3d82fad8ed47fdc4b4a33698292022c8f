WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#34: 
#define SetPageUptodate(_page)

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'seperate' may be misspelled - perhaps 'separate'?
#48: 
seperate header file for the struct page definition.
^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#163: FILE: include/linux/page-struct.h:1:
+#ifndef _LINUX_PAGE_STRUCT_H

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#182: FILE: include/linux/page-struct.h:20:
+					 * updated asynchronously */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
