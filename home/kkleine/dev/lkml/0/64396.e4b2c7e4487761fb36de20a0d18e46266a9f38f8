CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#44: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:111:
+extern int snprintf_used(char *buffer, int buffer_size,

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#45: FILE: include/linux/kernel.h:112:

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#60: FILE: lib/vsprintf.c:242:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
