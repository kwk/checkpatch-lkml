CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <AdapterControlBlock>
#42: FILE: drivers/scsi/arcmsr/arcmsr.h:471:
+extern void arcmsr_free_sysfs_attr(struct AdapterControlBlock *acb);

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#42: FILE: drivers/scsi/arcmsr/arcmsr.h:471:
+extern void arcmsr_free_sysfs_attr(struct AdapterControlBlock *acb);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
