Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!atalk_table_header"
#73: FILE: net/appletalk/sysctl_net_atalk.c:77:
+	return (atalk_table_header == NULL) ? -ENOMEM : 0;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#159: FILE: include/linux/atalk.h:150:
+extern int aarp_proto_init(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#168: FILE: include/linux/atalk.h:193:
