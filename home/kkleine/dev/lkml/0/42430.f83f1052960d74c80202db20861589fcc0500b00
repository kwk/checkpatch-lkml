WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after boot_pda
#92: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:715:
+	static const __initdata struct i386_pda boot_pda;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of const init definition must use __initconst
#92: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:715:
+	static const __initdata struct i386_pda boot_pda;

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
