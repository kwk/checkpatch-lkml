#24: 
Use kzalloc instad of kmalloc+memset(0).
            ^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*mtd)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct mtd_info)...)
#47: FILE: drivers/mtd/devices/pmc551.c:735:
+		mtd = kzalloc(sizeof(struct mtd_info), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
