ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#45: FILE: airprime.c:22:
+       { USB_DEVICE(0x1410, 0x1130) }, /* Novatel Wireless S720$

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#47: FILE: airprime.c:23:
+       { USB_DEVICE(0x1410, 0x1130) }, /* Novatel Wireless S720
+       { USB_DEVICE(0x1410, 0x2110) }, /* Novatel Wireless U720

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
