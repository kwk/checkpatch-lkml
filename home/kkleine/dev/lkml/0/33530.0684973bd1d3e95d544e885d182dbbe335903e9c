CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <MmioAddress>
#118: FILE: drivers/scsi/nsp32.c:3544:

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!instance"
#144: FILE: drivers/scsi/seagate.c:496:
+	if (instance == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#147: FILE: drivers/scsi/seagate.c:499:
+		st0x_cr_sr = st0x_dr = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#178: FILE: drivers/scsi/sun3_scsi.c:243:
+		 iounmap((void*)ioaddr);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
