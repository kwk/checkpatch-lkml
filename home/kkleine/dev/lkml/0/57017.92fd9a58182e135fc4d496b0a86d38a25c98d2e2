ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#61: 
--- a/drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c~a

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#67: FILE: drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c:167:
+#define D() printk("%s:%d\n", __FILE__, __LINE__);

WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: macros should not use a trailing semicolon
#67: FILE: drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c:167:
+#define D() printk("%s:%d\n", __FILE__, __LINE__);

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
