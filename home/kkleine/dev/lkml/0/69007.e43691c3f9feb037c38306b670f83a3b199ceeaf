ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#60: 
--- a/sound/core/pcm_native.c	Tue Jun 13 12:01:14 2006 +0200

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#78: FILE: sound/core/pcm_native.c:3174:
+static struct vm_operations_struct snd_pcm_vm_ops_data_one_map =

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.10.1608281509480.3321@hadrien/

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#79: FILE: sound/core/pcm_native.c:3175:
+static struct vm_operations_struct snd_pcm_vm_ops_data_one_map =
+{

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
