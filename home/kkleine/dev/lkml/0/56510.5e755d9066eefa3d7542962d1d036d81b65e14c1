WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'tc_dump_action', this function's name, in a string
#102: FILE: net/sched/act_api.c:837:
+		printk("tc_dump_action: %s !capable of dumping table\n", a_o->kind);

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
