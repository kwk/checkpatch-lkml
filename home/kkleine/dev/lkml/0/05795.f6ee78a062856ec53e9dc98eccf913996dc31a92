CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'iblock >= inode_blocks'
#91: FILE: fs/ocfs2/aops.c:559:
+	if (!create && (iblock >= inode_blocks)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:SYMBOLIC_PERMS: Symbolic permissions 'S_IRUGO | S_IRUSR' are not preferred. Consider using octal permissions '0444'.
#131: FILE: fs/ocfs2/cluster/heartbeat.c:1500:
+                   .ca_mode = S_IRUGO | S_IRUSR },

Permission bits in the octal form are more readable and easier to
understand than their symbolic counterparts because many command-line
tools use this notation. Experienced kernel developers have been using
these traditional Unix permission bits for decades and so they find it
easier to understand the octal notation than the symbolic macros.
For example, it is harder to read S_IWUSR|S_IRUGO than 0644, which
obscures the developer's intent rather than clarifying it.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vfsmnt"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
