+	 * slot will get. make sure it isn't 0 */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

#217: FILE: fs/ext4/balloc.c:1913:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*rs)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct ext4_reservation_slot)...)
#286: FILE: fs/ext4/balloc.c:1982:
+	rs = kmalloc(sizeof(struct ext4_reservation_slot) * NR_CPUS, GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!rs"

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
