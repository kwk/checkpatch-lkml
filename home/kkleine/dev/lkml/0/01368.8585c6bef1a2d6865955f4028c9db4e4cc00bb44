#36: 
If all of the cpusets memory is dirty then only 10% of total memory is dirty.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#109: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:133:
+get_dirty_limits(struct dirty_limits *dl, struct address_space *mapping,
+		nodemask_t *nodes)

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#153: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:176:
+	} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.
