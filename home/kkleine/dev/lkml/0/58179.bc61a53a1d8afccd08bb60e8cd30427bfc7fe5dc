ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#52: FILE: include/linux/string.h:88:
+extern void * memcpy_cachebypass(void *,const void *,__kernel_size_t);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#52: FILE: include/linux/string.h:88:
+extern void * memcpy_cachebypass(void *,const void *,__kernel_size_t);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

+ * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,$

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph
directing people to write to the FSF for a copy of the GPL, since the
FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's
mailing address.
