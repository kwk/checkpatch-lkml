ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#64: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_block_io.c:292:
+		int result;
+		first = list_entry(ioinfo_ready_for_cleanup.next,

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#65: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_block_io.c:293:
+		first = list_entry(ioinfo_ready_for_cleanup.next,
+				struct io_info, list);

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#67: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_block_io.c:295:
+		BUG_ON(!test_and_clear_bit(IO_AWAITING_CLEANUP, &first->flags));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on
