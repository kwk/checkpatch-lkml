CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#72: FILE: include/linux/timex.h:292:
+extern u64 ntp_interval_length(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
