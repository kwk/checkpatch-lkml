WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#54: FILE: lib/kobject.c:424:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "kobject_add_dir: "

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'kobject_add_dir', this function's name, in a string
#54: FILE: lib/kobject.c:424:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "kobject_add_dir: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#55: FILE: lib/kobject.c:425:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "kobject_add_dir: "
+			"kobject_register error: %d\n", ret);

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
