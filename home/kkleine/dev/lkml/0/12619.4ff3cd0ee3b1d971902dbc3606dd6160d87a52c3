ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#50: FILE: arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c:120:
+void *xquad_portio = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
