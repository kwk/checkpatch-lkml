#26: 
release methode for area->pages. It may be too small when
        ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#70: FILE: mm/vmalloc.c:430:
+	if (array_size > PAGE_SIZE) {
[...]
+		area->flags |= VM_VPAGES;
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
