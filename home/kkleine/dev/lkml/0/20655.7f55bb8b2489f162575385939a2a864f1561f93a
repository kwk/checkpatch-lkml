ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line
#52: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2922:
+static DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct tasklet_struct, rebalance) =
+		{ NULL, 0, ATOMIC_INIT(0), rebalance_domains, 0L };

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
