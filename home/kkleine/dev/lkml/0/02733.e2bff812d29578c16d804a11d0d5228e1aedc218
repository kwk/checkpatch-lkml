ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#94: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:782:
+static struct pci_devres * get_pci_dr(struct pci_dev *pdev)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
