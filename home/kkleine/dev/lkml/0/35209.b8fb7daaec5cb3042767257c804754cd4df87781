WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'wil' may be misspelled - perhaps 'will'?

From: Matthew Wilcox <matthew@wil.cx>
                              ^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#98: FILE: include/asm-m32r/spinlock.h:303:
+	atomic_t *count = (atomic_t*)lock;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#99: FILE: include/asm-m32r/spinlock.h:304:
+	atomic_t *count = (atomic_t*)lock;
+	if (atomic_dec_return(count) >= 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
