WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#34: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#39: FILE: kernel/power/netlink.h:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#40: FILE: kernel/power/netlink.h:2:
+ * kernel/power/netlink.h

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#63: FILE: kernel/power/netlink.h:25:
+	int (*rcv_msg) (struct sk_buff *skb, struct nlmsghdr *nlh);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer name
#64: FILE: kernel/power/netlink.h:26:

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#74: FILE: kernel/power/netlink.h:36:
+^Iint netlink_id;^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#82: FILE: kernel/power/netlink.h:44:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#87: FILE: kernel/power/netlink.h:49:
+void suspend_send_netlink_message(struct user_helper_data *uhd,
+		int type, void* params, size_t len);

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#87: FILE: kernel/power/netlink.h:49:
+		int type, void* params, size_t len);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
