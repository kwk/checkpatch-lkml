#50: 
Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#62: 
--- a/drivers/kvm/paging_tmpl.h	(revision 4270)

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
