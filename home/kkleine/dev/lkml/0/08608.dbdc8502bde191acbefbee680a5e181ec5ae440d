ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#55: FILE: net/netfilter/x_tables.c:215:
+	if(IS_ERR(match) || match == NULL)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!match"
#55: FILE: net/netfilter/x_tables.c:215:
+	if(IS_ERR(match) || match == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
