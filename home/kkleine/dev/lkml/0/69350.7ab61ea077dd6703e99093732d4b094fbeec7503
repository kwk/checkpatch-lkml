CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#90: FILE: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:233:
+	tty->driver_data = port->tty = NULL;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
