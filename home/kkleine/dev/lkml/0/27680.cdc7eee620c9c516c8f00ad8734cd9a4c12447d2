ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#35: FILE: drivers/video/igafb.c:387:
+        pdev = pci_get_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTERG, $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#35: FILE: drivers/video/igafb.c:387:
+        pdev = pci_get_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTERG, $

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#35: FILE: drivers/video/igafb.c:387:
+        pdev = pci_get_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTERG, $

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#36: FILE: drivers/video/igafb.c:388:
+        pdev = pci_get_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTERG, 
                                PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTERG_1682, 0);

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#43: FILE: drivers/video/igafb.c:394:

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#50: FILE: drivers/video/igafb.c:401:
+	/* We leak a reference here but as it cannot be unloaded this is
+	   fine. If you write unload code remember to free it in unload */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
