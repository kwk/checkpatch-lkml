CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#53: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:325:
+extern fastcall unsigned int __do_IRQ_deprecated(unsigned int irq, struct pt_regs *regs);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
