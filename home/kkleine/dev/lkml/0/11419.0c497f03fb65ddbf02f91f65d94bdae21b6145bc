WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#57: 
#error will detect this.

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#59: 
Signed-Off-By: KAMEZAWA Hiruyoki <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#274: FILE: include/linux/mmzone.h:621:
+extern struct page* mem_map;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
