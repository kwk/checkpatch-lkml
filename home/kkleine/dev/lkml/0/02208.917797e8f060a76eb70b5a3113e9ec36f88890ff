CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*new_slave)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct slave)...)
#81: FILE: drivers/net/bonding/bond_main.c:1339:
+	new_slave = kzalloc(sizeof(struct slave), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
