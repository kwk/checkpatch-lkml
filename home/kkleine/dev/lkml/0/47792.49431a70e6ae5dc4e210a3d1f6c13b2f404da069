#21: 
This is the revised version, which fixes the wrong type declaration of new functions

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#46: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:140:
+extern long hrtimer_nanosleep_restart(struct restart_block *restart_block);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:SPACING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
#58: FILE: include/linux/posix-timers.h:75:
+	long (*nsleep_restart) (struct restart_block *restart_block);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
