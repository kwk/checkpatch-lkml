WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 109 exceeds 100 columns
#118: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/pci_sabre.c:1199:
+static void sabre_pbm_init(struct pci_controller_info *p, struct device_node *dp, u32 dma_start, u32 dma_end)

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
