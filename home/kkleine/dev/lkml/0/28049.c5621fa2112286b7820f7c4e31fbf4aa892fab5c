WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#50: FILE: drivers/input/misc/hp_sdc_rtc.c:388:
+static ssize_t hp_sdc_rtc_read(struct file *file, char __user *buf,
 			       size_t count, loff_t *ppos) {

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#67: FILE: drivers/input/misc/hp_sdc_rtc.c:699:
+        create_proc_read_entry ("driver/rtc", 0, NULL,$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#67: FILE: drivers/input/misc/hp_sdc_rtc.c:699:
+        create_proc_read_entry ("driver/rtc", 0, NULL,$

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#67: FILE: drivers/input/misc/hp_sdc_rtc.c:699:
+        create_proc_read_entry ("driver/rtc", 0, NULL,

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 107 exceeds 100 columns
#86: FILE: drivers/input/serio/hil_mlc.c:398:
+{ HILSE_CTS,		{ .packet = 0    }, 0, HILSEN_NEXT | HILSEN_SCHED | HILSEN_BREAK, HILSEN_DOZE, 0 },

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
