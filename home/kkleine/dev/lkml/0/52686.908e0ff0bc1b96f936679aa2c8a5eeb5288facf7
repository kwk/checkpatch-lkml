WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'topology_init', this function's name, in a string
#55: FILE: arch/ia64/kernel/topology.c:71:
+		panic("kzalloc in topology_init failed - NR_CPUS too big?");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
