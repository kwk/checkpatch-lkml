Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#69: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2893:
+      ^I__get_cpu_var(next_balance) = next_balance;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#69: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2893:
+      ^I__get_cpu_var(next_balance) = next_balance;$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#69: FILE: kernel/sched.c:2893:
+      ^I__get_cpu_var(next_balance) = next_balance;$

WARNING:JIFFIES_COMPARISON: Comparing jiffies is almost always wrong; prefer time_after, time_before and friends
