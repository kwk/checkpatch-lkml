CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#41: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:35:
+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_CLOCK_BEFORE_RESET			(1<<0)
                                       			  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#41: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:35:
+#define SDHCI_QUIRK_CLOCK_BEFORE_RESET			(1<<0)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:HOTPLUG_SECTION: Using __devinitdata is unnecessary
#43: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:37:
 static const struct pci_device_id pci_ids[] __devinitdata = {

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#65: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:823:
 		(mrq->data->stop && (mrq->data->stop->error != MMC_ERR_NONE))))) {
+

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#77: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:835:
+		/* Spec says we should do both at the same time, but Ricoh
+		   controllers do not like that. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#77: FILE: drivers/mmc/sdhci.c:835:
+		   controllers do not like that. */
