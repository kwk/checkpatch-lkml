ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#54: 
--- a/include/linux/mm.h~nommu-move-the-fallback-arch_vma_name-to-a-sensible-place-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
