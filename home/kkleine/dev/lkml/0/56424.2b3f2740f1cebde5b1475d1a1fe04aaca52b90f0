ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#89: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-calgary.c:115:
+void* tce_table_kva[MAX_PHB_BUS_NUM];

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
