#30: 
Description: In function se401_stop_stream() [drivers/media/video/se401.c], se401->sbuf[i].data was freed only when se401->urb[i] existed. This could result in a memory leak because sbuf[i].data is allocated before urb[i]. Hence, if the memory gets exhausted while allocating for sbuf[i], the urb[i] would still be NULL, and this would result in sbuf[i] not getting freed when se401_stop_stream() is called.
