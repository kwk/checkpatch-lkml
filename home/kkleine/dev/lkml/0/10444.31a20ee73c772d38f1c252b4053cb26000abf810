#36: 
Please note I compiled, and boot tested on ia32 this patch, and it seems OK.

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#43: 
# nm vmlinux | grep ' V '

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

ERROR:WEAK_DECLARATION: Using weak declarations can have unintended link defects
#89: FILE: include/linux/time.h:93:

Using weak declarations like __attribute__((weak)) or __weak
can have unintended link defects.  Avoid using them.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#89: FILE: include/linux/time.h:93:
+extern seqlock_t xtime_lock __attribute__((weak));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
