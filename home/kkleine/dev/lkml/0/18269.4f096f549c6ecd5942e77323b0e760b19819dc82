CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#67: FILE: include/linux/kobject.h:50:
+	KOBJ_MOVE	= (__force kobject_action_t) 0x08,	/* device move */

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "string"
#150: FILE: lib/kobject_uevent.c:132:
+	if (string != NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:BRACKET_SPACE: space prohibited before open square bracket '['
#151: FILE: lib/kobject_uevent.c:133:
+		envp [i++] = scratch;

Whitespace before opening bracket '[' is prohibited.
There are some exceptions:

1. With a type on the left::

    int [] a;

2. At the beginning of a line for slice initialisers::

    [0...10] = 5,

3. Inside a curly brace::

    = { [0...10] = 5 }
