CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#126: FILE: kernel/acct.c:528:
+	pacct->ac_utime = pacct->ac_stime = cputime_zero;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
