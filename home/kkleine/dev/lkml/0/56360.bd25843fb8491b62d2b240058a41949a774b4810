The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#104: FILE: drivers/xen/core/reboot.c:49:
+void machine_restart(char * __unused)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#201: FILE: drivers/xen/core/reboot.c:146:

[...]
+	else if (strcmp(str, "suspend") == 0)
[...]
+	else if (strcmp(str, "halt") == 0)
[...]
+	else {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
