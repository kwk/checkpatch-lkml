WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct ethtool_ops should normally be const
#104: FILE: drivers/net/ehea/ehea_ethtool.c:273:
+struct ethtool_ops ehea_ethtool_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
