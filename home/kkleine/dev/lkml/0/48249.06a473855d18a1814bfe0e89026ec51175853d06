CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#139: FILE: net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c:120:
+	w->prev = w->next = w;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
