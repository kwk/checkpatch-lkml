WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#47: FILE: Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt:390:
+<<<<<<< HEAD/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.
