WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#173: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:594:
+			BUG_ON(!bio);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#211: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:828:
+	lo->lo_thread = kthread_create(loop_thread, lo, "loop%d",
+						lo->lo_number);

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Lo_bound>
#219: FILE: drivers/block/loop.c:835:
+	lo->lo_state = Lo_bound;

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.
