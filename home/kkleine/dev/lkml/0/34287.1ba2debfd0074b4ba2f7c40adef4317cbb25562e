all of the assciated code to maintain it.
           ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#116: FILE: drivers/pci/msi.c:883:
+		BUG_ON(irq_has_action(dev->irq));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#204: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:380:
+	struct irq_desc *desc = irq_desc + irq;
+	return desc->action != NULL;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "desc->action"
#204: FILE: include/linux/irq.h:380:
+	return desc->action != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_err([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_err(dev, ... then pr_err(...  to printk(KERN_ERR ...
#220: FILE: kernel/irq/chip.c:156:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "Destroying IRQ%d without calling free_irq\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#221: FILE: kernel/irq/chip.c:157:
+		printk(KERN_ERR "Destroying IRQ%d without calling free_irq\n",
+			irq);
