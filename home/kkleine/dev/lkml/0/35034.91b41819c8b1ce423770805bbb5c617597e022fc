#26: 
Since nearly all pci_module_init()'s are removed from the tree (19 left), heres the patch for

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#67: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:549:
+static inline int __deprecated pci_module_init(struct pci_driver* drv)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
