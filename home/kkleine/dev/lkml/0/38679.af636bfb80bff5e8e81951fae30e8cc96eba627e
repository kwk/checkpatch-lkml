WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct uart_ops should normally be const
#380: FILE: drivers/serial/uartlite.c:290:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#426: FILE: drivers/serial/uartlite.c:336:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
