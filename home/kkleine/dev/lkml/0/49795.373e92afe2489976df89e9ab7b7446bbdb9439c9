Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#677: FILE: kernel/power/power.h:108:
+extern void snapshot_free_unused_memory(struct snapshot_handle *handle);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#761: FILE: include/linux/suspend.h:43:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
