#31: 
Are you certain you will ever see this trigger? Assembly code switches to the special interrupt handling stack prior to calling do_IRQ(), so I can't see how you would ever find yourself on the process stack in stack_overflow_check(). Jan

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#54: FILE: arch/x86_64/Kconfig.debug:38:
+config DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
+        bool "Check for stack overflows"
+        depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
+        help
+	  This option will cause messages to be printed if free stack space
+	  drops below a certain limit.

 #config X86_REMOTE_DEBUG
 #       bool "kgdb debugging stub"
 

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
