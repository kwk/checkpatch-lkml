CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*p)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct tty_buffer)...)
#63: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:268:
+	p = kmalloc(sizeof(struct tty_buffer) + 2 * size, GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
