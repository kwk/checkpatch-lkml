WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#51: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:129:
+			BUG_ON(sh->ops.pending);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'conf->workqueue_stripes'
#76: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:882:
+	if (--(conf->workqueue_stripes) == 0)

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#115: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:2426:
+	if (sh->ops.count && !test_and_set_bit(STRIPE_OPSQUEUE_ACTIVE, &sh->state)) {
+		issue_raid_ops(sh);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#placing-braces-and-spaces

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#130: FILE: drivers/md/raid5.c:3742:
+	if ((conf->workqueue = create_workqueue(conf->workqueue_name)) == NULL)

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
