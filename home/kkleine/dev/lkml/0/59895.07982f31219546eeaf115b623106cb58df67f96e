CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#71: FILE: fs/splice.c:1319:
+	i = ret = do_wakeup = ipipe_first = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#118: FILE: fs/splice.c:1402:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
