CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/smp.h> instead of <asm/smp.h>
#78: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:22:
+#include <asm/smp.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after boot_pda
#100: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:718:
+	static const __initdata struct i386_pda boot_pda;

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

ERROR:INIT_ATTRIBUTE: Use of const init definition must use __initconst
#100: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:718:
+	static const __initdata struct i386_pda boot_pda;

Const init definitions should use __initconst instead of
__initdata.

Similarly init definitions without const require a separate
use of const.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#139: FILE: include/asm-i386/smp.h:64:
+/* This is valid from the very earliest point in boot that we care
+   about. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
