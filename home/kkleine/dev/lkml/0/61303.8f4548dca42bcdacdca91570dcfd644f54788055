WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#121: FILE: fs/buffer.c:1529:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#142: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:74:
+extern int schedule_on_each_cpu_mask(void (*func)(void *info),

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
