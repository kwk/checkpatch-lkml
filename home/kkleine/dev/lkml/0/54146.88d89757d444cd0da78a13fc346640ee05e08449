WARNING:USE_FUNC: __func__ should be used instead of gcc specific __FUNCTION__
#56: FILE: fs/nfs/super.c:665:

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo *	bar" should be "foo *bar"
#143: FILE: include/linux/nfs_fs_sb.h:73:
+	struct nfs_client *	nfs_client;	/* shared client and NFS4 state */

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
