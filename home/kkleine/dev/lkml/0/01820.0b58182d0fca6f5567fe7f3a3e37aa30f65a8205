WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#80: FILE: arch/i386/mm/fault.c:631:
+	BUG_ON(SHARED_KERNEL_PMD);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#bug-and-bug-on

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited before that close parenthesis ')'
#210: FILE: include/asm-i386/page.h:53:
+#define __pte(x) ((pte_t) { .pte_low = (x), .pte_high = ((x) >> 32) } )

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'x' - possible side-effects?
#210: FILE: include/asm-i386/page.h:53:
+#define __pte(x) ((pte_t) { .pte_low = (x), .pte_high = ((x) >> 32) } )

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#302: FILE: include/asm-i386/pgtable-3level.h:156:
+^Ireturn __pte((((unsigned long long)page_nr << PAGE_SHIFT) | $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#329: FILE: include/asm-i386/pgtable.h:242:
+extern void _vmalloc_sync_all(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
