WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 's' should also have an identifier name
#106: FILE: fs/xfs/xfs_trans_priv.h:49:
+void			xfs_trans_update_ail(struct xfs_mount *mp,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
