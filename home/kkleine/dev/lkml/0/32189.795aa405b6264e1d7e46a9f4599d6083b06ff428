#32: 
This function will be useful for other uses as well; for example, taking input  for /sysfs instead of /proc, so it was changed to accept kernel buffers. We have this use for the Linux UWB project, as part as the upcoming bandwidth allocator code.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#66: FILE: include/linux/bitmap.h:109:
+extern int bitmap_parse(const char *buf, unsigned int len,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#90: FILE: lib/bitmap.c:334:
+int bitmap_parse(const char *buf, unsigned int buflen,
         unsigned long *maskp, int nmaskbits)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#126: FILE: include/linux/cpumask.h:279:
+static inline int __cpumask_parse(const char *buf, int len,
 					cpumask_t *dstp, int nbits)

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!kbuf"
#144: FILE: kernel/irq/proc.c:63:
+	if (kbuf == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
