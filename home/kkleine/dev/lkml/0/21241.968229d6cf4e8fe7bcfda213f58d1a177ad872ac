Cc: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>, linux-mm@kvack.org, LKML <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>, stable@kernel.org

The email format for stable is incorrect.
Some valid options for stable address are::

  1. stable@vger.kernel.org
  2. stable@kernel.org

For adding version info, the following comment style should be used::

  stable@vger.kernel.org # version info

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'happend' may be misspelled - perhaps 'happened'?
#52: 
returned happend to have a word with the marker value in it in just the
         ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#70: FILE: mm/migrate.c:953:
+		} else

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
