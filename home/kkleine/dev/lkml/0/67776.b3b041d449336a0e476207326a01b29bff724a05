WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations

+	struct spu *spu = container_of(sysdev, struct spu, sysdev);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#55: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spu_base.c:664:
+extern int attach_sysdev_to_node(struct sys_device *dev, int nid);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
