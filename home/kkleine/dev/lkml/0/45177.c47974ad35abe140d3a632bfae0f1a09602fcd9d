WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct uart_ops should normally be const
#326: FILE: drivers/serial/uartlite.c:228:

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
