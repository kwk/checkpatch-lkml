WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#40: 
# name            <objects> <objsize> <num_slabs> <partial_slabs> <active_slabs> <order> <allocator>

WARNING:COMMIT_COMMENT_SYMBOL: Commit log lines starting with '#' are dropped by git as comments
#40: 
# name            <objects> <objsize> <num_slabs> <partial_slabs> <active_slabs> <order> <allocator>

Commit log lines starting with a '#' are ignored by git as
comments.  To solve this problem addition of a single space
infront of the log line is enough.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#200: FILE: mm/slabstat.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#201: FILE: mm/slabstat.c:2:
+ * linux/mm/slabstat.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#233: FILE: mm/slabstat.c:34:
+	seq_puts(m, "# name            <objects> <objsize> <num_slabs> "
+		"<partial_slabs> <active_slabs> <order> <allocator>");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#289: FILE: mm/slabstat.c:90:
+struct seq_operations slabinfo_op = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
