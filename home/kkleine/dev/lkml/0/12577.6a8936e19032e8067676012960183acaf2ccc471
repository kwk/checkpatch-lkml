ERROR:EXECUTE_PERMISSIONS: do not set execute permissions for source files
#37: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/regs.h

There is no reason for source files to be executable.  The executable
bit can be removed safely.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#37: 
new file mode 100755

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#42: FILE: drivers/net/cxgb3/regs.h:1:
+#define A_SG_CONTROL 0x0

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.
