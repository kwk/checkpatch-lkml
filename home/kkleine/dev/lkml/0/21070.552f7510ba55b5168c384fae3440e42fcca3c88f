ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#58: FILE: drivers/scsi/sata_qstor.c:462:
+	static int spurious = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#71: FILE: drivers/scsi/sata_qstor.c:475:
+	if (!handled) {
[...]
+	} else if (spurious)
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
