CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!ppc_md.get_irq"
#45: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/chrp/setup.c:480:
+	if (ppc_md.get_irq == NULL) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#85: FILE: include/asm-powerpc/i8259.h:10:
+extern struct irq_host *i8259_get_host(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
