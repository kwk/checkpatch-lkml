+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#79: FILE: include/linux/allocator.h:22:
+struct page *allocate_pages(struct allocation_control *ac,

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#85: FILE: include/linux/allocator.h:28:
+void free_a_page(struct page *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
