ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)

(PARAM+EDD_MBR_SIG_NR_BUF))

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#80: FILE: arch/x86_64/kernel/head64.c:37:
+extern char __initdata boot_command_line[];

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces
