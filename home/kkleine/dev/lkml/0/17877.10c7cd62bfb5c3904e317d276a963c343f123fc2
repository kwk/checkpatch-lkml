Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

WARNING:PREFER_FALLTHROUGH: Prefer 'fallthrough;' over fallthrough comment
#81: FILE: fs/cifs/inode.c:889:
+			/* else rc is still EEXIST so will fall through to

Use the `fallthrough;` pseudo keyword instead of
`/* fallthrough */` like comments.

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use * on subsequent lines
#82: FILE: fs/cifs/inode.c:890:
+			/* else rc is still EEXIST so will fall through to
+			   unlink the target and retry rename */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
