WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct file_operations should normally be const
#47: FILE: include/linux/file.h:70:
+struct file_operations;

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#50: FILE: include/linux/file.h:73:
+extern int init_file(struct file *, struct vfsmount *, struct dentry *dentry,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct file *' should also have an identifier name
#50: FILE: include/linux/file.h:73:
+extern int init_file(struct file *, struct vfsmount *, struct dentry *dentry,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.
