Signed-off-by: John Stultz <johnstul@us.ibm.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#194: FILE: include/linux/time.h:95:
+extern unsigned long read_persistent_clock(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_DEFINED_ATTRIBUTE_MACRO: Prefer __weak over __attribute__((weak))
#244: FILE: kernel/timer.c:758:
+unsigned long __attribute__((weak)) read_persistent_clock(void)

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#266: FILE: kernel/timer.c:782:
+	set_normalized_timespec(&wall_to_monotonic,
+		-xtime.tv_sec, -xtime.tv_nsec);

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'now > timekeeping_suspend_time'
#289: FILE: kernel/timer.c:808:
+	if (now && (now > timekeeping_suspend_time)) {

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#291: FILE: kernel/timer.c:810:
+		unsigned long sleep_length = now - timekeeping_suspend_time;
+		xtime.tv_sec += sleep_length;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
