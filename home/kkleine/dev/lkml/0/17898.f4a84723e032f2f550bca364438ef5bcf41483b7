WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#68: FILE: drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c:1737:
+	{ USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, 0x0215, HID_QUIRK_POWERBOOK_HAS_FN | HID_QUIRK_POWERBOOK_ISO_KEYBOARD},

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
