Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#99: FILE: fsck-objects.c:17:
+static int lost_and_found = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#110: FILE: fsck-objects.c:107:
+			char *hex = sha1_to_hex(obj->sha1);
+			printf("dangling %s %s\n", typename(obj->type), hex);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#113: FILE: fsck-objects.c:110:
+				int fd, ret;
+				mkdir(git_path("refs/lost+found"), 0777);

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 115 exceeds 100 columns
#114: FILE: fsck-objects.c:111:
+				fd = open(git_path("refs/lost+found/%s", hex), O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_WRONLY, 0666);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
