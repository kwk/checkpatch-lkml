The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#128: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_intr.c:81:
+	num_ovfl = num_ovfl_orig = set->npend_ovfls;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary after an open brace '{'
#198: FILE: perfmon/perfmon_intr.c:151:

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
