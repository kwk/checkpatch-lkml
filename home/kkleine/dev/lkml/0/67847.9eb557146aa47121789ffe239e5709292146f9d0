CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided

+	osb->s_blksize = osb->s_clustersize = 1 << osb->s_clustersize_bits;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
