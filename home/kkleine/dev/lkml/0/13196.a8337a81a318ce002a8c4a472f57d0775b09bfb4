WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 102 exceeds 100 columns
#41: FILE: fs/jffs2/fs.c:505:
+	c->inocache_list = kcalloc(INOCACHE_HASHSIZE, sizeof(struct jffs2_inode_cache *), GFP_KERNEL);

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*s)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct jffs2_summary)...)
#76: FILE: fs/jffs2/scan.c:131:
+		s = kzalloc(sizeof(struct jffs2_summary), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
