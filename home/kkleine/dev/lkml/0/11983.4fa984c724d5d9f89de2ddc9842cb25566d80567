CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#83: FILE: drivers/mmc/mmc.h:32:
+extern int mmc_lock_unlock(struct mmc_card *card, struct key *key, int mode);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#99: FILE: include/linux/mmc/protocol.h:318:
+#define MMC_LOCK_MODE_ERASE	(1<<3)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#99: FILE: include/linux/mmc/protocol.h:318:
+#define MMC_LOCK_MODE_ERASE	(1<<3)

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#216: FILE: drivers/mmc/mmc.c:1504:
+		 * the status register, hiding the error condition */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
