CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*s)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct jffs2_summary)...)
#49: FILE: fs/jffs2/scan.c:131:
+		s = kzalloc(sizeof(struct jffs2_summary), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
