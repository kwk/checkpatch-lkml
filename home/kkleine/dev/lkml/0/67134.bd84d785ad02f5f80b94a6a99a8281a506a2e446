#47: 
nonsense and makes an enourmous mess of the irq handling
                      ^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#267: FILE: drivers/pci/msi.c:296:
+static int msi_free_irq(struct pci_dev* dev, int irq);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

#395: FILE: drivers/pci/msi.c:448:
+		/* This pre-assigned MSI irq for this device
+		   already exits. Override dev->irq with this irq */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#commenting

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#420: FILE: drivers/pci/msi.c:561:
+	irq = head = dev->irq;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#650: FILE: drivers/pci/msi.c:846:
+	BUG_ON(!msi_lookup_irq(dev, PCI_CAP_ID_MSI));

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#846: FILE: drivers/pci/msi.c:1089:
+		} else /* Release MSI irq assigned to this device */

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
