CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines

+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#49: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:277:

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kmalloc(sizeof(*p)...) over kmalloc(sizeof(struct tty_buffer)...)
#99: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:330:
+	p = kmalloc(sizeof(struct tty_buffer) + 2 * size, GFP_ATOMIC);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
