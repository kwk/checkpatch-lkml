ERROR:TRAILING_STATEMENTS: trailing statements should be on next line
#41: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:230:
+	while (test_bit(TASKLET_STATE_RUN, &(t)->state)) { cpu_relax(); }

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#41: FILE: include/linux/interrupt.h:230:
+	while (test_bit(TASKLET_STATE_RUN, &(t)->state)) { cpu_relax(); }

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
