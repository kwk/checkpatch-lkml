#44: 
Yes and the second ugliness was that ipv4/udp.c suddenly had to include <net/addrconf.h>. 

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: include/net/udp.h:50:
+extern int	udp_get_port(struct sock *sk, unsigned short snum,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
#199: FILE: net/ipv4/udp.c:199:

+			     || sk2->sk_bound_dev_if == sk->sk_bound_dev_if) &&

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#238: FILE: net/ipv4/udp.c:229:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
