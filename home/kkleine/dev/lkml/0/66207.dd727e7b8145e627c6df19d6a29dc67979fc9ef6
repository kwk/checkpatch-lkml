WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#55: FILE: drivers/w1/Kconfig:14:
+config W1_CON
+	depends on CONNECTOR
+	bool "Userspace communication over connector"
+	default y
+	--- help ---
+	  This allows to communicate with userspace using connector [Documentation/connector].
+	  There are three types of messages between w1 core and userspace:
+	  1. Events. They are generated each time new master or slave device found
+		either due to automatic or requested search.
+	  2. Userspace commands. Includes read/write and search/alarm search comamnds.
+	  3. Replies to userspace commands.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'comamnds' may be misspelled - perhaps 'commands'?
#64: FILE: drivers/w1/Kconfig:23:
+	  2. Userspace commands. Includes read/write and search/alarm search comamnds.
 	                                                                     ^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 124 exceeds 100 columns
#94: FILE: drivers/w1/w1_netlink.c:30:
+#if defined(CONFIG_W1_CON) && (defined(CONFIG_CONNECTOR) || (defined(CONFIG_CONNECTOR_MODULE) && defined(CONFIG_W1_MODULE)))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
