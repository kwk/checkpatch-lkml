CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: include/linux/platform_device.h:42:
+extern int platform_device_add_data(struct platform_device *pdev, const void *data, size_t size);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
