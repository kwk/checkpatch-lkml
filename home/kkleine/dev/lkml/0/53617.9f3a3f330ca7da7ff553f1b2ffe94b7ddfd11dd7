WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'dmi_save_oem_strings_devices', this function's name, in a string
#90: FILE: drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c:139:
+			   "dmi_save_oem_strings_devices: out of memory.\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
