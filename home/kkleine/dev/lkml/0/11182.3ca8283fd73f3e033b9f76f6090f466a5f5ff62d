Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.
