ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#83: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c:223:
+static int num_force_kipmid = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#109: FILE: drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c:934:
+ ^Ielse if ((new_smi->si_type != SI_BT) && (!new_smi->irq))$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation
