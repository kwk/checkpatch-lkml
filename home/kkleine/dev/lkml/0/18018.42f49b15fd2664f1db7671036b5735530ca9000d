CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#125: FILE: include/linux/pci.h:622:
+extern void pci_no_msi(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#145: FILE: drivers/acpi/bus.c:642:
+	if (!pci_allow_msi &&
+	   (acpi_fadt.iapc_boot_arch & BAF_MSI_NOT_SUPPORTED)) {

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_dbg([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_dbg(dev, ... then pr_debug(...  to printk(KERN_DEBUG ...
#146: FILE: drivers/acpi/bus.c:643:
+		printk(KERN_DEBUG PREFIX "MSI not supported, disabling it\n");

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#175: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:24:
+		    * MSI_NOT_SUPPORTED bit so that MSI can still be used */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#186: FILE: drivers/pci/pci.c:1005:
+			else {

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
