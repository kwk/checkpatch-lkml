Adds a generic sched_clock, along with a boot time override for the scheduler

Signed-Off-By: Daniel Walker <dwalker@mvista.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

WARNING:MISPLACED_INIT: __initdata should be placed after sched_clock_override[32]
#163: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6916:
+static char __initdata sched_clock_override[32];

It is possible to use section markers on variables in a way
which gcc doesn't understand (or at least not the way the
developer intended)::

  static struct __initdata samsung_pll_clock exynos4_plls[nr_plls] = {

does not put exynos4_plls in the .initdata section. The __initdata
marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, except right after
"struct". The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1377655732.3619.19.camel@joe-AO722/

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#170: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6923:
+static int __init boot_override_sched_clocksource(char* str)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#202: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6955:
+	if (*sched_clock_override != 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!sched_clocksource"
#204: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6957:
+		if (unlikely(sched_clocksource == NULL)) {

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
