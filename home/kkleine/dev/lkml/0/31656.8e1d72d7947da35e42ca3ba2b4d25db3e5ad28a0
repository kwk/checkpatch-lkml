#33: 
timer functionality.  The sched_tick timer is reprogrammed to a longer timeout

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#107: FILE: include/linux/hrtimer.h:324:
+extern void hrtimer_stop_sched_tick(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#352: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:707:
+		if (base->idle_sleeps) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u64' over 'uint64_t'

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#358: FILE: kernel/hrtimer.c:713:

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
