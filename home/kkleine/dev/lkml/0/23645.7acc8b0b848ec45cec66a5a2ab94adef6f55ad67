CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#54: FILE: include/asm-i386/desc.h:84:
+	u32 *lp = (u32 *)((char *)dt + entry*8);
+	lp[0] = entry_low;

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
