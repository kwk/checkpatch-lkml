CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#56: FILE: include/linux/platform_device.h:64:
+extern int platform_driver_probe(struct platform_driver *driver,

files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#57: FILE: include/linux/platform_device.h:65:
+extern int platform_driver_probe(struct platform_driver *driver,
+		int (*probe)(struct platform_device *));
