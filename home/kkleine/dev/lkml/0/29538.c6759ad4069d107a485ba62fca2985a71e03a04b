WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct o2hb_region *' should also have an identifier name
#94: FILE: fs/ocfs2/cluster/heartbeat.c:1446:
+	ssize_t (*show)(struct o2hb_region *, struct seq_file *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
