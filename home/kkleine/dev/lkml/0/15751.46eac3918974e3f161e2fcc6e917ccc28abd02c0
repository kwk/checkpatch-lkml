#34: 
ATI SB600 SATA controller supports 4 modes: Legacy IDE, Native IDE, AHCI and RAID. Legacy/Native IDE mode is designed for compatibility with some old OS without AHCI driver but looses SATAII/AHCI features such as NCQ. This patch will make SB600 SATA run in AHCI mode even if it was set as IDE mode by system BIOS.
