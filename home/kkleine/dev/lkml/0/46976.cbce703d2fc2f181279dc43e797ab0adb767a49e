ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 123 exceeds 100 columns
#92: FILE: drivers/net/ipg.c:575:
+		MacCtrlValue &= ~IPG_MC_DUPLEX_SELECT_FD & ~IPG_MC_TX_FLOW_CONTROL_ENABLE & ~IPG_MC_RX_FLOW_CONTROL_ENABLE;

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
