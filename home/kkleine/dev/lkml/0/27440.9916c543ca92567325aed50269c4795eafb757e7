#28: 
This patch replaces occurences of task->signal->session by a new 
                    ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#63: FILE: arch/mips/kernel/irixelf.c:1152:
+	psinfo.pr_sid = prstatus.pr_sid = process_session(current);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#157: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:3337:
 		printk(KERN_NOTICE "SAK: killed process %d"
+			" (%s): process_session(p)==tty->session\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.
