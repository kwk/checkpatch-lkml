ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#27: 
--- a/include/asm-i386/pgtable-2level.h	Thu Oct 19 03:03:09 2006 -0700

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20150611134006.9df79a893e3636019ad2759e@linux-foundation.org/

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#63: FILE: include/asm-i386/pgtable.h:331:
+	pte_t pte = raw_ptep_get_and_clear(ptep);
+	pte_update(mm, addr, ptep);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
