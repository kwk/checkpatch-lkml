#43: 
task struct is held across the filldir so the incremental patch should look like:

ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#60: FILE: fs/proc/base.c:2189:
+            put_task_struct(task), task = next_tgid(tgid + 1)) {$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
