+	return (srcu_read_lock(&srcu_ctl));

return is not a function and as such doesn't need parentheses::

  return (bar);

can simply be::

  return bar;

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: that open brace { should be on the previous line

 static struct rcu_torture_ops *torture_ops[] =

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.
