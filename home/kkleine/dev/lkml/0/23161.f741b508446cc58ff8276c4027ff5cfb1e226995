CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "list"
#129: FILE: fs/dcache.c:405:
+	int have_list = list != NULL;

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#265: FILE: fs/dcache.c:709:
+static int select_parent(struct dentry * parent, struct list_head *new)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
