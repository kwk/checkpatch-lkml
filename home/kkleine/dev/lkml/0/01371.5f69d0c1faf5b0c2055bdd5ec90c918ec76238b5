WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
#145: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:86:
+	void (*fn)(unsigned long, nodemask_t *); /* A callback function */

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#178: FILE: mm/pdflush.c:224:
+		if (nodes) {
[...]
+		} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
