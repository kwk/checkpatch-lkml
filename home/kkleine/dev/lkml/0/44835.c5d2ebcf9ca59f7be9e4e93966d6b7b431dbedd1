WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 119 exceeds 100 columns
#141: FILE: arch/sparc64/kernel/systbls.S:82:
+/*300*/	.word compat_sys_set_robust_list, compat_sys_get_robust_list, sys_nis_syscall, sys_nis_syscall, sys_nis_syscall

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#300: FILE: kernel/bc/sys.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FILENAME: It's generally not useful to have the filename in the file
#301: FILE: kernel/bc/sys.c:2:
+ *  kernel/bc/sys.c

Embedding the complete filename path inside the file isn't particularly
useful as often the path is moved around and becomes incorrect.

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
