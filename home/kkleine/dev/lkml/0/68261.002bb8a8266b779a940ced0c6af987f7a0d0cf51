CHECK:MACRO_ARG_REUSE: Macro argument reuse 'policy' - possible side-effects?
#48: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:172:
+#define SCHED_RT(policy)	((policy) == SCHED_FIFO || \
+					(policy) == SCHED_RR)

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
#63: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3551:
+	if (SCHED_RT(policy)) {
[...]
 	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'param->sched_priority == 0'
#83: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3588:
+	if ((!SCHED_RT(policy)) != (param->sched_priority == 0))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#94: FILE: kernel/sched.c:3600:

 				!p->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_RTPRIO].rlim_cur)
