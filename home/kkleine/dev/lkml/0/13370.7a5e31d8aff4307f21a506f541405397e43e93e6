One way to fix this would be to just make sure they all use iunique and hash

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#237: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1691:
+extern int iunique_register(struct inode *inode, int max_reserved);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#238: FILE: include/linux/fs.h:1692:
