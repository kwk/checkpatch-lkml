CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#107: FILE: arch/s390/kernel/setup.c:494:
+	memory_size = real_size = 0;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
