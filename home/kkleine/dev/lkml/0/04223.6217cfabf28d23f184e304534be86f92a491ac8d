The following patch solves the problem by defering the buffers orphaning

#110: FILE: fs/sysfs/inode.c:233:
+struct inode *sysfs_drop_dentry(struct sysfs_dirent * sd, struct dentry * parent)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#169: FILE: fs/sysfs/sysfs.h:20:
+extern struct inode * sysfs_drop_dentry(struct sysfs_dirent *sd, struct dentry *parent);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
