CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#104: FILE: drivers/char/n_tty.c:1188:
+		if (!tty->pgrp)
[...]
+		else if (task_pgrp(current) != tty->pgrp) {
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#105: FILE: drivers/char/n_tty.c:1189:
+			printk("read_chan: no tty->pgrp!\n");

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#135: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1114:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "tty_check_change: tty->pgrp == NULL!\n");

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'tty_check_change', this function's name, in a string
#135: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1114:
+		printk(KERN_WARNING "tty_check_change: tty->pgrp == NULL!\n");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#146: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:1123:
+	(void) kill_pgrp(task_pgrp(current), SIGTTOU, 1);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tty->session"
#295: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2594:
+	    tty->session == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'filp' may be misspelled - perhaps 'flip'?
#319: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2748:
+		retval = __f_setown(filp, pid, type, 0);
 		                    ^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'real_tty->pgrp != tty->pgrp'
#333: FILE: drivers/char/tty_io.c:2852:
+	if ((real_tty->pgrp != tty->pgrp) && real_tty->pgrp)

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
