CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '<<' (ctx:VxV)
#106: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:92:
+#define IORESOURCE_ROM_BIOS_COPY	(1<<3)	/* ROM is BIOS copy, resource field overlaid */
                                 	  ^

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:BIT_MACRO: Prefer using the BIT macro
#106: FILE: include/linux/ioport.h:92:
+#define IORESOURCE_ROM_BIOS_COPY	(1<<3)	/* ROM is BIOS copy, resource field overlaid */

Defines like: 1 << <digit> could be BIT(digit).
The BIT() macro is defined via include/linux/bits.h::

  #define BIT(nr)         (1UL << (nr))

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#146: FILE: arch/ia64/sn/kernel/io_acpi_init.c:200:
