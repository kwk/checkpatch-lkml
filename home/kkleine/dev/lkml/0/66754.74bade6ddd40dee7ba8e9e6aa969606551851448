WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#65: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

WARNING:SPDX_LICENSE_TAG: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag in line 1
#70: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-rs5c348.c:1:
+/*

The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.
The Linux kernel requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files,
and it is thoroughly documented in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

CHECK:USLEEP_RANGE: usleep_range is preferred over udelay; see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
#148: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-rs5c348.c:79:
+	udelay(62);	/* Tcsr 62us */

usleep_range() should be preferred over udelay(). The proper way of
using usleep_range() is mentioned in the kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/timers/timers-howto.html#delays-information-on-the-various-kernel-delay-sleep-mechanisms

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'befores' may be misspelled - perhaps 'before'?
#195: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-rs5c348.c:126:
+	/* Transfer 4 byte befores reading SEC.  This gives 31us for carry. */
 	                   ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct rtc_class_ops should normally be const
#232: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-rs5c348.c:163:
+static struct rtc_class_ops rs5c348_rtc_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'Avtive' may be misspelled - perhaps 'Active'?
#245: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-rs5c348.c:176:

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*pdata)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct rs5c348_plat_data)...)
#251: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-rs5c348.c:182:
+	pdata = kzalloc(sizeof(struct rs5c348_plat_data), GFP_KERNEL);

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#allocating-memory

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#279: FILE: drivers/rtc/rtc-rs5c348.c:210:
+		u8 buf[2];
+		if (ret & RS5C348_BIT_VDET)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
