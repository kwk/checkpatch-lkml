#36: 
The 2.4 kernel series uses sys32_get_kernel_syms(struct kernel_sym32 *table) for reading the kernel symbols (on sparc64). The size of struct kernel_sym is 64 byte on "normal" arches, but 72 byte on sparc64.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'neccessary' may be misspelled - perhaps 'necessary'?
#43: 
ppc64 defines value in struct kernel_sym as u32 in contrast to sparc, so we have the 2048 units limit here, but this would profit from using vmalloc(), too, since the limitation to 2048 is neither helpful nor neccessary. I lack sufficient understanding of the details to predict the impact on other arches. This patch refers to sparc64 but someone with deeper insight might want to look into this for other arches, too.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^
