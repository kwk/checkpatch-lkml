#198: FILE: drivers/md/dm-cache.c:122:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#324: FILE: drivers/md/dm-cache.c:248:

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.

complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
