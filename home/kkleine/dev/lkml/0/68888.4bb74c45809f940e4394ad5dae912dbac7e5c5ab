WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#30: 
 There is a check in is_reusable to determine if a particular block is a bitmap

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#81: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:74:
+	 * we need to account for it. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#85: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:78:
+		b_blocknr_t bmap1 = REISERFS_SB(s)->s_sbh->b_blocknr + 1;
+		if (block >= bmap1 && block <= bmap1 + SB_BMAP_NR(s)) {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'is_reusable', this function's name, in a string
#86: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:79:
+			reiserfs_warning(s, "vs: 4019: is_reusable: "

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#87: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:80:
+			reiserfs_warning(s, "vs: 4019: is_reusable: "
+					 "bitmap block %lu(%u) can't be freed or reused",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20120203052727.GA15035@leaf/

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#107: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:96:
 				 "vs-4030: is_reusable: there is no so many bitmap blocks: "
+				 "block=%lu, bitmap_nr=%d", block, bmap);

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#121: FILE: fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:106:

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around sbi->s_properties
#137: FILE: fs/reiserfs/super.c:1836:
+		set_bit(REISERFS_OLD_FORMAT, &(sbi->s_properties));

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar
