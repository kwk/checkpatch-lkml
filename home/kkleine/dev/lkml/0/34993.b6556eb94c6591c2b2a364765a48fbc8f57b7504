ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to NULL
#40: FILE: kernel/printk.c:71:
+struct console *console_drivers = NULL;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.
