BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

#132: FILE: include/linux/wait.h:118:
+extern int FASTCALL(remove_wait_queue(wait_queue_head_t *q, wait_queue_t * wait));

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#132: FILE: include/linux/wait.h:118:
+extern int FASTCALL(remove_wait_queue(wait_queue_head_t *q, wait_queue_t * wait));

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#159: FILE: kernel/wait.c:49:
+		struct list_head *next;
+		if (list == &wait->task_list)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
