Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'remove_client_block', this function's name, in a string
#130: FILE: drivers/char/n_r3964.c:1046:
+    TRACE_PS("remove_client_block PID %d", pid_nr(pClient->pid));

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
