CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#75: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:175:
+extern void flush_work(struct workqueue_struct *wq, struct work_struct *work);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#119: FILE: kernel/workqueue.c:173:
+static inline void insert_work(struct cpu_workqueue_struct *cwq,
