CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#84: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:96:
+extern int schedule_on_each_cpu(work_func_t func, void *info);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'void *' should also have an identifier name
#94: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:105:
+int execute_in_process_context(work_func_t fn, void *, struct execute_work *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct execute_work *' should also have an identifier name
#94: FILE: include/linux/workqueue.h:105:
+int execute_in_process_context(work_func_t fn, void *, struct execute_work *);
