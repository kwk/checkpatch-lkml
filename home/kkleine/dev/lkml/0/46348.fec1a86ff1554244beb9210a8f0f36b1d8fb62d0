#27: 
as a follow-up on the email thread "ip3106_uart oddity", i'm inlining the patch that enables UART support on PNX8550 MIPS board, reworked to use platform_driver and with your comments on the previous version taken into account.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }
