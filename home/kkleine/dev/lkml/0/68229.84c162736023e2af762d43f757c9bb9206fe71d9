WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct task_struct *' should also have an identifier name
#65: FILE: include/linux/sched.h:1029:
+int set_cpu_rate_hard_cap(struct task_struct *, unsigned int);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#89: FILE: kernel/Kconfig.caps:15:
+config CPU_RATE_HARD_CAPS
+	bool "Support CPU rate hard caps"
+	depends on CPU_RATE_CAPS
+	default n
+	---help---
+	  Say y here if you wish to be able to put a hard upper limit on
+	  the rate of CPU usage by individual tasks.  A task which has been
+	  allocated a hard CPU rate cap will be limited to that rate of CPU
+	  usage regardless of whether there is spare CPU resources available.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
