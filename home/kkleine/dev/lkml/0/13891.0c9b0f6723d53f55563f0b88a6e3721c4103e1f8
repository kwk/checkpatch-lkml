CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#147: FILE: include/linux/gfs2_ondisk.h:531:
+extern void gfs2_meta_header_in(struct gfs2_meta_header_host *mh, const void *buf);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.
