WARNING:AVOID_EXTERNS: externs should be avoided in .c files
#50: FILE: arch/sparc/kernel/sparc_ksyms.c:90:
+extern void ___rw_read_try(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:VOLATILE: Use of volatile is usually wrong: see Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
#111: FILE: include/asm-sparc/spinlock.h:132:
+	*(volatile __u32 *)&lp->lock = ~0U;

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "(foo*)" should be "(foo *)"
#120: FILE: include/asm-sparc/spinlock.h:149:
+			*(volatile u32*)&rw->lock = ~0U;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
