WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#29: 
Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#61: FILE: fs/proc/internal.h:31:
+extern int nommu_vma_show(struct seq_file *, struct vm_area_struct *);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'kernals' may be misspelled - perhaps 'kernels'?
#97: FILE: fs/proc/nommu.c:79:
+ * - nommu kernals have a single flat list
            ^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#103: FILE: fs/proc/nommu.c:85:
+	vma = rb_entry((struct rb_node *) v, struct vm_area_struct, vm_rb);

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#127: FILE: fs/proc/task_nommu.c:146:
+	struct vm_list_struct *vml = _vml;
+	return nommu_vma_show(m, vml->vma);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#165: FILE: fs/proc/task_nommu.c:183:
+		struct mm_struct *mm = priv->task->mm;
+		up_read(&mm->mmap_sem);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct seq_operations should normally be const
#182: FILE: fs/proc/task_nommu.c:197:
+static struct seq_operations proc_pid_maps_ops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.
