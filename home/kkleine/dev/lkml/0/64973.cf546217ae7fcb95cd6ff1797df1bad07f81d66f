CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#53: FILE: drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c:482:
+		param[0] = atkbd_repeatrate = i | (j << 5);

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
