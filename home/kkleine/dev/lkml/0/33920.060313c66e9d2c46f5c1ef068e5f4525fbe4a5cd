CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'dd->ipath_guid == 0'
#40: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_mad.c:91:
+	if (smp->attr_mod || (dd->ipath_guid == 0))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#52: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_mad.c:135:
+	if (startgx == 0) {
[...]
+	} else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#54: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_mad.c:137:
+		__be64 g = to_idev(ibdev)->dd->ipath_guid;
+		if (g == 0)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#60: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_mad.c:143:

CHECK:SPACING: No space is necessary after a cast
#81: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_sysfs.c:269:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.
