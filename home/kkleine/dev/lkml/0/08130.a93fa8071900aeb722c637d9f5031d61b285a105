WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#97: FILE: mm/vmscan.c:1492:
+	for_each_zone(zone);
+		ret += zone->nr_active + zone->nr_inactive;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
