#63: 
  generic_file_buffered_write() from two sites.  Simpler and cleaner that way.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work
#125: 
--- a/mm/filemap.c~direct-io-sync-and-invalidate-file-region-when-falling-back-to-buffered-write-fixes

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
