CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#95: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:33:
+extern int __cpuset_zone_allowed_softwall(struct zone *z, gfp_t gfp_mask);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

#98: FILE: include/linux/cpuset.h:36:
+static int inline cpuset_zone_allowed_softwall(struct zone *z, gfp_t gfp_mask)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
