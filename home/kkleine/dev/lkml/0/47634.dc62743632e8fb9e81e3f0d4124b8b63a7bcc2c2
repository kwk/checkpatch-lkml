#28: 
Building on the previous patch that expanded the inode numbers in struct kstat

WARNING:BAD_SIGN_OFF: 'Signed-off-by:' is the preferred signature form
#32: 
Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

The signed-off-by line does not fall in line with the standards
specified by the community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#108: FILE: fs/nfs/inode.c:232:
+		 * directly since i_ino may not be large enough */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
