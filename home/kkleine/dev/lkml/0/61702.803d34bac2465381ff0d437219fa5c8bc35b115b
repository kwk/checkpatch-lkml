WARNING:COMMIT_MESSAGE: Missing commit description - Add an appropriate one

The patch is missing a commit description.  A brief
description of the changes made by the patch should be added.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#113: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:260:
+		if (new->flags & IRQF_TRIGGER_MASK) {
[...]
-				       "set. No set_type function available\n",
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#126: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:269:
+				printk(KERN_WARNING "setup_irq(%d) IRQF_TRIGGER"

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'setup_irq', this function's name, in a string
#126: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:269:
+				printk(KERN_WARNING "setup_irq(%d) IRQF_TRIGGER"

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#127: FILE: kernel/irq/manage.c:270:
+				printk(KERN_WARNING "setup_irq(%d) IRQF_TRIGGER"
+				       " set. No set_type function available\n",

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

NOTE: For some of the reported defects, checkpatch may be able to
      mechanically convert to the typical style using --fix or --fix-inplace.
