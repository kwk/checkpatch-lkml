CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#62: FILE: include/linux/timer.h:74:
+extern unsigned long get_next_timer_interrupt(unsigned long now);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#174: FILE: kernel/timer.c:570:
+		struct timespec tsdelta;
+		tsdelta = ktime_to_timespec(hr_delta);

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
