WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#87: FILE: crypto/cipher.c:156:
+	return -ENOSYS;

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.

See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line

+ * ECB mode and ignores their return value. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
