Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:ARCH_INCLUDE_LINUX: Consider using #include <linux/smp.h> instead of <asm/smp.h>
#108: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:33:
+#include <asm/smp.h>

Whenever asm/file.h is included and linux/file.h exists, a
conversion can be made when linux/file.h includes asm/file.h.
However this is not always the case (See signal.h).
This message type is emitted only for includes from arch/.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#133: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:289:
+	for (i = 0; i < MAX_APICID; i++) {
+		apicid_2_node[i] = pxm_to_node(apicid_to_pxm[i]);
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
