ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

ERROR:OPEN_BRACE: open brace '{' following function definitions go on the next line
#133: FILE: fs/fuse/dev.c:328:

The opening brace should be following the function definitions on the
next line.  For any non-functional block it should be on the same line
as the last construct.

WARNING:ENOSYS: ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else
#292: FILE: fs/fuse/dev.c:861:
+		if (oh.error == -ENOSYS)

ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
