ERROR:DEFINE_ARCH_HAS: #define of 'ARCH_HAS_FLUSH_ANON_PAGE' is wrong - use Kconfig variables or standard guards instead
#97: FILE: include/asm-arm/cacheflush.h:358:
+#define ARCH_HAS_FLUSH_ANON_PAGE

The ARCH_HAS_xyz and ARCH_HAVE_xyz patterns are wrong.

For big conceptual features use Kconfig symbols instead.  And for
smaller things where we have compatibility fallback functions but
want architectures able to override them with optimized ones, we
should either use weak functions (appropriate for some cases), or
the symbol that protects them should be the same symbol we use.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#101: FILE: include/asm-arm/cacheflush.h:362:
+	extern void __flush_anon_page(struct vm_area_struct *vma,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct page *' should also have an identifier name
#101: FILE: include/asm-arm/cacheflush.h:362:
+	extern void __flush_anon_page(struct vm_area_struct *vma,

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'unsigned long' should also have an identifier name
