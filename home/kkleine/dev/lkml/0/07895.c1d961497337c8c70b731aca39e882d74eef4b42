> [  851.804875] BUG at fs/jfs/jfs_xtree.c:760 assert(!BT_STACK_FULL(btstack))

WARNING:EMBEDDED_FUNCTION_NAME: Prefer using '"%s...", __func__' to using 'xtSearch', this function's name, in a string
#78: FILE: fs/jfs/jfs_xtree.c:761:
+			jfs_error(ip->i_sb, "stack overrun in xtSearch!");

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
