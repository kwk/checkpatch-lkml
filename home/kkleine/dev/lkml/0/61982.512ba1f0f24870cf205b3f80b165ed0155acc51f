CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#65: FILE: include/linux/clocksource.h:149:
 
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#122: FILE: kernel/timer.c:1042:
+^I^I/* get the ntp interval in CLOCKSOURCE_INTERVAL_SHIFT $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.
