WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 113 exceeds 100 columns
#77: FILE: arch/powerpc/platforms/powermac/sleep.S:48:
+#if defined(CONFIG_PM) || defined(CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_PMAC) || (defined(CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU) && defined(CONFIG_PPC32))

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
