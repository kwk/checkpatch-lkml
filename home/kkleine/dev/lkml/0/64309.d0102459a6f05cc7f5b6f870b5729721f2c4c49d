Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks

+		if (wbc.nr_to_write > 0 || wbc.encountered_congestion) {
 			blk_congestion_wait(WRITE, HZ/10);
 		}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

ERROR:INLINE_LOCATION: inline keyword should sit between storage class and type
#225: FILE: mm/page-writeback.c:328:
+int inline wakeup_pdflush(long nr_pages)

The inline keyword should sit between storage class and type.

For example, the following segment::

  inline static int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }

should be::

  static inline int example_function(void)
  {
          ...
  }
