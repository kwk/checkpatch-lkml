WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#52: FILE: drivers/block/Kconfig:415:
+config SHM_ROOTFS
+	bool "Use tmpfs (shm) instead of ramfs for rootfs"
+	depends on BLK_DEV_INITRD
+	default n
+	select TMPFS
+	select SHMEM
+	help
+	  This option switches rootfs so that it uses tmpfs rather than ramfs
+	  for it's file storage.  This makes rootfs swappable so having a large
+	  initrd or initramfs image won't eat up valuable RAM.
+

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.

ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#64: FILE: drivers/block/Kconfig:427:
+^Ibool $

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to NULL
#131: FILE: mm/shmem.c:2126:
+static struct kmem_cache *shmem_inode_cachep = NULL;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

ERROR:SPACING: space required before the open parenthesis '('
#144: FILE: mm/shmem.c:2159:

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!shmem_inode_cachep"
#148: FILE: mm/shmem.c:2163:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
