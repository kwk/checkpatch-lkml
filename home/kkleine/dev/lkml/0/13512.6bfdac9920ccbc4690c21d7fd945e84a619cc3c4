WARNING:LONG_LINE: line length of 103 exceeds 100 columns
#43: FILE: drivers/char/joystick/amijoy.c:67:
+			input_report_abs(amijoy_dev + i, ABS_X, ((data >> 1) & 1) - ((data >> 9) & 1));

The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
may be added while invoking checkpatch.

Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.
