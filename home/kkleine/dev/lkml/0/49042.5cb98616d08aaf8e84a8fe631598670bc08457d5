WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct stacktrace_ops should normally be const

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
