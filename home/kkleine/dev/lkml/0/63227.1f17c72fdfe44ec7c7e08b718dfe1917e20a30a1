Thanks Randy.  Since this patch spans maintainers, I'll CC: to Linus and hope for the best.

WARNING:TYPO_SPELLING: 'occurances' may be misspelled - perhaps 'occurrences'?
#51: 
Patch (Re)Description: The patch below corrects multiple occurances of "the the" typos across several files, both in source comments and KConfig files.  There is no actual code changed, only text.  Note this only affects the /arch directory, and I believe I could find many more elsewhere. :)
                                                         ^^^^^^^^^^

Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

ERROR:DIFF_IN_COMMIT_MSG: Avoid using diff content in the commit message - patch(1) might not work

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
