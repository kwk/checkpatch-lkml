ERROR:CODE_INDENT: code indent should use tabs where possible
#55: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:324:
+ ^Ipid_t ppid = 0, pgid = -1, sid = -1;$

Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
spaces are never used for indentation.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation

WARNING:SPACE_BEFORE_TAB: please, no space before tabs
#55: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:324:
+ ^Ipid_t ppid = 0, pgid = -1, sid = -1;$

WARNING:LEADING_SPACE: please, no spaces at the start of a line
#55: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:324:
+ ^Ipid_t ppid = 0, pgid = -1, sid = -1;$

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#141: FILE: fs/proc/array.c:378:
+			struct task_struct *t = task;
+			do {

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
