CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#143: FILE: include/linux/freezer.h:60:
+extern void thaw_processes(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_warn([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_warn(dev, ... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ...
#223: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:177:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING " Strange, %s not stopped\n",

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#224: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:178:
+			printk(KERN_WARNING " Strange, %s not stopped\n",
+				p->comm );

ERROR:SPACING: space prohibited before that close parenthesis ')'
#224: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:178:
+				p->comm );

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#231: FILE: kernel/power/process.c:185:
