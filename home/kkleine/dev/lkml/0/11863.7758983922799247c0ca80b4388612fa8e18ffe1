+  struct cyclades_port *info = container_of(ugly_api, struct cyclades_port, tqueue);$

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#177: FILE: drivers/isdn/hysdn/boardergo.c:76:
+	hysdn_card * card = container_of(ugli_api, hysdn_card, irq_queue);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
