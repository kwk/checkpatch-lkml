ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#53: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:423:
+static struct kobject * get_device_parent(struct device *dev,

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#130: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:1048:
+	if (new_parent) {
[...]
+	else
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

ERROR:ELSE_AFTER_BRACE: else should follow close brace '}'
#140: FILE: drivers/base/core.c:1058:
+	}

`else {` should follow the closing block `}` on the same line.
