Some words may have been misspelled.  Consider reviewing them.

WARNING:FUNCTION_ARGUMENTS: function definition argument 'struct device *' should also have an identifier name
#76: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/css.h:188:
+int subchannel_add_files (struct device *);

This warning is emitted due to any of the following reasons:

  1. Arguments for the function declaration do not follow
     the identifier name.  Example::

       void foo
       (int bar, int baz)

     This should be corrected to::

       void foo(int bar, int baz)

  2. Some arguments for the function definition do not
     have an identifier name.  Example::

       void foo(int)

     All arguments should have identifier names.

WARNING:SPACING: space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
#103: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device.c:511:
+int subchannel_add_files (struct device *dev)

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#111: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device.c:685:
+static struct ccw_device * io_subchannel_allocate_dev(struct subchannel *sch)

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

CHECK:ALLOC_SIZEOF_STRUCT: Prefer kzalloc(sizeof(*cdev->private)...) over kzalloc(sizeof(struct ccw_device_private)...)
#117: FILE: drivers/s390/cio/device.c:691:
+		cdev->private = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ccw_device_private),

The allocation style is bad.  In general for family of
allocation functions using sizeof() to get memory size,
constructs like::

  p = alloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)

should be::

  p = alloc(sizeof(*p), ...)
