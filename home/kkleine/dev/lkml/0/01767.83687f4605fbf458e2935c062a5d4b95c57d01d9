CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#44: FILE: include/linux/mm.h:1033:
+extern int install_special_mapping(struct mm_struct *mm,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#59: FILE: mm/mmap.c:2098:

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:AVOID_BUG: Avoid crashing the kernel - try using WARN_ON & recovery code rather than BUG() or BUG_ON()
#65: FILE: mm/mmap.c:2104:
+	BUG_ON(address < vma->vm_start || address >= vma->vm_end);

BUG() or BUG_ON() should be avoided totally.
Use WARN() and WARN_ON() instead, and handle the "impossible"
error condition as gracefully as possible.

WARNING:LINE_SPACING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#73: FILE: mm/mmap.c:2112:
+		struct page *page = *pages;
+		get_page(page);

WARNING:CONST_STRUCT: struct vm_operations_struct should normally be const
#87: FILE: mm/mmap.c:2126:
+static struct vm_operations_struct special_mapping_vmops = {

Using const is generally a good idea.  Checkpatch reads
a list of frequently used structs that are always or
almost always constant.

The existing structs list can be viewed from
`scripts/const_structs.checkpatch`.

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!vma"
#108: FILE: mm/mmap.c:2147:
+	if (unlikely(vma == NULL))

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).
