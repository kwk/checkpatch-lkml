Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

#432: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd.c:1347:
+		for (orig = cqr; orig->refers != NULL; orig = orig->refers);

Trailing statements (for example after any conditional) should be
on the next line.
Statements, such as::

  if (x == y) break;

should be::

  if (x == y)
          break;

#432: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd.c:1347:
+		for (orig = cqr; orig->refers != NULL; orig = orig->refers);

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#493: FILE: drivers/s390/block/dasd.c:1401:

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
