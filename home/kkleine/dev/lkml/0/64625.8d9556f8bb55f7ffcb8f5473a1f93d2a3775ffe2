ERROR:TRAILING_WHITESPACE: trailing whitespace
#51: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:343:
+^I$

Trailing whitespace should always be removed.
Some editors highlight the trailing whitespace and cause visual
distractions when editing files.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#spaces

WARNING:PRINTK_WITHOUT_KERN_LEVEL: printk() should include KERN_<LEVEL> facility level
#54: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:346:

WARNING:SPLIT_STRING: quoted string split across lines
#55: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:347:
+			printk("Out of space while seeking to allocate "
+					"header pages,\n");

Quoted strings that appear as messages in userspace and can be
grepped, should not be split across multiple lines.

CHECK:BRACES: Blank lines aren't necessary before a close brace '}'
#60: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:352:
+
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

WARNING:BLOCK_COMMENT_STYLE: Block comments use a trailing */ on a separate line
#65: FILE: kernel/power/suspend_swap.c:357:
+	 * we are now sitting on the first pageset2 page. */

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-
line comments is::

  /*
  * This is the preferred style
  * for multi line comments.
  */

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

  /* This is the preferred comment style
  * for files in net/ and drivers/net/
  */
