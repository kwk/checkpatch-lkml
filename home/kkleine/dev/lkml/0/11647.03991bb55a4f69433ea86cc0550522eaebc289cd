ERROR:INITIALISED_STATIC: do not initialise statics to 0
#81: FILE: drivers/char/sysrq.c:46:
+static int __read_mostly sysrq_always_enabled = 0;

Static variables should not be initialized explicitly to zero.
Your compiler (or rather your loader) automatically does
it for you.

WARNING:PREFER_PR_LEVEL: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...

CHECK:UNDOCUMENTED_SETUP: __setup appears un-documented -- check Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#176: FILE: include/linux/sysrq.h:40:
+extern int sysrq_on(void);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please use a blank line after function/struct/union/enum declarations

 }
+static inline void handle_sysrq(int key, struct tty_struct *tty)

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.
