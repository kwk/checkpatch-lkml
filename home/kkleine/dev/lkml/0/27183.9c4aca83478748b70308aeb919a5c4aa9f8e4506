#33: 
Reimplement execvp for our purposes - after we call fork() it is fundamentally

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#64: FILE: arch/um/include/os.h:237:
+extern int execvp_noalloc(char *buf, const char *file, char *const argv[]);

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

WARNING:FILE_PATH_CHANGES: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?
#97: 
new file mode 100644

Whenever files are added, moved, or deleted, the MAINTAINERS file
patterns can be out of sync or outdated.

So MAINTAINERS might need updating in these cases.

Kernel maintainers reject new instances of the GPL boilerplate paragraph

FSF has moved in the past and may do so again.
So do not write paragraphs about writing to the Free Software Foundation's

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#142: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/execvp.c:41:
+	if (*file == '\0') {
+		return -ENOENT;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

#285: FILE: arch/um/os-Linux/helper.c:48:

Embedded function names are less appropriate to use as
refactoring can cause function renaming.  Prefer the use of
"%s", __func__ to embedded function names.

Note that this does not work with -f (--file) checkpatch option
as it depends on patch context providing the function name.
