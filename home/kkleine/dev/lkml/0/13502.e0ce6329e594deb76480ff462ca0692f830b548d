WARNING:TRAILING_SEMICOLON: trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies otherwise
#40: FILE: drivers/net/wavelan.c:2298:
 			if (copy_to_user(wrq->u.data.pointer,
 					 lp->his_sum,
+					 sizeof(long) * lp->his_number));
 				ret = -EFAULT;

Macro definition should not end with a semicolon. The macro
invocation style should be consistent with function calls.
This can prevent any unexpected code paths::

  #define MAC do_something;

If this macro is used within a if else statement, like::

  if (some_condition)
          MAC;

  else
          do_something;

Then there would be a compilation error, because when the macro is
expanded there are two trailing semicolons, so the else branch gets
orphaned.
