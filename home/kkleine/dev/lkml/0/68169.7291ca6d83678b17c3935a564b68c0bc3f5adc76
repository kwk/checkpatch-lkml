+         The virtual terminal is the device that interacts with the physical
+         terminal through console drivers. On these systems, at least one
+         console driver is loaded. In other configurations, additional console
+         drivers may be enabled, such as the framebuffer console. If more than
+         1 console driver is enabled, setting this to 'y' will allow you to
+         select the console driver that will serve as the backend for the
+         virtual terminals.
+
+	 See <file:Documentation/console/console.txt> for more
+	 information. For framebuffer console users, please refer to
+	 <file:Documentation/fb/fbcon.txt>.

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
