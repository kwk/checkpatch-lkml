#76: 
--- a/include/linux/interrupt.h~lockdep-add-disable-enable_irq_lockdep-api-fix

Avoid having diff content in commit message.
This causes problems when one tries to apply a file containing both
the changelog and the diff because patch(1) tries to apply the diff
which it found in the changelog.
