Subject: [RFC][PATCH] PM: Use suspend_console in swsusp and make it configureable
                                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING:CONFIG_DESCRIPTION: please write a help paragraph that fully describes the config symbol
#196: FILE: kernel/power/Kconfig:39:
+config PM_DISABLE_CONSOLE_SUSPEND
+	bool "Keep console(s) enabled during suspend/resume (DANGEROUS)"
+	depends on PM && PM_DEBUG
+	default n
+	---help---
+	This option turns off the console suspend mechanism that prevents
+	debug messages from reaching the console during the suspend/resume
+	operations.  This may be helpful when debugging device drivers'
+	suspend/resume routines, but may itself lead to problems, for example
+	if netconsole is used.
+
 config PM_TRACE
+	bool "Suspend/resume event tracing (DANGEROUS)"
+	bool "Suspend/resume event tracing (DANGEROUS)"
 	depends on PM && PM_DEBUG && X86_32 && EXPERIMENTAL
 	default n
 	---help---

Kconfig symbols should have a help text which fully describes
it.
