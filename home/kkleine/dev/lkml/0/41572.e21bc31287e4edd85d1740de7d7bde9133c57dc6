ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#150: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6779:
+	struct dentry * root;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);

ERROR:ASSIGN_IN_IF: do not use assignment in if condition
#152: FILE: kernel/sched.c:6781:

Do not use assignments in if condition.
Example::

  if ((foo = bar(...)) < BAZ) {

should be written as::

  foo = bar(...);
  if (foo < BAZ) {
