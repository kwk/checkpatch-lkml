CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Scsi_Host>
#89: FILE: drivers/scsi/hosts.c:300:
+	memleak_padding(shost, 0, sizeof(struct Scsi_Host));

Avoid CamelCase Identifiers.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#naming

CHECK:BRACES: braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement
#144: FILE: kernel/params.c:563:
+	if (!mp) {
[...]
-	}
[...]

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:BRACES: Unbalanced braces around else statement
#148: FILE: kernel/params.c:566:
+	} else

CHECK:CAMELCASE: Avoid CamelCase: <Qdisc>
#185: FILE: net/sched/sch_generic.c:430:
