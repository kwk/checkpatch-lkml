CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!dev"
#54: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/pci-dma.c:49:
+	if (dev == NULL)

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

CHECK:SPACING: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)

Whitespace style used in the kernel sources is described in kernel docs.

CHECK:AVOID_EXTERNS: extern prototypes should be avoided in .h files
#74: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:139:
+extern struct page *alloc_pages_range(unsigned long low, unsigned long high,

Function prototypes don't need to be declared extern in .h
files.  It's assumed by the compiler and is unnecessary.

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#75: FILE: include/linux/gfp.h:140:
+extern struct page *alloc_pages_range(unsigned long low, unsigned long high,
+			int nid, gfp_t gfp_mask, unsigned int order);

CHECK:PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#92: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1201:
+static struct page *rmqueue_range(unsigned long low, unsigned long high,
+				struct zone *zone, unsigned int order)

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#94: FILE: mm/page_alloc.c:1203:
+	struct free_area * area;

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
