WARNING:COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE: Possible unwrapped commit description (prefer a maximum 75 chars per line)
#22: 
kvm defines memory in "slots", more or less corresponding to the DIMM slots.

CHECK:MULTIPLE_ASSIGNMENTS: multiple assignments should be avoided
#79: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c:717:
+	new = old = *memslot;

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.

WARNING:UNSPECIFIED_INT: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'
#134: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c:772:
+		unsigned dirty_bytes = ALIGN(npages, BITS_PER_LONG) / 8;

CHECK:LINE_SPACING: Please don't use multiple blank lines
#220: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c:858:
+
+

Vertical space is wasted given the limited number of lines an
editor window can display when multiple blank lines are used.

WARNING:SIZEOF_PARENTHESIS: sizeof kvm_mem should be sizeof(kvm_mem)
#256: FILE: drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c:1298:

WARNING:SIZEOF_PARENTHESIS: sizeof log should be sizeof(log)
