The source file is missing or has an improper SPDX identifier tag.

The comment style is incorrect.  The preferred style for multi-

  /*
  * This is the preferred style

The networking comment style is a bit different, with the first line
not empty like the former::

ERROR:CORRUPTED_PATCH: patch seems to be corrupt (line wrapped?)
#73: FILE: drivers/char/eqnx/sst_tty.c:4:

The patch seems to be corrupted or lines are wrapped.
Please regenerate the patch file before sending it to the maintainer.

ERROR:GLOBAL_INITIALISERS: do not initialise globals to 0
#84: FILE: drivers/char/eqnx/sst_tty.c:14:
+int eqnx_write_wakeup_deferred = 0;

Global variables should not be initialized explicitly to
0 (or NULL, false, etc.).  Your compiler (or rather your
loader, which is responsible for zeroing out the relevant
sections) automatically does it for you.

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'eqnx_nssps == 0'

+	if ((d > (eqnx_nssps * MAXCHNL_BRD)) || (eqnx_nssps == 0) || (d
< 0))

Parentheses are not required in the following cases:

  1. Function pointer uses::

      (foo->bar)();

    could be::

      foo->bar();

  2. Comparisons in if::

      if ((foo->bar) && (foo->baz))
      if ((foo == bar))

    could be::

      if (foo->bar && foo->baz)
      if (foo == bar)

  3. addressof/dereference single Lvalues::

      &(foo->bar)
      *(foo->bar)

    could be::

      &foo->bar
      *foo->bar

CHECK:UNNECESSARY_PARENTHESES: Unnecessary parentheses around 'd
< 0'
#130: FILE: drivers/char/eqnx/sst_tty.c:52:
+	if ((d > (eqnx_nssps * MAXCHNL_BRD)) || (eqnx_nssps == 0) || (d

WARNING:BRACES: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
#136: FILE: drivers/char/eqnx/sst_tty.c:56:
+	if (tty->termios == NULL) {
+		*tty->termios = *mpc->normaltermios;
+	}

The placement of braces is stylistically incorrect.
The preferred way is to put the opening brace last on the line,
and put the closing brace first::

  if (x is true) {
          we do y
  }

This applies for all non-functional blocks.
However, there is one special case, namely functions: they have the
opening brace at the beginning of the next line, thus::

  int function(int x)
  {
          body of function
  }

CHECK:COMPARISON_TO_NULL: Comparison to NULL could be written "!tty->termios"
#136: FILE: drivers/char/eqnx/sst_tty.c:56:

Comparisons to NULL in the form (foo == NULL) or (foo != NULL)
are better written as (!foo) and (foo).

Multiple assignments on a single line makes the code unnecessarily
complicated. So on a single line assign value to a single variable
only, this makes the code more readable and helps avoid typos.
