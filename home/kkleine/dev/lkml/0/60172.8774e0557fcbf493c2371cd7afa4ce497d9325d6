CHECK:PREFER_KERNEL_TYPES: Prefer kernel type 'u16' over 'uint16_t'
#137: FILE: drivers/net/e1000/e1000_hw.c:115:
+				      uint16_t words, uint16_t *data);

ERROR:POINTER_LOCATION: "foo* bar" should be "foo *bar"
#139: FILE: drivers/net/e1000/e1000_hw.c:117:
+				    uint8_t* data);

When using pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
the preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name
and not adjacent to the type name.
Examples::

  char *linux_banner;
  unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
  char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
